shall be located in the same watershed as the impacted wetlands or the ratio in apply e replacement wetlands must be of a size sufficient to ensure that they provide equal or greater public value than the wetland that was drained or filled the minimum size of the replacement wetland must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each acre of drained or filled wetland the actual replacement ratios required for a replacement wetland may be more than the minimum subject to the evaluation of wetland functions in future owners may make no use of the wetland after it is altered for a period of ten years unless future replacement to achieve a  ratio occurs the landowner shall record a notice of this restriction in the office of the county recorder in which the project is located f restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished according to the ecology of the landscape area affected a replacement plan that would result in wetlands or wetland characteristics that do not naturally occur in the landscape area in which the replacement will occur will not be approved g the following factors when applicable to an impact or replacement site shall be considered by the city 1 the site contains endangered species listed in minnesota rules parts  to  and the proposed activities would take those species the replacement plan shall not be approved 2 the site contains a rare natural community and the proposed activity would adversely affect the community the replacement plan shall not be approved 3 the site contains a significant fish and wildlife resource  including but not limited to fish passage and spawning areas colonial waterbird nesting colonies migratory waterfowl concentration areas deer wintering areas or wildlife travel corridors and the proposed activity would adversely impact those resources the replacement plan shall not be approved 4 the site contains archaeological or historic areas and the activity would adversely affect those areas the replacement plan shall not be approved 5 the proposed activity would have significant adverse impact on the groundwater quality the replacement plan shall not be approved fridley city zoning c3 6 the proposed activity would have significant adverse impact on the water quality of outstanding resource value waters as listed in minnesota rules  or on trout waters

comprehensive watershed management and land use plans 10 evaluation of wetland functions and values a replacement wetlands shall replace the functions and values that are lost that are lost from a wetland that is drained or killed a replacement wetland should replace the same combination or functions and values provided by the impacted wetland the wetland type index system in minnesota rules  subpt 10 item b uses relative values of wetland functions compared across wetland types to evaluate the adequacy of wetland replacement the city may allow the evaluation of wetlands by measuring and comparing public values specified in minnesota statutes section 103b 335 with the current version of the minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another scientifically acceptable methodology b table 4 minnesota rules part  provides technical specifications for constructing wetland types in evaluating a wetland replacement plan the city shall determine whether the wetland type stated as the replacement plan goal will result from the replacement plan specifications if a wetland type other than the replacement plan goal is likely to result the city shall evaluate the plan based on this determination c the city may consider allowing constructed stormwater detention basins for replacement credit if the basin conforms to the following specifications 1 the basin design uses a twocell system in which the upstream cell has a 24hour retention time for a twoyear storm event  2 the downstream cell is designed for a maximum 12inch rise in water level for a tenyear storm event  3 the standards in minnesota rules part  are followed  fridley city zoning e2 4 the design goal is a palustrine emergent wetland that meets all statutory definitions of a wetland for example soils hydrology and vegetation only the downstream cell can be counted for wetland credit and the replacement plan must include a plan and schedule for maintenance of the storm water basin system storm water basins which allowed for replacement are not eligible for an exemption  and 5 storm water management basins constructed for the primary purpose of controlling or treating stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces or developed areas not conforming to the units in 14 above are not considered wetlands these are therefore exempt from replacement plan requirements when constructed in nonwetlands and also cannot be considered for credit as part of a replacement plan regardless of their location d when wetland functions lost as a result of drainage or filling are replaced by restoring a wetland of the same type and in the same watershed with the same inlet and outlet characteristics as described in e and related definitions the replacement shall be considered to be inkind and the minimal replacement ratio shall be used to determine the necessary size of the replacement wetland the minimum replacement ratio is  requiring two times the impacted area be replaced e if the wetland functions lost as a result of drainage or filling are to be replaced by creating a wetland or restoring a wetland of a different type than the impacted wetland or if the replacement wetland is in a watershed other than the impacted wetland or had different inlet and outlet characteristics than the impacted wetland the replacement shall be considered out of kind and the city shall use the replacement ratios in minnesota rules  subpt b item d table 2 to determine the amount of replacement wetland needed to replace the lost wetland values 1 differences in wetland functions and values among wetland types are to be evaluated and replaced using the wetland type ratio table located and to be applied as specified in administrative rules  subpt 10 table 2 the wetland type ratio table incorporates an evaluation of public values as specified in minnesota statutes section 103b335 for the purposes of comparison among wetland types 2 if a wetland to be drained or filled exhibits more than one wetland type as determined by the technical evaluation panel and more than one wetland type is proposed to be drained or filled the city shall use the following procedure to determine needed replacement the acreage of each wetland type to be converted to nonwetland shall be determined the wetland type ratio table shall then be used to determine the amount of replacement wetland for each wetland type the sum of the replacement for each wetland type shall be the resultant acreage requirement for the wetland type ratio fridley city zoning e9 3 when a replacement wetland is located in a different hydrologic unit than the impacted wetland as indicated bythe usgs hydrologic unit map for minnesota the ratios in minnesota rules  must be followed 4 if the inlet and outlet characteristics of a replacement wetland differ from those of the impacted wetland the ratios in minnesota rules  table 3 shall be applied 5 the city may by local ordinance establish additional local public value to address wetland conservation or preservation issues of local concern these ratios shall have a minimum value of zero and shall be based on wetland management objectives of a local water management plan adopted under minnesota statutes or 1036 6 the required replacement ratio for outof kind replacement shall be the sum of the wetland type ratio plus the hydrologic unit ratio plus the inlet and outlet characteristic ratio plus the local public value ratio if this ratio is less than the minimum inkind ratio the minimum inkind ratio shall be the required replacement ratio 7 in cases of partial drainage the amount of wetland to be replaced shall be calculated using the formulas in minnesota rules  item e 8 in cases where partially drained wetlands are restored to their former state credit may be received as calculated in administrative rules  item f 9 for projects of unusual complexity or replacement plans that have been denied and are being appealed and for which the city believes an alternative evaluation process may produce a substantially different replacement requirement the city may evaluate the replacement plan using the current version of the minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another scientifically accepted methodology approved by the board in consultation with the commissioner that evaluates all wetland functions and values for both the impacted and replacement wetlands when using the minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another board in consultation with the commissioner approved methodology to evaluate replacement plans the ratio of impact wetland to replacement wetland shall not be less than the minimum required further the hydrologic unit ratio the inlet and outlet characteristics ration and the local public value ratio shall also be considered when using the minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another board in consultation with the commissioner approved methodology fridley city zoning b5 10 a replacement plan that fails to meet the requirements in items 18 shall be considered inadequate in replacing lost functions and values and shall not be approved by the city a replacement plan that has been considered by the city and not approved may be revised and resubmitted for consideration by the city the decision of the city to approve approve with conditions or not approve a replacement plan becomes final if not appealed to the board within 30 days after the date on which the decision is mailed to those required to receive notice of the decision before construction of the wetland a notice as required in must be recorded and proof of recording provided to the city 11 wetland replacement standards a the standards and guidelines in this part shall be used in wetland creation wetland creation and restoration efforts to ensure adequate replacement of wetland functions and values minnesota rules  table 4 provides general guidelines for the physical characteristics that each type of replacement wetland should have b the standards in items 1 to 8 shall be followed in all wetland replacements unless the technical evaluation panel determines that a standard is clearly not appropriate 1 water

appropriate use of the public rightsofway the city strives to keep its public rightsofway in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the public rightsofway a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its public rightsofway is frequent excavation by persons whose equipment or facilities are located therein public rightofway obstruction is a source of frustration for merchants business owners and the general population which must avoid these obstructions or change travel or shopping plans because of them and has a detrimental effect on commerce persons whose equipment or facilities is located within the public rightofway are the primary cause of these frequent

for goods and services delivered thereby are using this property held for the public good although such services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens such persons receive revenue andor profit use of public property as a result of all these intrusions in the public rightofway it is appropriate for the city to establish a system of documenting what is placed in the public rightsofway

pertaining to utility fees the fridley city council hereby finds the following that in 200 a successful initiative petition proposing an amendment to the fridley city charter requiring voter approval for tax increases beyond specified inflationary adjustments or to create expand or increase various fees was received and placed on the  municipal election ballot the question was approved by the voters by 57% of all people voting in the election in an attempt to remedy confusing language contained in the amendment and potentially dangerous and costly problems for the city an ad hoc work group met and formulated an ordinance designed to correct the language contained within the amendment the ordinance was reviewed by the city charter commission and recommended to the city council for adoption the ordinance was approved  that in 200 due to the citys increased costs in providing the sanitary sewer storm water and water sales to its customers it was found that an unintended consequence to the city had been created by the amendment by not allowing the city to recover its full costs for providing sanitary sewer storm water and water sales the charter commission recommended adoption of an ordinance removing utility fees from a of the city charter as a defined fee that could not be increased above 5% or the rate of inflation whichever is lower the city council adopted the ordinance  however a successful referendum petition requesting withdrawal of the ordinance was received and placed on the november municipal election ballot the question approving the ordinance failed and the ordinance did not become effective during the 2006 budget preparation and planning it was determined that sanitary sewer storm water and water costs continue to increase due to a number of outside factors beyond the control of the city some of these factors include federal mandates imposing increasingly higher standards for water and sewer higher sewage disposal charges imposed by the metropolitan council environmental services agency and ongoing repairs and maintenance of the systems infrastructure the city council sent a survey to all current city commissioners to query their thoughts about utility rates there was overwhelming agreement that the charter should be amended to allow the city to recover its costs for sanitary sewer storm water and water sales that a proposed charter amendment will help eliminate potential for long term subsidy of sanitary sewer storm water and water deficits  provide cost recovery for federal or state mandates  and maintain all other spending restrictions which requires city council to obtain direct voter approval for programs that increase costs above 5% or the rate of inflation whichever is lower that of the fridley city charter

ordinance a moratorium within the city on the construction of new communication and antenna array towers and on the use and development of property for such new towers thereby amending the city code by adding a new that purpose a preamble the city council of fridley minnesota finds that recent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of cellular communication services these new services called personal communications services pcs will likely require numerous antenna locations throughout the community these antennae may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on towers constructed or enlarged for that purpose the city council of fridley further finds that pcs providers have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission fcc for the minneapolisst paul major trading area mta and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future in addition demand is increasing for traditional cellular services from existing or new providers collectively these entities are expected to begin or continue efforts at antenna siting and construction within the city including requests to construct new or enlarged communications towers because of the recent advent of the technology requiring construction of multiple communications towers current fridley ordinances may not adequately address issues relating to these types of towers such as the appropriate locations for these towers and the conditions under which they may be allowed within the city to provide sufficient protection to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city issues which need to be comprehensively addressed in reviewing the impact of this new technologydriven communications phenomenon include but are not limited to structural and construction requirements and standards colocation to avoid unnecessary duplication of construction within the city as well as setbacks and height limitations the city council of fridley minnesota further finds that there is a need to study these and other issues to determine what regulatory controls may need to be adopted to protect the public health safety and welfare the city has issued a request for proposal to experienced consultants for the purpose of assisting the citys professional planning and engineering staff in conducting a comprehensive study of the possible impact of these towers on the city and to provide with city staff recommendations to the city of fridley regarding pcs and cellular service and other antenna or wireless tower issues time is also required for the citys staff to draft any necessary proposals for amendments to city zoning regulations for the city councils review and consideration the council finds therefore that a moratorium is required in order to protect the planning process and to prevent the construction of enlargement towers and the use and development of lands within the city for such towers pending the completion of necessary studies and the consideration and implementation of new regulations on that subject at the present time it is expected that the necessary study and implementation can be completed within a 180day period b moratorium established  scope  definition or tower 1in accordance with the findings set forth in the

truck traffic in areas surrounding large facilities in the city used for warehousing or similar purposes can and has created a substantial potential for and actual hazard to the health and safety of the citizens of the city moreover the age of the city has created a situation in which areas zoned for industrial uses in which warehouse or truckingbased distribution operations are currently located within the city are near or adjacent to residential neighborhoods that the city council believes that the best use of property in areas zoned for industrial use is in manufacturing and that trucking and distribution facilities not directly related to manufacturing on the site may in fact detract from and deter the citys efforts to attract and grow a strong manufacturing base within the city that recent trends in construction of commercial property would appear to create structures that while not formally designated as warehouses or even initially proposed to be used for a warehouse and distribution facility nevertheless contain the large numbers of multiple docking bays in excess of ten docks and other indicia of intensive truckrelated use that can generate the traffic increases that result in a threat to the health and safety of citizens in the city in the future g7 5 that the city council has found that a study is necessary in order to determine whether such uses should
