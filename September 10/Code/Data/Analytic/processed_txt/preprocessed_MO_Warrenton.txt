missouri ordains as follows of fact i 912009 a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of warrenton missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for warren county missouri dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood ordinance of purpose i 912009 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood a it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d by applying the provisions of this  restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases
