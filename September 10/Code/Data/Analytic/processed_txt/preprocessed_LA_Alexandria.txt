generalspecific prohibitions an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 27524 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges for other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  bypass a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production c an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but not only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs d e and f of this section d if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass e an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the potw within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours f bypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there was no feasible alternative to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraphs d and e of this section g the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in paragraph d of this section  division 10

health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this section uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction
