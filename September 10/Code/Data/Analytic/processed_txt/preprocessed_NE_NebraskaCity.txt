floodplain hazard overlay district  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety general welfare and property of the people of the state the legislature in nebraska revised statutes to 311023 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the flood prone area therefore the city council of the city of nebraska city nebraska ordains as follows  findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation   updated   the flood hazard areas of the city of nebraska city nebraska are subject to inundation that may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities as well as the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others that are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps i selection of a regulatory flood based upon engineering calculations that allows a consideration of such flood factors as the expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this ordinance and is representative of large floods that are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance the base flood is in the general order of a flood that could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the fema flood insurance study dated  and other associated materials as amended  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in by applying the provisions of this ordinance to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that service such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c reduce financial burdens from flood damage borne by the community its governmental units its residents and its businesses by preventing excessive and unsafe development in areas subject to flooding d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance from the national flood insurance program  adherence to regulations the regulations of this ordinance are in compliance with the national flood insurance program regulations as published in title 44 of the federal regulations and the   updated   nebraska minimum standards for floodplain management programs

study town and village of ellicottville cattaraugus county new york january 1998 the city finds 1 adult establishments as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects 2 adult establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other   updated   adult establishments to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult establishments in one area 3 each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating additionally the citys interest in regulating adult establishments extends to preventing
