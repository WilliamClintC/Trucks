elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a onepercent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on  city of manchester mo ecode360

association the board of aldermen finds research and studies of municipalities throughout this country indicate that the presence of sexually oriented businesses is consistently and strongly associated with perceived decreases in value of both residential and commercial properties and the facilitation of illicit and undesirable activities research and studies of municipalities also show that sexually oriented businesses can adversely affect the character and quality of life of a town and can be incompatible with surrounding uses particularly when the sexually oriented businesses are concentrated within a limited geographic area or are located in proximity to residences day care centers schools houses of worship public parks or recreational areas or another sexually oriented business sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually

public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films research and studies show that crime increases in the vicinity of sexually oriented businesses and that a store that sells sexually explicit media and miscellaneous adult merchandise exclusively for offsite use attracts the same soft target patrons causing thereby the same crimerelated secondary effects found for onsite sexually oriented businesses the findings noted in subsections b1 18 raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal  city of manchester mo ecode360  505595 h i j k l behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the
