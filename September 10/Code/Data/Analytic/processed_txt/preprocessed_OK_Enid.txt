set out carchitectural and historic significance of each district 1the city finds and designates the kenwood historic district due to its cultural economic and architectural history 2in particular the kenwood historic district platted in 189 contains some of the finest examples of prairie and victorian cottage architectural styles the district contains certain residential structures designed by the best architects in the area and which served as homes for prominent early day citizens the original architectural and structural integrity of many of the residences still exists 3the city finds and designates the waverley historic district due to its cultural economic and architectural history in particular the waverley historic district platted in 1902 and 190 contains fine examples of a variety of architectural styles including bungalows colonial revival medieval period revival spanish prairie and neoclassical styles the district contains certain residential structures designed by the best architects in the area and which served as homes for prominent early day citizens the original architectural and structural integrity of many residences still exists dregulation of structures no exterior of any structure or site shall be regulated erected moved demolished reconstructed rehabilitated restored stabilized or altered within the kenwood and waverley historic districts unless such action complies with the requirements of this section 1land use regulations the zoning provided in ordinances 8613 and 8617 is in accordance with either the current use being made of the property or the original intended use of the property whichever is more consistent with the overall character of the district the primary use of the kenwood and waverley historic districts is singlefamily residential and the city shall strive to preserve and protect this character in certain instances there may be structures deteriorated to the extent that they cannot be feasibly used as originally intended if adaptive reuse is not allowed in these cases the only alternative is nonuse which results in increased deterioration or pressure for demolition if an owner submits substantial evidence indicating that a last resort to saving the structure is an alternative use the historic preservation commission may recommend to the zoning board of adjustment that a use variance be granted a use variance may be permitted when the resulting conversion of the structure to an alternative use would not compromise the historic cultural andor architectural integrity of the structure or the district if a use variance is granted it shall be for the particular property involved and shall be for that use only should the use discontinue for a period of ninety 90 days such discontinuance shall establish a presumption of intent to abandon and then the property may only be used in accordance with the zoning of the property 2design guidelines anew construction the design guidelines for new construction in the kenwood and waverley historic districts are applicable to the following types of activity 1types of activity aconstruction of a new building or auxiliary structure  bany addition to or alteration of an existing structure which increases the square footage in that structure or otherwise alters its size height contour or outline  caddition or removal of one or more stories  or dalteration of rooflines 2guidelines for new construction aintent  technical assistance these guidelines are not intended to discourage contemporary design imitation and duplication of architecturally significant details compromises the integrity of both the old and the new nevertheless the guidelines are adopted in order to integrate new construction with existing structures in such a way that they harmonize with the surrounding environment of the historic district technical assistance is available to the public citys historic preservation commission when specific projects are affected by new construction guidelines bspecific guidelines i the height of new buildings or additions to existing structures must be no greater than the cornice height of the highest contributing structure within the same block on the same side of the street ii the building setbacks and rhythm of spacing of buildings along the same side of a street within a block must be maintained when new construction is proposed iii the directional expression and sense of entry of buildings along the street facade must be maintained when new construction is proposed further garages should be set back behind the house if that is the prevailing pattern in the area iv the materials colors and textures of new construction must be consistent and compatible with the existing contributing structures within the same block on the same side of the street v the scale the proportion between 2 sets of dimensions of new construction must be consistent and compatible with the existing contributing structures within the same block on the same side of the street vi new construction within a historic district shall be consistent and compatible with existing and prevailing elements of contributing structures in the block with regard to all of the following design elements rhythm of solids and voids on the front facade which is the rhythm of masses to openings rhythm and proportion of window and door openings including the width and height relationships of windows and doors rhythm of entrance andor porch projections relationship of architectural details including shutters relationship of ground cover and landscaping primarily mass and continuity relationship of roof shapes  ie gable hip or mansard walls of continuity which involves the physical ingredients which form continuous walls of enclosure along the streets including walls facades fences trees or a combination of these cwaiver the city understands that some sites may have their own unique problems and may require special consideration a strict interpretation of these guidelines may be waived on a case by case and item by item basis by the historic preservation commission brehabilitation the design guidelines for rehabilitation in the kenwood and waverley historic districts are as follows 1guidelines for rehabilitation aevery reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its originally intended purpose bthe distinguishing original qualities or character of a building structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed the removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible call buildings structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged dchanges which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building structure or site and its environment these changes may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected edistinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity fdeteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible in the event replacement is necessary the new material should match the material being replaced in composition design color texture and other visual qualities repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures gthe surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be permitted hevery reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project icontemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historic architectural or cultural material and such design is compatible with the size scale color material and character of the property neighborhood or environment jwherever possible new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired 2interpretation the secretary of the interior has prepared guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings the city will use these guidelines as a reference when interpreting the guidelines listed above ctechnological advancements the design guidelines for technological advancements relate to certain accessory appurtenances to development which may compromise the integrity of the kenwood and waverley historic districts for this reason the following standards shall be used when addressing technological advancements that have occurred since the district was developed any technological advancements visible from the street facade require a certificate of appropriateness prior to installation examples of same technological advancements are as follows 1synthetic siding asynthetic clapboard siding may be permitted in the construction of a new building if the dimensions colors and textures match that of the contributing structures on the same block bsynthetic siding may be permitted when proposed for any addition to or alteration of an existing structure if such siding is consistent with the dimensions colors and textures of the contributing structures on the same block 2satellite dishes satellite dishes shall be located in the rear yard and screened so that they are not visible from any street 3solar panels and skylights solar panels and skylights are permitted if they are constructed parallel to and project no more than eight inches 8 from the surface of the roof solar panels shall not be visible from any street 4fences walls of continuity subsection d2a2bvi of this section under design guidelines for new construction addresses this concern however it should be emphasized that fence materials should enhance rather than detract from the property they protect the commission suggests wrought iron picket fencing or brick walls to add to the historic spirit of the neighborhood chainlink fences are prohibited unless properly screened by foliage 5window air conditioners window air conditioners should not be placed in the front facade any remote or exterior mechanical equipment should be placed behind the front yard setback and be screened so that they are not visible from any street 6storm windows and doors storm windows and doors are not permitted in the construction of a new building storm doors and windows may be permitted on the exterior of existing contributing structures if such doors or windows are consistent with the original structural design 3certificates of

persons per acre per hour during a 24 hour period not to exceed 50 persons per acre at any time average densities of persons per hour during a 24 hour period are determined by calculating the number of persons per acre expected on a site multiplying by the number of hours they will be on the site and dividing the total by 24 for example one 8hour shift of 30 workers on a 1 acre site average density   30 persons expected x 8 hours on site   240 then 24024   10  thus average density per acre per hour per a 24 hour period another example is two 8hour shifts of 30 workers on a 1 acre site average density   30 persons expected x 16 hours on site   480 then 48024   20  thus the average density   20 persons per acre per hour per a 24 hour period the maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour is calculated by dividing the number of hours persons will be on site by 24 hours and then dividing 25 persons per acre per hour by the result the resulting number is the maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour provided it does not exceed 50 50 persons per acre at any one time is the maximum number of persons allowed under the standard for example the maximum density for two 8hour shifts on a 1 acre site 25 divided by 1624   375 persons per acre per hour allowed application of this formula results in the following table which specifies the maximum persons per acre per

sections 1601 as amended delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city of enid oklahoma ordains the following to become effective immediately bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city of enid are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other property because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve public or private uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands eff 672019 1313 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be

delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city does hereby adopt this stormwater management chapter  1332 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bbecause of its physical terrain and geographical location the city is particularly subject to damage from stormwaters which from time to time overflow from existing watercourses and drainage facilities cthe presently existing stormwater drainage facilities of the city require continuous operation maintenance renewal and replacement da comprehensive approach to managing stormwater runoff is required to address existing and future needs ethe cost of operating and maintaining all stormwater drainage systems and the financing of existing and future necessary repairs replacement improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the benefit enjoyed and services received therefrom frequiring the construction of regional master drainage plan detention sites mitigation of stormwater runoff site detention and payment of stormwater development fees and stormwater utility service charges are the most equitable methods of implementing a comprehensive stormwater management program  1333 statement

currently exist and those determined to be needed and that are intended to be constructed in the future the plan may also show any other information that the director deems desirable bpurpose of plan the purpose of the master drainage plan prescribed by this section is to identify and propose a system to alleviate present and future drainage and flooding problems in the city by means of presenting in an orderly fashion the general data and information essential in understanding the relationship between rainfall and storm runoff the master drainage plan serves as the official designation of drainage facilities drainageways and basins these may be altered from time to time to conform to existing conditions or new information ccost estimate the director may undertake supplementary studies to determine the estimated cost of constructing the drainage facilities shown on the master drainage plan including the expense of any necessary land acquisition dindividual basin plans the citywide

this chapter  1339 stormwater mitigation amitigation required all development that involves the filing of a plat replat site plan or industrial building permit must mitigate the impact of that developments stormwater runoff by performing work on a regional master drainage plan detention site located within the same basin as the development or pay the development fee as outlined in section 13310 of this chapter bamount of work the amount of work to be done at the detention site is the amount necessary to mitigate the entire stormwater runoff caused by the proposed development cresponsibility to mitigate this mitigation work does not relieve the developer from the responsibility to mitigate that developments stormwater impact from the developments site to the main drainage channel of the stormwater master plan the impacted channel if the flow is above the impacted channels capacity anywhere from the development to the main drainage channel the proposed development must detain the stormwater on site or relieve the impact in another manner ddevelopment fee where work cannot be done to stormwater master plan detention sites within the development basin the developer must pay the development fee as outlined in section 13310 of this chapter edevelopments outside limits of master plan the drainage study for a proposed development that is not located within a master drainage plan shall include a plan to mitigate stormwater impact on the properties located downstream between the proposed development and the main drainage channel where on site detention is proposed to mitigate the impact the developer may make application to amend the master plan to add the proposed on site detention to the plan as a regional detention site 1application to add on site detention to the master plan shall include a detailed revised hydrology and hydraulic analysis of the master plan study showing that the proposed detention will provide adequate protection offset certain improvements and not increase the operational maintenance cost or otherwise increase the public burden 2credits under section 13310 of this chapter may issue if the regional detention site provides capacity in excess of what is required to be offset by the proposed development 3if the on site detention is not to serve as a regional detention site it does not alleviate the requirement to pay the
