prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve those uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands passed 4112000  passed 3252014 words and meanings  15115 definitions unless specifically defined

purpose and policies athe purpose of this comprehensive plan 1this comprehensive plan is adopted as a present statement of policy by the city and as a guide for future land use decisions within the city the policies contained herein are intended as a guide for and to be implemented by the citys land use regulations capital improvement expenditures and other programs including cooperative efforts with other governmental agencies and the private sector the plan should be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission on an annual basis and the commission should submit an annual report together with recommended changes if any to the city council 2if the city council determines at any time that any of the policies of this plan should be modified each and every policy contained herein should be reevaluated because of their interrelated nature bpolicies 1general the city of meadows place is predominately a residential community one of the citys greatest attributes is its ability to protect the integrity of its residential neighborhoods and to minimize any adverse effects of commercial development on existing residential neighborhoods zoning power to this end maximum height limits and minimum setbacks are established deed restrictions are also enforced in residential neighborhoods and should be considered in determining land use policies 2residential aexisting residential neighborhoods and existing residences should be maintained and protected use controls and where possible enhanced by public and private investment and improvements 1the density of new or replacement residential development in existing residential neighborhoods should be consistent with and comparable to the densities permitted in the neighborhoods under the zoning classifications in this chapter 2the citys land use controls should promote and facilitate the improvement rehabilitation and where necessary the replacement of the citys existing residences 3the city should make capital improvements including sewer and water service systems and neighborhood roadways which will support and upgrade existing residential neighborhoods ball development in or adjacent to existing residential neighborhoods should be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse effects on existing residential uses and where possible to ensure that new development constitutes a benefit to the residential neighborhood 1where nonresidential structures are permitted adjacent to residential neighborhoods a buffer zone shall exist to allow a transition with respect to size and floor area for structures immediately adjacent to the residential neighborhood 2ingress and egress to all new development near to adjacent to existing residential neighborhoods should be designed so that nonlocal traffic to and from the proposed development will not pass existing residential neighborhood except by way of primary or secondary arterials 3all new nonresidential development or residential development other than singlefamily detached dwelling units should be buffered and screened so that the new uses to the maximum extent practicable are not visible from or intrusive to existing residential uses 3business district aundeveloped and developed land located along and north of west airport boulevard between us highway 59 and kirkwood road excluding present residential areas will become the center of the citys business district  and the city shall encourage the location of new commercial uses in this area bthe economic vitality of the business district should be promoted the land use regulations of the city should permit and where possible encourage the development of structures in the district cthe city should restrict the business district to those uses which are compatible with or which would enhance commercial retail uses office and retail uses which would support the commercial activity in the business district should be encouraged dto further promote commercial activity in the business district the land use regulations of the city should permit parking lots only as accessory uses to commercial retail or office use developments 4us highway 59 ato the extent that the land lying adjacent to and in close proximity to us highway 59 is affected by noise and air pollution and traffic from the highway it constitutes a distinct area within the city the city should take whatever steps it can to mitigate these ill effects protective planning bthe intensity of development on those lands lying adjacent to us highway 59 should be governed by the proximity of any proposed structures to existing residential uses this development should not adversely impact traffic circulation or water or sewer facilities 5lands abutting arterials alands abutting west airport boulevard west of kirkwood road may be appropriate for low intensity commercial andor upper medium density residential uses provided that ingress and egress is limited so as not to unduly interrupt traffic flow on west airport boulevard and provided that new development is screened and landscaped to avoid the appearance of continuous strip development blands abutting west bellfort avenue may be appropriate for low intensity commercial uses provided that new development is screened and landscaped to provide a buffer to the adjacent existing residential neighborhoods 6public services ato the maximum extent permitted by law no development should be permitted within the city unless the applicant agrees to provide the service infrastructure needed to support the proposed development including but not limited to water sewer and streets bthe adequacy and efficiency of the services provided should be maintained at or above present design characteristics cthe city believes that the development of open green space contributes to the health safety and wellbeing of its residents therefore existing parks should be maintained and improved and acquisition of
