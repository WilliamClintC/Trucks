this chapter is to encourage alarm users to assume increased responsibility for maintaining the mechanical reliability and the proper use of alarm systems to prevent unnecessary police and fire

responses to requests made by mechanical devices it is the policy of the police and fire departments to respond to valid requests for service nothing in this chapter lessens or increases that responsibility it is also understood that many requests for service to mechanical activations are not valid calls for service and the resident does not want the police or firefighters to respond c the
