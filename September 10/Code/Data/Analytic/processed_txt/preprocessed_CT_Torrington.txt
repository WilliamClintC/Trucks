applicant shall provide screening for parking areas loading areas outside storage areas and ground fixed mechanical equipment acceptable screening materials may include existing vegetation on the property where the existing vegetation is of a nature that it will effectively screen the use from the view of adjoining properties earthen berms solid fences or walls trees 62 and evergreen plantings

provide the maximum visual buffer between adjoining uses if existing woodlands are located within the required buffer area the applicant is encouraged to preserve these woodlands and supplement with nondeciduous trees berm solid fence or wall to provide the required year round screening the commission may require additional landscaping or more mature plantings where unusual conditions dictate more extensive screening or for noise abatement purposes to reduce depreciation of adjacent residential properties in a residential zone at the request of the applicant the commission may determine that the requirement for a landscaped buffer area is not necessary along a property line adjoining a permanently protected open space or some other similar situation where property values or community appearance would not be adversely affected buffer areas shall not contain buildings accessory structures parking storage areas dumpsters impervious surfaces except as noted below the commission may allow certain improvements to encroach within the buffer areas such as storm systems detentionretention basins underground utilities including sanitary lines access drives for emergency vehicles

73 sedimentation and erosion controls rev   soil erosion and sediment control plan rev 12162010 a the commission finds that trees and other vegetative ground cover play an important role in

coverage is considered to be adequate within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmittal signal is greater than or equal to 95dbm for at least 75% of the intended coverage area it is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage where the signal is less than 95dbm as long as the signal regains its strength to greater than or equal to 95dbm further away from the base station for the limited purpose of determining whether the use of a repeater is necessary or desirable there shall be deemed not to be adequate coverage within said holes the outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage however is that location past which the signal does not regain strength of greater than or equal to 95dbm

feasible restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose 2 encourage innovative design solutions to control the quality of storm runoff from development sites during and after construction natural landscape solutions such as minimization of impervious surfaces undisturbed buffers and filter strips are preferred over structural solutions such as detention ponds 3 encourage the construction of joint detention ponds serving several properties 4 areas adjacent to the naugatuck river may not require storm water detention it must be shown that the existing drainage system to the river has sufficient capacity to carry any additional runoff generated from the proposed development 5 the 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual as amended provides guidance in the preparation of

accordance with the land use for the associated planning zone with no detention upstream detention may be included when determining flows provided the engineer calculates the reduced flows by routing the developed flows storm water facility included in the analysis rather than assuming the reduction will occur the engineer shall show that detention facilities used in the analysis will remain be properly maintained and the storage volume and outlet structure is based on current asbuilt conditions 34 detention facilities shall be designed using predevelopment flows based on existing conditions for all upstream areas postdevelopment flows except the 100year flow shall be based on onsite upstream areas being developed per the development plans and existing conditions for offsite upstream

report and certification showing that the facility meets the current city storm water management requirements c storm water detention required 1 whenever a storm water management report indicates that an adverse impact from storm water runoff is expected to result from the development of a property that project shall be provided with storm water detention facilities the meaning of adverse impact shall apply when predevelopment flows did not cause difficulties and postdevelopment flows do difficulties shall include but not be limited to situations where 25year velocities exceed the nonerosive velocity of the stream or drainage channel habitable structures are shown to be subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood and storm water facilities that can not carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations 2 the city engineer may elect to waive the storm water detention facilities requirement if the applicants engineer certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the city engineer that at least one of the following is true and correct as applicable a the nondetained postdevelopment runoff shall not produce concentrated flows and shall leave the project site as sheet flow and shall not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties b the effect of detention concentrates flows where sheet flow had occurred under predeveloped conditions the impact of increased sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices such as level spreaders were employed c the undetained flow will pass properties in drainage easements obtained by the developer to an existing detention facility which has been designed to manage the upstream propertys runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis which shows that detention is not required d where the site runoff will flow directly into the naugatuck river without crossing offsite properties water quality treatment shall be provided onsite 36 3 should the applicants engineer conclude that storm water

with the city engineers staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project the consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings if the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the predeveloped flows then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs and if there are any existing drainage complaints downstream then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs d detention design criteria  general 1 all storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain the first  of runoff from all roads
