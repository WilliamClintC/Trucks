purpose a intent the ecorse road form based district erfb is intended to implement the vision established by the township master plan and the e michigan avenue and ecorse road placemaking plan to transform the ecorse road corridor into a vibrant dynamic area the attraction of new investment the ecorse road form based district allows for the consolidation and creative redevelopment of parcels development of buildings and sites including retrofitting and redevelopment of existing sites and buildings can include residential retail office and service uses uses designed to support the residents and local workers are also encouraged such as mixeduse developments with small scale retail or restaurant uses incorporated with housing units the redeveloped corridor will help diversify the township housing and commercial stock and incorporate architecturally interesting buildings consolidation of parcels in the district is encouraged in order to provide for a quality and consistent development pattern incentives include additional building forms and more permitted uses b purpose the general purpose of these regulations is as follows a promote new investment opportunities by allowing a wide range of potential uses and techniques to expand the employment and economic base b ensure that development is of human scale primarily pedestrianoriented and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces c ensure that development is designed for all modes of transportation d promote mixeduse development e ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods f improve mobility options and reduce the need for onsite parking by encouraging all modes of transportation parking and street parking g provide predictable development approval process h encourage lot consolidation to provide for larger consistent developable sites c factors for regulation these regulations are based on two significant factors site context and building features 1 site context is derived from existing and desired characteristics of an area and recognizes the inherent conditions of the areas where these regulations are applied regulated sites types are organized by shape size orientation and location 2 building feature addresses the manner in which buildings and structures relate to their lots surrounding buildings and street frontage the shape of the building the land area to volume ratio and the orientation of the building has a significant impact upon the character of an area building form standards control height placement building configuration parking location and building transparency applicable to the site context   1 71619 applicability and organization a applicability 1 any new use or expansion of existing use that requires site plan review shall comply with the requirements of this article and other applicable requirements of this ordinance 2 the requirements of this article shall not apply to a continuation of a permitted use within an existing structure b changes of use within existing structures that do not require increased parking c normal repair and maintenance of existing structures that do not increase its size or parking demand b regulating plan the ecorse road form based district shall be governed by a regulating plan that is specific to the area 1 the regulating plan based on the site type determines building form and allowable use for each property within a formbased district 2 the regulating plan is based on three factors site type  building form  and use group a site types site types as set forth in section 1142a are determined by street orientation lot size lot configuration location and relationship to neighboring sites site type provides the basis for building forms and authorized use groups b building form standards and types building form standards and types set forth in section 1142b and c establish the parameters for building form height and placement and are specifically applied to each district based upon the regulating plan c authorized use groups authorized land uses are organized by use groups authorized use groups as set forth in section 1142d are specifically applied to each district based upon the regulating plan 3 the steps to determine the regulations that apply to a specific property within a formbased district are as follows a find the site in question on the regulating plan map b identify the site type for the site in question sites will be classified site type a b or c c consult the use groups and building forms permitted table in which the site is located the table will identify if a use group or building form is permitted permitted with conditions or not permitted for the site type and street type combination of the site in question d follow the regulations for the chosen building form when designing the development application building form regulations are established in section 1142b and 1142c e follow the design standards as listed in section 1142g f obtain site plan approval or special use approval for the chosen building form and use as appropriate c design standards general design standards set forth in section 1142g are supplementary to other requirements of the ordinance generally the design standards regulate building placement parking orientation landscaping and other site design requirements d modification of district boundaries any modification to the boundaries of any formbased district shall require rezoning in accordance with the provisions of article xxvii changes and amendments e modification of regulating plan specific building form use group and design standards applied within each regulating plan are based upon the designation of site type any modification of site type may be determined by the planning commission notice and after conducting a public hearing in accordance with section 2703 the planning commission shall consider the following in making a determination to modify a site type or street type designation 1 the applicants property cannot be used for the purpose permitted in the formbased district 2 area has been added to or deleted from the subject property in question requiring the modification 3 the proposed modification and resulting development will not alter the essential character of the area 4 the proposed modification meets the intent of the district 5 existing streets have been improved andor new streets constructed that may result in the modification of a specific site type 6 modification to the regulating plan is in conformance to the master plan and placemaking plan f nonconformities nonconformities shall be regulated in accordance with article xxii of the zoning ordinance   1 71619 standards a site types 1 site type a neighborhood residential or mixeduse sites site type a is composed of lots onehalf acre or smaller and is reserved primarily for residential use and for smaller nonresidential use which is compatible with a residential setting site type a is generally located in areas which serve as a transition between the ecorse road and neighboring residential areas the building form selected for these sites must consider both the front elevation that fronts on the street but also the rearside elevation that is adjacent to residential in order to maintain compatibility with adjacent uses 2 site type b neighborhood commercialoffice or mixeduse sites made up mostly of lots between onehalf and one acre in area the site type b category may include free standing singleuse sites developed for
