are compatible with their physical conditions thereby preventing the creation of any new flood and drainage problems 3 to avoid the increase of upstream and downstream flood risks by preventing increased runoff and a redistribution of flood waters 4 to preserve and possibly enhance the quality of ground and surface water resources by helping to control excess infiltration into sanitary sewer systems and by prohibiting the location of septic systems and mixed fills in unfavorable physical environment 5 to preserve and possibly enhance the quality of groundwater supplies by maintaining open and undisturbed prime natural groundwater recharge areas 6 to preserve distinctive floodplain and wetland flora and fauna 7 to consider floodplain and wetland areas in density consideration in zoning

stormwater runoff shall be required for all commercialindustrial developments for all multiplefamily residential developments for all singlefamily developments and singlefamily residences b the release rate of stormwater from all developments requiring detention shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state a release rate of not greater than that

development techniques and ownership methods including conventional subdivisions cluster developments condominium ownership of land and buildings or other ownership techniques the entire development shall be controlled by means of a planned unit development ordinance and site plan which establishes densities and the approximate location of buildings and extent of the features of the planned unit

required access onto a public street be less than five hundred 500 feet in length the requirements of section 403a4 above regarding site topography and soil shall apply as conditions to the dedication of school sites c criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be used solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs the cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the village solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or for the improvements to any existing school site which already serves such needs if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park

body designated as trustee above shall refund such contribution to the owners of record of all lots except lots dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this section in the subdivision for which such

to each lot owner shall be equal to the amount of the original contribution together with accrued interest thereon divided by the total number of lots in the subdivision excluding only those lots which were dedicated pursuant to this section for which such contribution was made 1 fair market value the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value exclusive of any sales costs commission and profits of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites it has been determined that the present fair market value of such land in and surrounding the village is no less than onehundred seventyfive thousand dollars $175000 per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto in the event of any such objection the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village by the park district school district or others 2 criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when only a portion of the land to
