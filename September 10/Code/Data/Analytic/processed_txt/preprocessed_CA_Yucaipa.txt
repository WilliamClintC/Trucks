standards development projects shall provide for adequate vehicular access for fire fighting vehicles to the development perimeter of the project along the portion of the development perimeter that is adjacent to either an existing or proposed fuel modified area or a fire hazard area provisions shall be made and shall be required where necessary of development project approval for the continual maintenance of the areas intended to provide such access perimeter access shall be provided either of the following two measures or alternate measures cited in this i the provision of an existing or proposed road along the development perimeter or portion thereof that is exposed to a fire hazard or fuel modified area and which is accessible to firefighting equipment such a road shall be capable of supporting firefighting equipment shall be at least twenty 20 feet in width and shall not exceed a grade of sixteen percent 16% the conditions of approval for the development project shall require provisions to ensure that the roadway will be maintained if it is not within the publicly maintained road system ii development projects shall provide access ways at least fourteen 14 feet in width with a grade not to exceed sixteen percent 16% and capable of supporting fire fighting vehicles between the development perimeter and proposed or existing streets access ways shall be spaced at intervals of no more than an average of three hundred fifty 350 feet along each street the conditions of approval for the development project shall require specific provisions to ensure that access ways will remain unobstructed and will be maintained where feasible access ways may not be paved and shall be designed so as not to detract from the visual quality of the project b intent of standards the intent of the standards described in b6 is to permit fire fighting vehicles to have adequate access into areas between fire hazardous areas or fuel modified areas and the development perimeter so that a wildland fire can be contained at the development perimeter and prevented from spreading to structures an additional intent of these standards is to prevent structural development from becoming a barrier between firefighting equipment and personnel and the development perimeter c alternate measures pursuant to of this dependent upon site specific conditions alternate measures which meet the intent of the standard in b6a above for providing perimeter access to fuel modified and fire hazard areas may be utilized 5 length of culdesacs a standard culdesacs shall not exceed three hundred fifty 350 feet in length except that they may be extended as allowed by this subsection b exception for parcels of less than five 5 acres in area culdesacs may exceed three hundred fifty 350 feet in length but shall not exceed six hundred 600 feet in length if i alternate measures are utilized pursuant to the provisions of of this   or ii based upon consideration of the recommendation of the fire authority the community development department determines that the culde sac is situated and designed such that the parcels taking access from it are not contiguous to or exposed to either undeveloped fuel modified areas along the development perimeter of the project or to fire hazard areas and that the extension of the culde sac will not increase the exposure of buildings to wildland fires c exception for parcels greater than five 5 acres in area culdesacs may exceed six hundred 600 feet in length if all parcels that take access from the culdesac are five 5 acres or greater in area and i the proposed culdesac is not within or adjacent to areas that are zoned for or subdivided to parcels of five 5 acres or less ii alternate measures are utilized pursuant to the provisions of of this d intent of standard the intent of limiting culdesac lengths is to limit the exposure of development and human activity to hazardous fire areas where one rather than two points of access are provided especially when such culdesacs are directly exposed to fire hazard areas the provision of only one point of access increases exposure to fire and inhibits the fighting of wild land fires due to the following factors i if the single access point becomes blocked structures exposed to fire cannot be protected by fire fighting vehicles ii fire fighting vehicles can be trapped on a culdesac if the single access is blocked iii in order for fire fighting vehicles to turn around they usually must travel to the end of the culdesac where adequate room for turning is available iv all vehicles evacuating a culdesac during a fire will be traveling in the opposite direction to fire fighting vehicles moving into a culdesac impeding the ingress of the fire fighting vehicles as well as the egress of the evacuees v development of individual culdesacs which intrude into and are generally surrounded by rugged wild land terrain have greater exposure to wild land fire because the fire may come from several directions at once e alternate measures pursuant to of this dependent upon site specific conditions one of the following measures or combinations thereof may be used to mitigate the effect of creating culdesacs up to six hundred 600 feet in length with parcels less than five 5 acres in area i limitation of the total number of dwelling units which have access to the culdesac to no more than fifteen 15 and restriction of further subdivision of parcels and construction of additional independent residential units which have access to the culdesac such restrictions shall be imposed conditions of approval of the development project ii a continuous perimeter access road at least twenty 20 feet in width is provided along the portion of the culdesac exposed to fire hazard or fuel modified areas such that it is drivable under normal conditions by fire fighting vehicles provides adequate maneuvering space for such vehicles and is designed such that at least one point of access to the perimeter access road is taken from roads other than the culdesac in question iii the culdesac road will have a paved width of at least forty 40 feet with posted no parking for its entire length and there is at least one area approximately at the midpoint of the culdesac that serves the same function of a culdesac bulb in allowing fire fighting vehicles adequate room to turn around this measure may only be utilized if the expansion of the road width will not contribute to slope stability hazards either on or offsite iv other alternate measures approved by the community development department pursuant to of this 6 alternate hazard protection measures a applicability the following provisions shall apply only to the standards and requirements of subsections 3b regarding building separations  4b6 regarding perimeter access  and 4b7 regarding length of culdesacs b intent the intent of this subsection is to allow greater design flexibility than would otherwise be permitted in order to provide a more efficient and effective achievement of the purposes of the fire safety regulations design flexibility is provided by allowing the substitution of alternate measures for the established standards or requirements if it is found that they provide the same or a greater level of protection from wildland fires and other natural hazards and that they will fulfill the same purpose as the established standard or requirements c substitution of alternative measures for standards and requirements i if alternative measures are proposed the fire department shall determine with specific consideration of the effect of the proposed alternative measures whether the proposed development project has adequate provisions for fuel modification and management including the ongoing maintenance of fuel modified areas ii if the fire department makes a positive determination pursuant to c1 of this then alternate measures may be substituted for the established

codealert this topic has been affected by to view amendments and newly added provisions please refer to the codealert amendment list  purpose and findings a findings complaints concerning excessive rents by tenants of mobilehome parks led the city council to conduct a study of the situation in the mobilehome parks in the city as a result of that study staff investigation and testimony at public hearings held by the city the city found an extremely low vacancy rate and a pattern of excessive rent increases beginning as early as 198 when rent control was first sought from the county board of supervisors for the yucaipa area excessive rent was an issue in the 1986 incorporation campaign which resulted in the filing of a petition with the local agency formation commission lafco on  and again in the 1989 incorporation petition filed with lafco on  which resulted in the incorporation of the city on  the fortythree 43 mobilehome parks in the city contain approximately four thousand one hundred 4100 spaces and provide approximately thirty 30 percent of the thirteen thousand eight hundred 13800 dwelling units in the city mobilehome owners unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment to purchase a mobilehome for which they must rent a space in a mobilehome park they have also made investments in maintaining and improving those homes as well as landscaping and exterior improvements to the mobilehomes and the rental spaces on which they are located alternative sites for the relocation of mobilehomes are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces the restrictions on the age size or style of mobilehomes permitted in many parks and requirements related to the installa tion of mobilehomes including permits landscaping and site preparation additionally the cost of moving a mobilehome is substantial and the risk of damage in moving is significant thus moving a mobilehome is not a feasible option if rent becomes excessive the result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market of mobilehome owners and tenants their immobility and the shortage of spaces in turn creates an imbalance in the bargaining relationship between park owners and mobilehome park tenants because mobilehomes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income excessive rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness on  the city council enacted amended this ordinance established a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of space rents in mobilehome parks in the city and limits the rent increases that may be charged by park owners b on  the city council enacted as amended on  by  which prohibits park owners from requiring prospective residents from signing longterm leases as a condition of moving into a mobilehome park c on  the city council enacted which amended amended to allow the deregulation or decontrol of space rents upon specified vacancies of a mobilehome park space and provided for the reimposition of rent control upon the imposition of the rent first charged after such vacancy at the time of the adoption of amended the city council determined that the rent stabilization provisions of amended would provide sufficient protection for park residents against excessive rent increases without the need for control of rents upon vacancies d since the enactment of amended residents of mobilehome parks in the city have presented instances of park owners requiring prospective residents to sign longterm leases as a condition of moving into the park which such longterm leases exempt such persons from the protection of amended in addition residents of mobilehome parks in the city have presented the city with instances of park owners raising rents several fold for new residents as a result these park residents have been unable to sell their coaches and move out of the park and prospective residents have been forced to look for housing elsewhere in some instances park residents have been forced to sell their coaches to the park owner at minimal or no cost such that the coach itself has little or no value and the park owner has assumed the role of landlord on the specific coach as well e as a result of these repeated problems and the unnecessarily oppressive and harsh rent increases which have occurred this city council finds and declares that it is necessary to facilitate and encourage fair bargaining between the prospective residents and park owners as well as current residents and park owners from excessive and unreasonable conditions imposed upon vacancies in mobilehome parks and from unreasonable rent increases in an area of housing shortage the city council finds that control of rents upon vacancy will not prevent park owners from realizing a fair and just return on their property when seen in the context of mobilehome rent control which has been established in the city f in order to facilitate the abovestated policies the city council by adopted provisions limiting the rent that a park owner may charge upon a vacancy in a park amended by provides for complete vacancy control where it is believed that amended and other mobilehome rent control provisions adopted by the city council adequately protect the rights and interest of park owners the ordinance codified in this chapter is intended to apply to any transfer of any mobilehome as well as any change in occupancy of a mobilehome g on  the city council approved the annual

guidelines and the citys environmental guidelines the city has determined that this ordinance is not a project for purposes of ceqa as that term is defined by guidelines specifically this ordinance constitutes organizational or administrative activities of city government that will not result in direct or indirect physical changes in the environment guidelines b5 therefore because it is not a

ceqa applies only to projects that have the potential to cause a significant effect on the environment guidelines b3 as an organizational or administrative activity which do not involve any commitment to any specific project which may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment this ordinance does not have the potential to cause a significant effect on the environment and

filed unless an mnoi application has also been filed and the two applications can be heard together however an application can be filed under subsection a without filing an application under subsection c provides for modifications of the base year net operating income noi used in the mnoi formula under specified circumstances the applicant for a special adjustment under this section shall

the contrary presented pursuant to subsection b of this section that the noi earned by the mobilehome park in calendar year 1987 provided a just and reasonable return to the park except as otherwise provided in subdivision 1 of this subsection park owners shall be entitled to increase the parks 1987 noi by sixtysix and sixtyseven one hundredths 6667 percent of the increase in the cpi since  to  and eighty 80 percent of the increase in the cpi from  to the date of the application in the event that there has been an increase of more than three percent in the vacancy rate in the park since the base year any rent adjustment under this subsection shall be governed by subdivision 1 of this subsection for the purposes of this subsection the 1987 cpi shall be one hundred fourteen and eighty one hundredths 11480 and the current cpi utilized in reviewing a rent increase application shall be the cpi last reported as of the date the application is deemed complete 1 in the event that there has been an increase of more than three percent in the vacancy rate in the park since the base year the city finds that it would be contrary to the purposes of rent stabilization to authorize additional rent increases for occupied spaces in order to offset reductions in income due to increased vacancies which occur because there is not sufficient demand to fill the vacant spaces at the legal rent ceiling in effect allowing additional rent increases for occupied spaces because there are more vacant spaces in a park would allow park owners to obtain higher rents from existing tenants than it is possible to obtain from the prospective tenants whose homes are still mobile and whose options have not been restricted by the process of moving into the park therefore in the event that there has been an increase of more than three percent in the vacancy rate in the park since the base year rent adjustments shall be governed by the following a gross income per rented space shall be computed based on the total gross income of the park divided by the total number of rented spaces the park owner shall be entitled to increase the base year noi per rented space by sixtysix and sixtyseven hundredths 6667 percent of the increase in the cpi since  to  and eighty 80 percent of the increase in the cpi from  b calculations of base year and current year operating expenses may be adjusted by the commission so that a reasonable comparison of the expenses and charges associated with rented spaces is obtained for the purpose of comparing base year and current year operating expenses and to adjust for variations in operating expenses due to the increased vacancy rate 2 in the event a park has received a special adjustment since the base year the income and expense year on which the special adjustment was based shall be deemed the base year for the purposes of evaluating a rent adjustment application and the cpi used as the current cpi in determining the prior special rent adjustment shall be deemed the base year cpi for the purpose of evaluating the special rent adjustment application b rent adjustment based on readjusted base year noi a park owner may rebut the presumption that the parks 1987 noi provided a just and reasonable return at that time by presenting evidence as set forth in the administrative rules adopted by resolution of the city council c fair return rent adjustment a park owner may rebut the presumption that the increased calculations provided in subsection a of this section and modified calculations provided by subsection b of this section are sufficient to provide a just and reasonable return by presenting evidence that the rate of return being earned by the mobilehome park is not just and reasonable as set forth in the administrative rules adopted by resolution of the city council the park owner shall have the burden of proving the park is not earning a just and reasonable return d resident meeting the city

toe of finished slopes over five feet in vertical height the maximum heights of those slopes and approximate total cubic yards of cut and fill shall be shown on the preliminary grading plan d compliance with of the current edition of the uniform building as adopted by the city of yucaipa is required e in the event no such grading is proposed a statement to that effect shall be placed on the required topographic map described in b3a above and this map shall delineate the boundary of an adequately sized building pad driveway and septic system if proposed for each parcel proposed 4 all subdivisions on sites with natural slopes greater than 30% shall be submitted with a conditional use permit for the development of such proposed lots this provision shall not apply if all of the areas on the site with natural ungraded slopes over 30% are permanently restricted from structural development 5 residential density bonuses if any shall only be permitted developments 6 perimeter access to fuel modified and fire hazard areas a standards development projects shall provide for adequate vehicular access for fire fighting vehicles to the development perimeter of the project along the portion of the development perimeter that is adjacent to either an existing or proposed fuel modified area or a fire hazard area provisions shall be made and shall be required where necessary of development project approval for the continual maintenance of the areas intended to provide such access perimeter access shall be provided either of the following two measures or measures pursuant to this i an existing or proposed road along the development perimeter or portion thereof that is exposed to a fire hazard or fuel modified area and which is accessible to fire fighting equipment shall be provided such a road shall be capable of supporting fire fighting equipment shall be at least 20 feet in width and shall not exceed a grade of 14% the conditions of approval for the development project shall require provisions to ensure that the roadway will be maintained if it is not within the publiclymaintained road system ii development projects shall provide accessways at least 12 feet in width with a grade not to exceed 14% and capable of supporting fire fighting vehicles between the development perimeter and proposed or existing streets accessways shall be spaced at intervals of no more than an average of 350 feet along each street the conditions of approval for the development project shall require specific provisions to ensure that accessways will remain unobstructed and will be maintained where feasible accessways may not be paved and shall be designed so as not to detract from the visual quality of the project b intent of standards the intent of the standards described in b6 is to permit fire fighting vehicles to have adequate access into areas between fire hazardous areas or fuel modified areas and the development perimeter so that a wildland fire can be contained at the development perimeter and prevented from spreading to structures an additional intent of these standards is to prevent structural development from becoming a barrier between fire fighting equipment and personnel and the development perimeter c alternate measures pursuant to this dependent upon site specific conditions alternate measures which meet the intent of the standard in b6a above for providing perimeter access to fuel modified and fire hazard areas may be utilized 7 lengths of culdesacs a standard culdesacs shall not exceed 350 feet in length except that they may be extended as allowed by this subsection b exception may be made for parcels of less than five acres in area culdesacs may exceed 350 feet in length but shall not exceed 600 feet in length if one of the following conditions applies i alternate measures shall be utilized pursuant to the provisions of this ii based upon consideration of the recommendation of the fire authority the planning agency determines that the culdesac is situated and designed such that the parcels taking access from it are not contiguous to or exposed to either undeveloped fuel modified areas along the development perimeter of the project or to fire hazard areas and that the extension of the culdesac will not increase the exposure of buildings to wildland fires c exceptions may be granted for parcels greater than five acres in area culdesacs may exceed 600 feet in length if all parcels that take access from the culdesac are five acres or greater in area and the following conditions apply i the proposed culdesac shall not be within or adjacent to areas that are zoned for or subdivided to parcels of five acres or less ii alternate measures shall be utilized pursuant to the provisions of this article d intent of standard the intent of limiting culdesac lengths is to limit the exposure of development and human activity to hazardous fire areas where one rather than two points of access are provided especially when such culdesacs are directly exposed to fire hazard areas the provision of only one point of access increases exposure to fire and inhibits the fighting of wildland fires due to the following factors i if the single access point becomes blocked structures exposed to fire cannot be protected by fire fighting vehicles ii fire fighting vehicles can be trapped on a culdesac if the single access is blocked iii in order for fire fighting vehicles to turn around they usually must travel to the end of the culdesac where adequate room for turning is available iv all vehicles evacuating a culdesac during a fire will be traveling in the opposite direction of fire fighting vehicles moving into a culdesac impeding the ingress of the fire fighting vehicles as well as the egress of the evacuees v development of individual culdesacs which intrude into and are generally surrounded by rugged wildland terrain have greater exposure to wildland fire because the fire may come from several directions at once e alternate measures pursuant to this dependent upon site specific conditions one of the following measures or combinations thereof may be used to mitigate the effect of creating culdesacs up to 600 feet in length with parcels of less than five acres in area i the total number of dwelling units which have access to the culdesac shall be limited to no more than 15 and the further subdivision of parcels and construction of additional independent residential units which have access to the culdesac shall be restricted such restrictions shall be imposed conditions of approval of the development project ii a continuous perimeter access road at least 20 feet in width shall be provided along the portion of the culdesac exposed to fire hazard or fuel modified areas such that it is driveable under normal conditions by fire fighting vehicles provides adequate maneuvering space for such vehicles and is designed such that at least one point of access to the perimeter access road is taken from roads other than the culdesac in question iii the culdesac road shall have a paved width of at least 40 feet with posted no parking for its entire length there shall be at least one area approximately at the midpoint of the culdesac that serves the same function of a culdesac bulb in allowing fire fighting vehicles adequate room to turn around this measure may only be utilized if the expansion of the road width will not contribute to slope stability hazards either on or offsite iv other alternate measures may be approved by the planning agency pursuant to this article  alternate hazard protection measures a applicability the following provisions shall apply only to the standards and requirements of subsections b regarding building separations b6 regarding perimeter access and b7 regarding the length of culdesacs b intent the intent of this subsection is to allow greater design flexibility than would otherwise be permitted in order to provide a more efficient and effective achievement of the purposes of the fire safety fr overlay district design flexibility is provided by allowing the substitution of alternate measures for the established standards or requirements if it is found that they provide the same or a greater level of protection from wildland fires and other natural hazards and that they will fulfill the same purpose as the established standard or requirement c substitution of alternative measures for standards and requirements 1 if alternative measures are proposed the fire authority shall determine with specific consideration of the effect of the proposed alternative measures whether the proposed development project has adequate provisions for fuel modification and management including the ongoing maintenance of fuel modified areas 2 if the fire authority makes a positive determination pursuant to subsection c1 of this then alternate measures may be substituted for the established standards and requirements if the planning agency with consideration of the recommendation of the fire authority finds and justifies all of the following a alternative measures have been substituted which meet the intent of and which serve the same purpose as the established standard or requirement b the alternative measures that have been substituted provide the same or a greater level of protection or are as effective as the established standard or requirement c there are clear and substantial reasons for utilizing the alternative measures because they provide for a more efficient and economic use of the site or provide for a superior physical design and are consistent with the intent of the fire safety fr overlay district article 2 floodplain safety fp overlay district  intent the floodplain safety overlay district is established to provide greater public safety promote public health and minimize public and private economic losses due to flood conditions by establishing regulations for

section c the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or a state inventory of historic places shall be exempt from the requirements and standards established by this section d replacement of utilities including septic systems in compliance with health and safety codes shall be exempt from the flood elevation requirements of this shall otherwise be subject to the legal nonconforming use provisions of this added by  2006  variance procedure a the variance criteria set forth in this section of the based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or to the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the floodplain safety overlay district are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b in passing upon requests for variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this the following 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands and injure others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the general plan and floodplain management program for

categories have been classified in terms of landform types with respect to different slope categories as follows slope landform type 0  6% flat 61  15% gentle rolling land 151  20% hillside 201  30% steep hillside 301  40% mountainous 401% + rugged mountain b slopes of 06% are essentially flat land normally posing no major restrictions to development except in terms of landscaping and maintenance for the small amounts of slopes created slopes of 6115% are not suitable for freeways and major arterials but flexible as to local road orientation and site layout there are generally no significant constraints associated with this category but it is more restrictive than flat land development in areas with slopes of 151% and above shall require hillside development review hillsides of 15120% slope are significantly affected in terms of read alignment in that roads will normally be required to parallel contours more significant grading is required to create flat pad areas and the orientation of site planning such as orienting pads parallel to contours to avoid significant side splits or a saw tooth effect on graded pads begins to be restricted in terms of access and the ability to grade flat sites in steep hillside areas of 20130% slope the required quantities of earthwork necessary for grading to create flat pads increases dramatically as does the significance of view opportunities and visual prominence in mountainous areas with slopes of 30140% both access and the ability to create pads using  slopes are severely restricted flat areas and roads are difficult to create making access a problem in rugged mountain areas with slopes of 401% or greater development is prohibited without the use of retaining walls access is very difficult and the grading of pads on side slopes of 401% or greater is virtually impossible without massive grading that would involve cutting hilltop areas and filling the valleys amended by  2011  ridgeline preservation a any tentative parcel map or tentative tract map in the vicinity of or affecting ridgeline areas shall be required to perform a view analysis depicting before and after conditions views from a minimum of three 3 selected vantage points showing a precise depiction of the potential visual impacts of the proposal shall be presented to the planning commission the technology may incorporate the use of a

contour interval l   contour length    constant to convert square feet to acres and slope to percent a   acres in site b where there is a dramatically different landform character in the topography of any one site the site may be divided into several distinct areas and average slope calculated separately at the discretion of the community development director  design criteria a the slope and natural open space relationship below is used to determine natural open space dedication requirements for development projects based on the slope of the land one column defines the percentages of slope within a project that are to be categorized the other column indicates the proportion of each slope category that must be left as natural open space slope category % minimum percent of open space left natural 0  15 0 151  20 50 201  25 60 251  30 70 301  35 80 351  40 90 401 + 100 b the relationship is designed so that as the steepness of the land increases the open space requirement increases this encourages development on rugged environmentally sensitive terrain to be concentrated or intensified in the most appropriate areas of the site it does not necessarily however prohibit development on steep slopes nor does it necessarily reduce the permitted density c other public health safety or welfare considerations could also increase the open space requirements for a project d the method of calculating the percent slope of any piece of land involves plotting the land on a topographic base map and dividing the vertical rise between contours by the horizontal distance between the same contours multiplied by 100 a slope map shall be prepared and submitted with any residential development application the slope map shall include the following information 1 a topographic map of the proposed project area and all adjoining properties within 150 feet at a scale of not less than one 1 inch to two hundred 200 feet the contour interval shall be not more than two 2 feet except

nearvertical walls shall not be included in the slope calculations for the purpose of tabulating the cumulative acreage of each slope category e the amount of land to be left in natural open space for any given project is computed by multiplying the number of acres of the project area within each slope category by the required percentage of natural open space for that category the totals for each category are then summed to yield the total natural open space requirement for the project amended by  2011   5 2007  earth workland forms a building pads in hillside areas shall have a minimum

new or additional removal permits shall be satisfied to the permittee for a period of one year from the date of conviction chapter 2 tree protection from insects and diseases  purpose the city finds that there is a serious danger to the trees in this city from coniferous trees which are cut in land clearing operations and are then allowed to remain exposed and untreated when coniferous slash material is left untreated against noxious insects the insects could multiply in such felled trees to later attack and damage the healthy coniferous trees of this city it is in the public interest to establish standards for the proper treatment and disposition of felled trees to protect against damaging insects eg bark beetles and diseases  disposition of coniferous trees every person firm or corporation whether as principal agent or employee which has control of or right of entry or of access to any land in the area described in shall comply with the provisions of this chapter except as

coniferous trees or portions thereof are treated in accordance with the provisions of this section the building official or the city planner shall require a permittee to obtain where necessary a certificate from the local fire authority or appropriately certified pest control adviser or a qualified applicator that compliance with any measures that are not readily observable by the inspector on the construction site has been made in an acceptable manner felled coniferous trees shall be treated by at least one or a combination of the following measures a remove to a solid waste disposal site specifically designated by the city for such use b burn sufficiently to consume the bark when allowed by local fire protection agency and air pollution control district c lop and scatter material less than four inches in diameter so that it is piled no higher than 24 inches above the ground when allowed by the local fire protection agency d remove the bark e chip or grind f split and scatter with bark toward the sun for a minimum of 45 consecutive days or until final inspection is completed whichever is less g stack in the sun and cover with six mil clear plastic which has a continuous seal from the outside for at least 180 days h spray with a commercial insecticide for such purposes as approved by the city planner for such insects and purposes i treat under any other method approved by the enforcement officer in writing  stump treatment any freshcut stumps of any live coniferous trees shall be protected from infection by annosus root rot fomes annosus with borax powder granular tech 10 mole as soon as possible after felling covering the entire newlyexposed cut andor broken surface completely with a thin uniform layer of white borax within two hours  extension of time of enforcement if any of the land governed by this chapter is subject to snow or flooding which renders compliance with the provisions of the specified time periods impractical because of inaccessibility to the cut timber an enforcement officer may extend the period of time for compliance chapter 3 mountain forest and valley tree conservation  purpose additionally the city finds that it is in the public interest in the valley area to provide for the conservation and wise use of our tree resources regulations guidelines and enforcement it is also the purpose of this chapter to augment and coordinate with the state department of forestry and fire protections efforts to properly implement the mandates of the state forest practice act of 197 as amended  scope a private tree

subject to the provisions of this division regarding trees chapter 4 riparian plant conservation  purpose the city finds that it is in the public interest to promote healthy and abundant riparian habitats riparian habitats are located along the sides of canyon bottoms streams and rivers providing watershed protection as well as control transmission and storage of natural water supplies riparian areas provide a unique wildlife habitat and contribute to an attractive environment rare endangered and threatened plants and animals are most often found in riparian areas riparian areas also provide natural soil erosion and sedimentation control protecting stream banks subject to erosion and undercutting in addition riparian areas provide sufficient shade to reduce temperature and evaporation and the growth of algae in streams the provisions of this chapter are designed to augment and coordinate with the responsibilities of the california department of fish and game  scope a
