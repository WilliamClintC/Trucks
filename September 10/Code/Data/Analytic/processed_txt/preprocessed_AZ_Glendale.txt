that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  8 to insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  and 9 to maintain eligibility for state disaster relief b in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction

variances  appeals a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city of glendale to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate c administrative appeals board 1 the administrative appeals board of the city of glendale shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance 2 the administrative appeals board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance 3 in passing upon such applications the administrative appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges 4 upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this ordinance the administrative appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and c the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by ars  26301 et seq as amended a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the maricopa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to federal emergency management agency d conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided the procedures of articles ii and iii of this ordinance have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  c showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in of this ordinance in the definition of functionally dependent use  and d determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e any variance granted must be recommended to and approved by the city council acting as the floodplain board res no 474  2exh a 111313 secs 17301740  reserved

449  1 61411 sexually oriented businesses article i  in general findings a the city council makes the following findings based on evidence concerning the secondary effects of sexually oriented adult businesses on the community presented in reports made available to the city council 1 adult businesses cause secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare and which are set forth in more detail in subsections a2 a12 of this section 2 adult businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities and are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including public sexual indecency and prostitution and sexual encounters of a casual nature 3 adult businesses which feature live performances or activities involving nude or seminude persons including adult cabarets escort bureaus nude model studios seminude businesses and topless bars lend themselves to unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently largely uncontrolled by the operators of such businesses and such businesses require special supervision from public safety agencies 4 sexual acts and other sexual contact occur at businesses which allow live performances featuring nude or seminude entertainers such acts result from the inability or unwillingness of the operators to control sexual activity andor the physical layout of such businesses which generally permits oneonone performances by entertainers whose activities are difficult for the operators to monitor sexual acts are especially likely at adult businesses which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or rooms for viewing live performances and offering and providing such areas encourages sexual activities 5 the operating characteristics of adult businesses raise substantial government concerns including health concerns over the spread of sexually transmitted and possibly fatal diseases and should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 6 adult businesses require minimum standards and regulations to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare 7 establishing regulations on the place and manner of activities in adult businesses by limiting live performances to locations open to public viewing and by minimizing contact between employees and patrons will serve as a deterrent to and help curb the illegal sexual activity and other casual sexual conduct occurring in adult businesses 8 establishing a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the operators and managers of adult businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on operators and managers to see that adult businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensees are the actual operators and managers of the adult business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the regulation of nudity and seminudity and manner of entertainment in adult businesses will further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex related crimes including illegal sex acts and in protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring visibility sufficient lighting and monitoring of patron activities in adult businesses will advance the substantial governmental interests in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and adult theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of adult businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate manage or be employed in an adult business barring such persons from the operation and management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five 5 years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases b in making the findings set forth in subsection a of this section the city council has relied upon the adult business factual record and studies which are on file with the tax and license division of the finance department  51199 purpose it is the city councils intent in adopting this chapter to regulate adult businesses in a manner necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the public and of employees and patrons of such businesses  to reduce the incidence of criminal behavior
