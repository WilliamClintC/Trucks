wireless communication services and the need to accommodate facilities that provide such services b the city of cody desires to protect the communitys visual quality and safety while facilitating the reasonable and balanced provision of wireless communication services more specifically it is the citys goal to minimize the visual impact of wireless communication facilities on the community particularly in rightsofway and residential zones c the quality and variety of the scenic viewsheds that are available to the residents and visitors to the area are irreplaceable and warrant protection from unnecessary visual pollution the city of cody encourages providers to maximize the use of options that conceal the components of wireless communication facilities ie stealth design wherever feasible d the natural landforms within and around the city of cody provide a unique opportunity for the location and design of wireless communication facilities such that design engineers can utilize those natural features and topographic elevation differences in combination with the built environment to both minimize visual impacts and maximize coverage historically almost all current providers in the area have relied on a primary tower on carter mountain in the county because such location provides coverage not only to the city but to areas west of the mountain as well coverage and capacity is improved facilities dispersed throughout the cody area where fiber optic and power services are existing or readily available with lte and lteadvanced technology being implemented more facilities serving smaller service areas will be needed the locations and designs of those facilities must be sensitive to the cody community e the size and configuration of the city of cody is such that a network of tall towers is unnecessary to provide quality coverage to its residents and visitors the city prefers that the local network system of wireless communication facilities be of a dispersed design  eg using two 2 or more smaller facilities instead of one 1 larger tower f if modifications to these regulations are needed to accommodate the seemingly everchanging provisions of fcc rules and regulations the context of such consideration shall be as an amendment to this title as opposed to a special exemption or variance g the city desires to provide regulations which are specifically not intended to and shall not be interpreted or applied to 1 prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services 2 unreasonably discriminate among functionally

description athe planned unit development pud is intended to provide a mechanism for land development overall unified approach rather than the traditional lot by lot approach this option encourages innovative approaches to land development by means of flexibility in design and land utilization in order to create an improved living environment preserve the unique features of the site and provide services in a more efficient manner unlike standard zoning classifications the pud allows for a variety of types of residential andor commercial development and encourages appropriate mixes of residential product types ba pud is developed as a single entity under a plan which may provide a variety of land uses housing types and densities and which provides design characteristics in addition to those ordinarily allowed by right or condition in the zoning district in which it is located it is intended that each pud will be a separate development having differing design characteristics for the uses and improvements based upon a particular site situation  1172 intent the intent of the planned unit development in the city is ato encourage flexibility innovation of design and variety of development types in order to promote the most suitable use of a site and so that greater opportunities for housing recreation shopping and employment may extend to all citizens of the city bto

relationship with the surrounding area eto preserve the unique natural scenic historical and cultural features of the site fto develop and preserve usable common areas gto beautify and improve the quality of life in the city and to ensure compliance with the city subdivision regulations and the city zoning ordinance hto encourage a high quality of design ito encourage the conservation of energy jto promote and encourage affordable housing kto avoid construction in unsuitable areas lto encourage creativity in design including flexibility in residential siting to achieve energy conservation mto provide for a mix of land uses where enough land area is present to design an integrated neighborhood consisting not only of various types and densities of residences but to include appropriate neighborhood related nonresidential uses nto protect existing neighborhoods from the harmful encroachment of newer incompatible development by allowing redevelopment of existing sites or infill of vacant property within developed areas of a design plan the design plan could reduce setbacks and other requirements to allow new residential or commercial development that matches the character of the surrounding existing neighborhood oto encourage patterns of development that decreases automobile travel and thereby reduces traffic congestion pto promote development patterns of residential

applicability 1183 variances to typical subdivision design standards 1184 residential infill subdivision design standards 1185 other requirements 1181 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish appropriate subdivision development standards for the infill and redevelopment of underutilized residential properties so as to allow additional housing opportunities on individual lots in existing neighborhoods to help minimize development costs and thereby encourage more affordable housing this chapter is intended to be utilized as a template for qualifying developments without the need for complete engineered plans  relying instead on the standards herein and qualified contractors and tradesmen to complete the subdivision improvements to acceptable standards therefore the scope of this chapter is limited to projects that are relatively straightforward and do not involve construction of any new public streets public water lines or public sewer lines the maximum size limit for applicability of this chapter is meant to separate small infill situations from larger properties that are more appropriately developed with traditional development patterns and improvements  1182

variance increases 7conditions of variance upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter 8designated floodways variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 9repair of historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 10prerequisites for granting variances avariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief bvariances shall only be issued upon 1showing a good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances cany application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
