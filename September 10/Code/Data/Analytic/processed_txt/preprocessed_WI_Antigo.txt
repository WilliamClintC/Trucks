tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity to disrupt the peace and order of the communities to depreciate the value of real property to harm the economic welfare of the

council recognizes the us supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently

the following a the potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses  b the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist  c health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and d the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct  8 the common council desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight  and 9 the common council has determined that enactment of this section prohibiting live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages promotes the goal of minimizing preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity d prohibited it is unlawful for any person to perform or engage in or for any licensee or manager or agent of the licensee to
