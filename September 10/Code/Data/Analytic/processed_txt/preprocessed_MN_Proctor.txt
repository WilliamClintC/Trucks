nutrification soil erosion and sedimentation and water quality degradation as a result of these influences there is a loss of plant species such as reed canary grass and reduction in wildlife habitat 2 wetlands natural natural wetlands are still in their natural state and typically show little sign of impact from surrounding land usage the vegetative community of these wetlands are characterized by a diversity of plant species with mixed dominance of species other key factors include presence of natural indicator species good wildlife habitat and being aesthetically pleasing 3 wetlands pristine wetlands that exist in a natural state and have special and unusual qualities worth protecting at a high level are call pristine these qualities 194 include rare or unusual species present and habitat for rare wildlife species 4 utilized utilized water bodies created for the specific purpose of surface water runoff retention andor water quality improvements these water bodies are not to be classified as wetlands even if they take on wetland characteristics wetland alteration permits shall not be required to undertake work on these water bodies subd 4 no net loss to achieve no net loss of wetland except as provided elsewhere in this authorized by a wetland alteration permit issued by the city a person may not drain grade fill burn remove healthy native vegetation or otherwise alter or destroy a wetland of any size or type any alteration to a wetland permitted by a wetland alteration permit will be fully mitigated so that there is no net loss of wetlands subd 5 standards the following standards apply to all lands within and abutting a wetland 1 septic and soil absorption system must be a setback minimum of one hundred fifty 150 feet from the ordinary high water mark of the wetland 2 the lowest ground floor elevation is three 3 feet above ordinary high water mark of the wetland 3 docks or walkways shall be elevated six 6 to eight 8 inches above the ordinary high

6 wetland alteration an applicant for a wetland alteration permit shall adhere to the following principals in descending order of priority 1 avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland  2 minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its implementation  3 rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected wetland environment  4 reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance 195 operations during the life of the activity  and 5 compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or environments a wetland alteration permit shall not be issued unless the proposed development complies with the provisions of the mitigation this well as the standards intent and purpose of this the city determines that the required calculations in a particular instance are needlessly burdensome because of the area and nature of a proposal it may agree to a substitute analysis subd 7 permit required drainage grading filling burning removal of healthy native vegetation or otherwise altering or destroying a wetland of any size

with the requirements of this the activity results in a loss of functional wetland dredging to create water quality improvement basins may be allowed by the city where reasonable alternatives are not available or where the wetland is of low quality and designed for this purpose by the proctor flood plain  storm water runoff when a wetland alteration permit is issued allowing storm water runoff to discharge directly into a wetland the following standards shall be followed 1 an increase over the natural volume of storm water runoff from a development may be allowed when necessary for use of property but only when it will not 197 have a net adverse effect upon the ecological and hydrological characteristics of the existing wetlands the restrictions on runoff set out below shall not be exceeded since the total increase in runoff which can be permitted is limited the city when considering wetland alteration permit applications shall consider in addition to the following apportionment of increased runoff opportunity to all wetland property within the surrounding wetland area 2 storm water runoff from a development may be directed to the wetland only when free of debris and substantially free of chemical pollutants and silt and only at rates which do not disturb vegetation habitat or increase turbidity sheet flow and other overland drainage of runoff shall be encouraged 3 the allowed total increased runoff in combination with the total fill allowed shall not cause total natural flood storage or nutrient stripping capacity of the wetland to be reduced in a manner inconsistent with requirements established by the proctor flood plain  mitigation a mitigation intent where wetland alteration is approved and mitigation is required mitigation must result in an improvement to the wetland function and value of the replacement property mitigation plans must address water quality and improvement and maintenance of preexisting hydrological balance and wildlife habitat the wetland function and value will include improvement of water quality maintaining hydrological balance and provision of wildlife habitat mitigation will be performed at ratios required by state law to achieve replacement of the wetland function and value mitigation will not always be based solely on an acre to acre replacement but may be based on replacement of habitat units hu use of habitat evaluation procedures when significant improvements in the wetland value and function result acre for acre surface area replacement may not be required b mitigation standards mitigation of wetlands for function and value should be restored created and enhanced to have the following characteristics 1 relatively stable water levels subject to natural fluctuations 2 pretreatment of inflow
