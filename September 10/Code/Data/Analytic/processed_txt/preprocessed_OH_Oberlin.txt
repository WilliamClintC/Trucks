three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  building thirteen  planning and zoning fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law

businesses within the city in order to promote the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication including sexually oriented entertainment similarly it is not the purpose or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the first amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market furthermore it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene bfindings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before the council  on findings incorporated in the cases of the city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us

austin texas  and phoenix arizona  along with manatee county florida  new hanover county north carolina  and the state of minnesota  this council finds 1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities 2sexual acts including masturbation and oral sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexuallyoriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities 5numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 6the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 5 raise substantial governmental concerns 7sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 8a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretoforenonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9the regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex related crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare 10removal of doors curtains partitions drapes or any other obstruction whatsoever that would be capable of wholly or partially obscuring the view from outside a viewing booth of any person inside a viewing booth in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 13a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business or adult motel 14barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases ac passed
