services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose the purpose of this section is to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area    90448 d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this section uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands e definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this section shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common

the rational method and the unit hydrograph method the rational method may be used for drainage areas less than or equal to 200 acres drainage basins that exceed 200 acres must use the unit hydrograph method the soil conservation service technical release number 55 is an acceptable unit hydrograph method when the rational method is used and detention is required the volume of water supplied by the design storm may be calculated by converting the runoff rate during a specific duration to volume the inflow volume should be determined for a period of at least twice the time of concentration for

sexuallyoriented establishments a local government state of texas authorizes home rule cities to license any lawful business occupation or calling that is susceptible to the control of the police power b local government authorizes home rule cities to enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health life and property and to preserve the good government order and security of such cities and their inhabitants c local government authorizes cities regulate sexuallyoriented businesses d the city council finds that sexuallyoriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature e the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens    127448 f licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexuallyoriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation g there is convincing documented evidence that sexuallyoriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values h it is recognized that sexuallyoriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent areas i the city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods deter the spread of urban blight protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life and protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry j that the secondary effects precipitated by establishment of a sexually oriented business can be substantially mitigated by requiring separation of the sexually oriented business from residential uses and places of public assembly and from one another 2 the city council makes the following findings with regard to the licensing of sexuallyoriented establishments a the city council believes it is in the interest of the public safety and welfare to prohibit persons convicted of certain crimes defined below as specified criminal offenses from engaging in the occupation of operating a sexuallyoriented business b the city council in accordance with article 625213c of the revised civil statutes of texas has considered the following criteria i the nature and seriousness of the crime  ii the relationship of the crime to the purposes for requiring a license to engage in the occupation  iii the extent to which a license might offer an opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person previously had been involved  and iv the relationship of the crime to the ability capacity or fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the licensed occupation c the city council has determined that the specified criminal offenses as set forth below are serious crimes which are directly related to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation of operating a sexuallyoriented business d the city council has determined that the very nature of the occupation of operating a sexuallyoriented business brings a person into constant contact with persons interested in sexuallyoriented materials and activities thereby giving the person repeated opportunities to commit offenses against public order and decency or crimes against the public health safety or morals should he or she be so inclined thus the city council is of the opinion that conviction of a specified criminal offense renders a person unable incompetent and unfit to perform the duties and responsibilities accompanying the operation of a sexuallyoriented business in a manner that would promote the public safety and trust 3 the city council has determined that no person who has been convicted of a specified criminal offense as set forth below is presently fit to operate a sexuallyoriented business until the respective time periods designated in that section have expired 4 it is the intent of the city council to disqualify a person from being issued a sexuallyoriented business license by the city of sachse if he or she is currently under indictment or misdemeanor information for or has been convicted within the designated time period of any specified criminal offense 5 pursuant to the provisions of section  2 local government the city council finds that generally the operation of a sexuallyoriented business within 1000 feet of the following uses is inconsistent with such uses a churches or similar places of regular religious worship  b public or private elementary or secondary schools  c boundaries of residential districts as defined by the sachse zoning map  d public parks adjacent to residential districts as defined by the sachse zoning map  e property lines of lots devoted to
