authority and purpose a the city council finds and declares that there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for violations of this code and that an appropriate method of enforcement is an administrative citation program b the council additionally finds that it is in the publics interest to streamline enforcement of violations of city laws by providing for administrative citations this is so because the issuance of an administrative citation provides for a quick resolution of uncontested violations but continues to give persons who have been issued citations a hearing before a neutral party c pursuant to article xi section 7 of the california constitution the city has the authority to make and enforce within its jurisdictional limits all laws for the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of reedley which are not in conflict with general state laws in addition california government specifically provides that the city may impose civil fines penalties and forfeitures up to a maximum of one thousand dollars $100000 for violations of city ordinances further california government 4 expressly authorizes the city to establish an administrative citation program for violations of city ordinances d the council further finds that certain violations of this code may be of such a nature or the administrative citation may be ineffective in ensuring compliance with this code that existing enforcement mechanisms may have to be utilized these methods include but are not necessarily limited to the use of a criminal citation or complaint abatement or civil injunction therefore nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude the citys use of alternative code enforcement methods  1122 definitions  sterling codifiers inc  20391 for purposes of this

located in any center median of a public road or in a sidewalk rightofway  and directional arrows with addresses not exceeding six 6 in number in the neighborhood of sales in adopting this exemption for offsite residential open house signs the council finds as follows a the city has a compelling interest to exempt certain signs to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter and to allow for the use of signs with minimal aesthetic impact because of their size and temporary nature b the singlefamily residential real estate industry is distinct from other industries in that there are generally no storefronts available for advertising and most homes are not located adjacent to heavily traveled streets this makes offsite signs that advertise available homes necessary for potential buyers to find them c real estate signs do not advertise goods or services but actual locations directing potential buyers to an available home is necessary to facilitate real estate transactions as potential buyers must be able to find and view the available homes d singlefamily real estate sales are temporary and infrequent as opposed to sales from commercial businesses exempting singlefamily open house real estate signs will not lead to a proliferation of unsightly signs because they will be used only during very limited times when there is an open house will be removed at the end of each day of use and once a home is sold will no longer be used e exempting offsite open house real estate signs is necessary to allow homeowners to efficiently advertise and sell their properties as quickly as possible and to assist potential buyers in finding available homes within our community  101411 nonconforming signs the lawful use of a sign existing on the effective date of this chapter

welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  1212 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in

procedures  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare a appeal board 1 the city council shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the city that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration of the federal emergency management agency b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of sections 1214 and 1215 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases  sterling codifiers inc  389391 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of an historic structure as defined in section 1212 of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 5 variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in section 1212 of this chapter to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense  create a nuisance1 cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in section 1212 of this chapter or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections b1 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of subsection a5 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  storm drainage systems 1221 definitions for the purpose of
