subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increased in flood heights and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage passed 071607  15103 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocity  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands passed 071607  15104 objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2008s1 flood damage prevention 11 2 minimize expenditure of public money

forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property which physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council of elizabethtown kentucky to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 2 designation of variance and appeal board a the city council of elizabethtown kentucky shall establish an appeal board consisting of the city engineer director of planning & development the executive assistant to the mayor and one designated member of the city council 3 duties of variance and appeals board a the appeals board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of

applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  e necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  f availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges 5 conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter a variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council of elizabethtown kentucky need to grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council of elizabethtown kentucky believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance c variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure d variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation f the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request g variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 2008s1 24l elizabethtown  land usage 6 variance notification any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and  b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county clerk of hardin county and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variances actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency 7 historic structures variances may be issued

environmentally sensitive areas and geologic hazard areas it is recognized that certain areas in elizabethtown due to environmental or geologic conditions may pose problems providing safe development where such conditions are encountered on the land to be developed these areas are defined and described as follows  environmentally sensitive area this term applies to any area which due to its natural or physical setting may have environmental problems with regard to their development this is not to say that the land cannot be developed but if it is determined that development can occur then some safeguards such as detailed site planning will be necessary to overcome the physical limitation of the land lands in question shall include but not be limited to areas of poor soils improper fill wetlands significant areas of tree stands aquifer recharge areas wellhead protection areas riparian areas streams creeks lakes and other natural waterways  geologic hazard areas a geologic hazard area differs from an environmentally sensitive area in that the environmental problems are so numerous that development even with severe limitations would pose a severe problem to the immediate area or the surrounding areas examples of these areas are areas of excessive floodplain areas that have clustering of sinkholes areas of severe slope over 20% and areas that have potential collapse problems due to caves underneath the rock strata but close to the surface location of most of the environmentally sensitive and geologic hazard areas are shown in the hardin county soil survey prepared by the u s soil conservation service additional maps and other information regarding such areas are on file with the city  procedures the developer shall submit the following materials to the department for any development involving an environmentally sensitive or geologic hazard area an application containing a general statement of development activity and mitigation plans  a development plan or subdivision plat as required by the zoning which shall locate and identify such areas additionally the following materials may be required after initial review by the department engineering studies of sub surface conditions erosion and sedimentation control plans drainage plans soil analysis or grading plans  standards whenever a development is proposed on land containing such areas the following requirements shall apply environmentally sensitive areas all such areas shall be protected by special design measures taken by the developer to attempt to minimize the developments impact acceptable design measures are  non disturbance of area   provisions of additional building setbacks at a minimum a 50 foot setback so that site disturbance is minimal   provision of easements in such areas as may be appropriate so that an open space area is provided   provision of storm water retention areas   recontouring and excavation of the area only when an erosion control plan is approved by the storm water management department and when appropriate performance surety has been posted with the city geologic hazard areas all such areas shall be protected by generously designing the development such that a geologic hazard area shall be left in its natural state as a permanent open space for a distance of 100 feet from such areas  commission review after review of the applications general statement and applicable plans if the department finds that questions remain concerning the developments impact on the environmentally sensitive area or the health and safety of future users of the area the plan will be referred to the commission for action the commission shall refuse to fully approve a plan or plat until it is satisfied that the hazards have been eliminated or adequate safeguards have been provided to ensure the least negative impact on the area 95 public facilities  water supply system every development shall be provided with a complete water distribution system

installation contained within the zoning filing an application for sidewalk installation waiver with the commission a request for a waiverdelay may be made for any permitted use in any zone if waivers have been granted previously on a parcel on the same street within 250 feet  of the site the staff may grant the waiver administratively should the waiver not be granted administratively an application may still be filed with the commission as set out in the previous paragraph3 4 waiver process as part of the waiver request the applicant shall have the burden of proof in showing that there will be no adverse impact upon the neighborhood or general area by the granting of the waiver in granting a waiver the planning commission shall consider the following 1 the special circumstances of the proposed use  and 2 site constraints that would make the installation economically unfeasible  and 3 the absence of a sidewalk network in the general vicinity and remote prospects for installation of a sidewalk network in the near future  and 4 whether the installation of sidewalks would serve the purpose of enhancing the public welfare  and3 the commission may also consider other factors it may deem relevant in making its decision a waiver of the requirement for sidewalk installation does not exempt the development from any other requirements of the zoning delayed installation as part of a waiverdelay request the commission may determine that it is in the communitys best interest to delay the installation of the sidewalks instead of waiving the requirement in granting a delay the commission shall consider the following 1 any proposed or planned public improvement project that would affect the design and location of the sidewalk on the property and  2 the desirability of a sidewalk network in the near future and probability for the installation of a sidewalk network and  3 whether the delay of installation of sidewalks would better serve the purpose of enhancing public welfare the commission may also consider other factors it may deem relevant in making its decision in these instances the commission may release the applicant from the requirement for sidewalk installation at the time of the applicants request by allowing the applicant to pay to the city the cost for installation the cost of installation shall be determined by the city engineer the city shall hold these funds and use them to install such sidewalks when it deems appropriate a waiverdelay of the requirement for sidewalk installation does not exempt the development from any other

the subdivision of a lot which has two 2 or more legally constructed principal structures into separate parcels for the purpose of the sale or transfer of the individual structures if the commission finds that the properties have been used in a separate and distinct manner with separate utilities and other facilities so that the resulting resubdivision will not constitute a material change in use of the property 2 notwithstanding any portion of the zoning a nonconforming lot may be used for construction of any otherwise lawfully permitted structure in a zone in which the lot is located such a nonconforming lot must be in separate ownership and not in contiguous frontage with other lots in the same ownership 3 if two 2 or more lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership and if any of the lots have less than fifty 50 feet of street frontage the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel no subdivision or consolidation in whole or in part with another lot shall

provide for vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties and which may also provide space for drainage ways and the location of underor aboveground utilities streets are classified by function as follows 1 arterial street  the streets and highways that serve major centers of activity arterials have the highest traffic volumes speed limit and rightofway width arterial streets may be further divided into two classes a principal arterials  principal arterials carry the major portion of trips entering and leaving the community as well as the majority of desiring to bypass the city for principal arterials the concept of service to abutting land should be subordinate to the provision of travel service for major traffic movements generally principal arterials are state maintained roads b minor arterials  minor arterial streets interconnect with and augment principal arterials and provide service trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of travel mobility this system includes all arterials not classified as principal arterial streets and includes facilities that place more emphasis on land access than the principal system and offers a lower level of traffic mobility 2 collector street  a street which conducts traffic entirely development and connects the development to existing and future subdivisions there are two types of collectors as follows a commercial collector  a collector street which primarily serves commercial and industrial development this class of streets is intended to accommodate the business access needs of commercial and industrial areas which have a variety of vehicle types and require a higher design level roadways in this classification may require wider lanes and travel clearances parking should generally be prohibited to maintain adequate visibility and operating level of service2 17 subdivision regulations design and improvement standards b residential collector  a collector street which primarily serves residential development roadways within this classification are intended to convey traffic within a neighborhood to an adjoining collector or arterial street residential collectors are not intended to carry should therefore be designed to discourage nonlocal traffic functions parking should be prohibited for this classification except in cases where parking may be permitted if streets are wide enough to provide for safe traffic movement and high levels of service except near the approaches of intersections3 3 local street  a street which provides access to the various lots which are not served by other streets and which are of minimum width and design containing certain safety features for the adjoining property vehicles moving on these streets should have an origin or destination in the immediate vicinity 4 culdesac street  a type of local street that begins at an intersection with another street and deadends with an appropriate turnaround facility at the end54 u subdivision the division of land into two 2 or more lots or parcels for the purpose whether immediate or future of sale lease or building development or if a new street is involved any division of a parcel of land provided that a division of land for agricultural use and not involving a new street shall not be deemed a subdivision the term includes resubdivision and when appropriate to the

opportunity to propose alternative buffer standards andor storm water best management practices for site development in urban core areas of the city of elizabethtown the rsbp will be evaluated by staff to determine if proposed buffers and storm water practices will accomplish the goal of improved quality of storm water discharge to regulatory streams the rsbp shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission prior to staff approval of a development plan amendments to a floodwaydrainage easement shall not be considered as part of a rsbp associated with a development plan such amendments shall only be considered as a revision to the subdivision plat containing the original easement dedication b a rsbp plan submittal shall consist of a site development plan consistent with the citys submittal requirements  a text and graphic description of the proposed riparian buffers building setbacks and storm water management practices to be implemented the plan must demonstrate no direct discharge of the water quality portion of storm water to the regulatory stream  an equivalent level of treatment of the first inch of storm water runoff to that provided by a 25 foot wide riparian buffer with associated treatment practices  and building setbacksdevelopment restrictions that ensure that future site development will not adversely impact the regulatory stream and floodway c the purpose of the rsbp process is to recognize that urban core area development parcels and lots may not be sized or configured to permit full development of the site and accomplish the preservationprovision of minimum riparian buffers that provide water quality treatment of storm water runoff in such cases the rsbp provides a process to develop and implement an equivalent water quality treatment plan based on the alternative riparian buffers and water quality best management practices such as the use of pervious pavement in parking areas and driveways underground storm water retention facilities rain gardens and tree wells and other similar low impact development practices 4 maintenance options for floodway easements with riparian buffers the property owner is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of lands and storm water improvements within a floodway easement and streamside riparian buffers unless an alternate maintenance and land purchase agreement is approved by the elizabethtown city council 423 subdivision regulations design and improvement standards 5 conformance with the requirements and standards described above does not relieve the property
