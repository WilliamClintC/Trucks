interconnect with and augment the principal arterial system minor arterials distribute traffic to smaller geographic areas providing service between and within communities c collector roads collectors provide land access service and traffic circulation within residential commercial and industrial areas the collector system distributes trips from the arterials area to the ultimate destination

highways which provide interregional connections e local roads are streets that transport general residential traffic they do not carry the same volumes that are recorded on higherlevel streets these roads should be safe for pedestrians these roads connect to collectors to provide access to other areas of the town and then further to arterials and further to limited access highways f service roads
