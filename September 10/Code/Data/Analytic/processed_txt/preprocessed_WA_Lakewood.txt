engineering regulations and standards to implement the comprehensive plan  streets  street classification and plan streets and highways are most effectively classified by their function according to the character of service they are intended to provide the primary function of streets and highways is to provide mobility and access and the degree to which these functions are provided is considered an integral part of classifying streets the functional classification system creates a hierarchy of classified streets the city functional classification system directly addresses all streets that are under the jurisdiction of the city state highways under the jurisdiction of the washington state department of transportation are all legally designated arterials rcw  for purposes of comprehensive planning and this code and pursuant to rcw  the city of lakewood has classified and designated its city streets in three general categories principal arterials minor arterials and local access roads these classifications have the same meanings respectively as the terms major arterial secondary arterial and access streets as those terms are used in rcw  the city of lakewood has further designated a fourth category collector arterial as shown in this code and as used in the citys comprehensive plan lakewoods street designations are consistent with the federal functional classification system for city streets   principal arterials principal arterials provide service for principal traffic movements within the city they serve centers of activity  intraarea travel between lakewood and other suburban centers between larger communities and between principal trip generators principal arterials serve the longest trips and carry the principal portion of trips entering and leaving the overall area typically they are the highest traffic volume corridors in the city the design year adt is generally more than 15000 vehicles per day they frequently carry important intraurban and intercity bus routes the spacing of principal arterials usually varies from about one mile in highly developed business areas to five miles or more in rural areas service to abutting land should be subordinate to the provision of travel service to principal traffic movements  this service should be incidental to the primary functional responsibility of the street desirably it is located on community and neighborhood boundaries or adjacent to but not shopping centers parks and other homogeneous areas + | street name | from | to | + | bridgeport way wsw | mcchord drive south city | leach creek north

generators they provide service to mediumsize trip generators such as less intensive commercial development high schools and some junior highgrade schools warehousing areas active parks and ball fields and other land uses with similar trip generation potential they distribute travel to smaller geographic areas and communities than those identified with the principal arterial system they provide service to trips of moderate length of a somewhat lower level of travel mobility than principal arterials the design year adt is approximately 5000 to 20000 spacing of minor arterials is usually less than one mile in fully developed areas they provide intracommunity continuity and are typically a continuous street with a direct rather than a meandering alignment they may carry local bus routes minor arterials allow for more emphasis on land access than the principal arterial system they usually do not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods + | street name | from | to | + | ardmore

such as schools or churches within residential areas should be considered within the local circulation pattern not only from within the subdivision but from adjacent neighborhoods as well there should be a limited number of access points with the arterial streets that border a subdivision local access streets should be designed for relatively uniform low volume of traffic upon full development the system should be designed to discourage excessive speeds and should minimize the necessity for traffic control devices internal streets with direct lot access should be discontinuous so as to discourage local access streets provide direct access from abutting land to the arterial street system there are usually no bus routes on local access streets through traffic is deliberately discouraged   minimum street standards see the engineering standards manual current edition for street details pavement for all city streets shall meet the requirements outlined in the engineering

flow control to reduce the impacts of storm water runoff from hard surfaces and land cover conversions this requirement shall be interpreted as follows within the city of lakewood athis minimum requirement applies to projects that discharge storm water directly or indirectly conveyance or overflow system into a fresh water body bthis minimum requirement applies to projects that discharge storm water to a cityowned conveyance system which subsequently infiltrates storm water however for this scenario the level of control required for such discharges will be approved on a sitebysite basis by the city engineer the intent is to ensure that drainage from the project site will not exceed the capacity of the downstream conveyance andor the downstream infiltration system cthis minimum requirement is waived for sites that will infiltrate on site all runoff from hard surfaces and converted vegetation areas 2thresholds the following require construction of flow control facilities andor land use management bmps that will achieve the standard requirements of the doe stormwater manual aprojects in which the total of effective impervious surfaces is 10000 square feet or more in a

their attributes and characteristics wetlands shall be rated using the latest adopted version of the washington state wetland rating system for western washington published by the washington state department of ecology state wetland rating system the state wetland rating system provides the detailed criteria for establishing wetland categories wetlands are generally designated as follows acategory i wetlands are those that 1 represent a unique or rare wetland type  or 2 are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands  3 are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime  or 4 provide a high level of functions generally these wetlands are not common and make up a small percentage of the wetlands in the region the following are considered category i wetlands 1bogs 2mature and oldgrowth forested wetlands 3wetlands that perform many functions very well wetlands scoring 23 to 27 points using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington ecology publication no 1406029 bcategory ii wetlands are difficult though not impossible to replace and provide high levels of some functions these wetlands occur more commonly than category i wetlands but still need a relatively high level of protection category ii wetlands in western washington include wetlands that perform functions well wetlands scoring between 20 and 22 points using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington wetlands scoring 20 to 22 points were judged to perform most functions relatively well or performed one group of functions very well and the other two moderately well ccategory iii wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions scores between 16 and 19 points using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington category iii wetlands usually have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category ii wetlands dcategory iv wetlands have the lowest levels of functions scores between nine and 15 points and are often heavily disturbed these are wetlands that we should be able to replace and in some cases be able to improve these wetlands may provide some important functions     regulated activities a list of regulated activities is included in lmc    exemptions a list

investigation indicate that a potential wetland is located within 200 feet of the project area for a proposed onefamily dwelling unit or other proposed regulated activities the department shall require a wetland verification report to determine whether or not a regulated wetland is present and if so its relative location in relation to the proposed project area or site the findings of the wetland verification report shall be documented as outlined in subsections b1 of this section 4if department staff completes a field investigation and determines that no regulated wetlands are present

based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington 1the use of the buffer widths in table 141 requires the implementation of the measures in table 142 where applicable to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses 2if an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in table 142 then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required for example a 75foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100foot buffer without them 3the buffer widths in table 141 assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion if the existing buffer is unvegetated sparsely vegetated or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the

applicable city land use codes and regulations or to actions requiring replat amendment alteration or vacation of a plat or short subdivision this chapter is also intended to ensure compliance with the survey recording act     scope the boundary lines separating two lots of record may only be adjusted under the provisions of this chapter extinguishing such lot lines or the merger of lots is also considered a boundary line adjustment subject to the requirements of this chapter actions which change or impair conditions or requirements imposed by previous platting decisions must be accomplished pursuant to the subdivision regulations boundary line adjustments shall not acreate any additional lot tract parcel site or division  bresult in a lot tract parcel site or division which contains increased density or insufficient area or dimension to meet the minimum requirements for area and dimension as set forth in the land use and health codes and regulations this provision shall not be

regulations specified in this title if a described use is not listed as a use in a particular zoning district it shall be considered to be a prohibited use within that district excepting land uses listed as prohibited uses in lmc however it is inevitable that certain valid justifiable uses of land will be missing from the listings of uses permitted in various zoning districts therefore the community development director is authorized to make an administrative interpretation in accordance with the procedures of this section bif a proposed use is not specifically listed an applicant may request an interpretation from the community development director as to whether or not such use is a permitted use in determining whether a proposed use closely resembles a use expressly authorized in the applicable zoning districts the community development director shall examine the characteristics of the development and use and shall make a determination as to what zones the development and use may be allowed as a primary permitted use or permitted with an administrative use permit or with a conditional use permit based on the following criteria 1the use is compatible with the applicable goals and policies of the comprehensive plan 2the use is consistent with the stated purpose of the applicable district or districts 3the requested use is most substantially similar to the listed uses permitted in the district in which the request is being sought as opposed to its similarity to the listed uses permitted in other districts based on the following criteria athe activities involved in or equipment or materials employed in the use  bthe effects of the use on the surrounding area such as traffic impacts noise dust odors vibrations lighting and glare impacts on public services and facilities and aesthetic appearance  cthe use has a high degree of potential to be consistent compatible and homogenous with listed uses  dthe size of the facility cunlisted developments and uses for which the community development director has made an administrative interpretation as to appropriate zone and type similarity shall be considered to constitute an official interpretation and shall subsequently be applied and used for future administration in reviewing like proposals the community development director shall report such decisions to the planning commission when it appears

available the comprehensive plan creates an overlay area in which senior housing is to be focused this section carries forward the comprehensive plans intent in creating regulatory incentives for senior housing within the senior housing overlay sho  18a applicability  senior housing overlay this section applies at the developers option to landuse applications for senior housing within the sho except for the construction of a singlefamily dwelling on one 1 lot that can accommodate only one 1 dwelling based upon the density of the underlying zoning designation this section shall not apply to congregate care and group living facilities  18a provisions  senior housing overlay aall of the provisions and requirements of the citys housing incentives program set forth in lmc 18a housing

enacted legislation related to sexually oriented businesses sobs based upon information and findings relevant to this prior legislative actions included city of lakewood ordinances no 171 and 258 lakewood adopted in may of 199 provided for the licensing of and regulation of conduct within adult cabarets based these regulations in part upon the citys lack of a clearly demarked commercialbusiness district the location of commercial and business land uses near residential neighborhoods and the need to protect citizens  especially children  from criminal and unlawful activities and impacts associated with sobs these impacts are known as and are generally referred to herein as the harmful secondary effects of sobs adopted in february of 200 regulated the location and zoning of sobs within the city cited a detailed review of the national record regarding the harmful secondary effects of sobs as well as studies from cities such as new york indianapolis san diego and los angeles found convincing documented evidence based upon that record to find that sobs have detrimental effects upon nearby businesses and residential neighborhoods the legislative record and findings of ordinances no 171 and 258 are incorporated herein by this reference as if set forth fully herein and such records and findings are cited hereby as support for the zoning regulations created in this to adoption of this the pab held public meetings to consider relevant amendments to the citys comprehensive plan during a public hearing held on  approximately 35 people testified and many written comments were submitted in response to the citys proposed amendments which at that time contemplated concentrating all sobs within the city into a single defined overlay area the comments were overwhelmingly negative and cited citizen perceptions regarding the adverse effects that adult entertainment and sobs have upon the community neighborhoods and families exposed to such land uses citizens resoundingly stated their belief that concentrating sobs into a single zone would irreparably harm a thriving business community located near the proposed overlay the pab then recommended to the city council that the comprehensive plan goals and policies related to sobs be deleted to allow flexibility to implement the changes shown in this because by state statute amendments to the citys comprehensive plan can be made only once per year the city council adopted this amendment to the comprehensive plan on  thereafter public meetings were held and the pab worked with a variety of stakeholders in formulating sob zoning regulations that fit the specific needs community and conditions of the city the stakeholder groups included representatives from businesses educational institutions community leaders and representatives from the adult entertainment industry after amendment of the citys comprehensive plan the pab commenced studying alternative sob zoning proposals the pabs research and study resulted in the specific findings listed below based upon these findings the pab recommended to the lakewood city council that the harmful secondary effects of sobs be minimized upon the zoning operating and locating of sobs as specified in this pab found that of overlay areas within the city wherein sobs could locate the city could control the locations where sobs exist and minimize the harmful secondary effects sobs have upon business districts neighborhoods and residential areas further by creation of two or more overlay areas where sobs will be allowed the city can minimize the impact sobs have upon any individual neighborhood or district within the city the city council passage of this does hereby adopt the specific findings of the pab in regard to zoning sobs stated as follows amaterials submitted to the pab demonstrated that sobs can create harmful secondary effects upon the communities they are located in are detrimental to and conflict with the peace and tranquility of neighborhoods and residential land uses and if left unregulated can cause deterioration of property values and increased crime and public disturbances in the areas in which they are located bcitizens and business owners within the city have publicly expressed their fear of the harmful secondary effects sobs cause and have testified that they strongly oppose sob land uses citizens have expressed that they believe sob land uses are harmful to neighborhoods and negatively impact families and children business owners have expressed concern that sob land uses may impact commercial areas and business districts increasing incidents of crime and decreasing property values cbased upon a review of land use patterns zoning and demographics throughout lakewood the pab found that some areas are entirely unsuitable for and incompatible with sob land uses such areas include residential neighborhoods and locations in close proximity to churches and schools the pab also found that the harmful effects of sobs may be minimized if sobs are limited to the areas where they currently exist  to areas that contain no residential land uses or only nonconforming residential land uses  and areas separated topographically andor geographically from residential neighborhoods churches and schools dthe pab found that the creation of overlay areas wherein sexually oriented businesses may locate is in the best interests of the city of lakewood and necessary to protect the public health safety and welfare protecting preserving and improving the quality of its residential neighborhoods is sufficient to justify zoning regulations upon sobs as shown in the washington state supreme courts opinion in northend cinema inc v city of seattle 90wn2d 709 585 p2d 1153 1978 ethe pab reviewed police incident reports that documented the occurrence of crimes within adult cabarets in the city since adoption of the citys adult entertainment standards of conduct and violations in 199 three adult entertainment cabarets have offered or allowed entertainment that violated city regulations these adult cabarets are lipstix now known as stilettos the new players club and the dj vu nightclub police incident reports and court records regarding these violations are contained within the legislative record for this the pab has reviewed the administrative actions city officials have taken against the business licenses issued to adult entertainment cabarets these administrative actions have included revocation of the new players clubs business license a thirty 30 day suspension of lipstix business license and a pending action to revoke stilettos business license for one year the specific facts violations and crimes that form the basis for these administrative actions are contained within the legislative record gthe pab has reviewed records that indicate that improperly operated sobs can be the focal point for a variety of crimes these crimes were documented in the case of heesan corp v city of lakewood 118 wnapp 341 75 p3d 1003 2003 wherein it was shown that entertainers at the new players club a sob located in the ponders neighborhood of lakewood engaged in many illegal practices these practices included entertainers offering to perform and engaging in sexual conduct in exchange for money entertainers performing at less than four feet from the audience and entertainers engaging in improper physical contact with customers additionally the decision in heesan corp v city of lakewood contained documentation that the premises of the new players club was used for the unlicensed consumption of alcohol for illegal smoking of marijuana and for the sale of other illegal drugs hthe pab reviewed records that indicated that the harmful secondary effects of an improperly operated sob can constitute a public or moral nuisance such a nuisance would impact the community as a whole although the impact would be particularly burdensome to the employees and patrons of the business and to property owners and persons residing and working in close proximity to the offending sob land use ithe pab concurred with the findings of the city of lacey in the rationale for the adoption of city of lacey ordinances no 11422 and 112 regarding urban growth area zoning and adult entertainment facilities when adopting these ordinances in 1996 and 199 the city of lacey found that studies in austin texas and in the state of michigan provided convincing evidence that crime increased in areas close to adult businesses the city of lacey also cited to a detroit michigan report and to evidence gathered from seattle and tacoma washington that demonstrated that cities and metropolitan areas experienced harmful secondary effects related to adult entertainment activities these harmful secondary effects can cause a detrimental impact upon residential land uses leading to destabilization of residential areas and depressed property values jthe pab concurred with the findings contained in city of spokane ordinances no 32778 and 330 where the spokane planning services department documented evidence that adult bookstores and adult entertainment establishments create harmful secondary effects including negative health safety economic and aesthetic impacts upon neighboring properties and the community as a whole the pab cited to world wide video v city of spokane no 0235936 9th cir 2004 as documenting evidence of the harmful secondary effects of adult entertainment and as further support for the belief that reducing the undesirable effects of adult entertainment and sobs is a substantial governmental interest that can be achieved with time place and manner restrictions upon where such businesses may locate within a city kthe pab reviewed studies that indicated that adult bookstores generate harmful secondary effects upon neighborhoods families and the community the pab also reviewed police incident reports that indicated that crimes involving indecent exposure can occur at adult bookstores that contain panoram devices  18a purpose and intent based upon the findings of the pab the city council for the city of lakewood does hereby adopt this the purpose of minimizing the harmful secondary effects of sob land uses within the city it is the intent of this protect lakewoods citizens persons who own property within the city and people who travel city from crime blight and other harmful secondary effects associated with sobs by limiting the areas in which sobs are allowed to operate the lakewood city council intends to protect families children and residential neighborhoods from crimes nuisances and disturbances of the public peace and safety  to protect residential neighborhoods and business districts from blight and deterioration of property values  and to protect foster and support the goals and ideals of schools religious and public service organizations serving the lakewood community it is not the intent of this suppress any constitutionally protected speech or expression this intended as a content neutral regulation to diminish and control crime and the harmful secondary effects associated with sobs while allowing the existence of constitutionally protected expression  18a sexually oriented business overlays created there are hereby created sexually oriented business overlays sobos within the geographic areas of the city as identified and depicted on exhibit a sobos attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein sexually oriented businesses as defined within this title may locate only within the sobos identified in exhibit a  s note exhibit d of is on file in the city clerks office 18a applicability  sexually oriented business land uses athis section
