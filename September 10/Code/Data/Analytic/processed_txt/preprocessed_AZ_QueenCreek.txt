infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 15 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 raise substantial governmental concerns 16 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 17 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 18 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 19 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 20 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 21 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a revised 112015 limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 22 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 23 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 24

protect the town for the potential secondary effects adults business including crime the protection of the towns retail trade the prevention of the blighting of neighborhoods and the maintenance of property values protecting and preserving the quality of the towns quality of life the increased threat of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the protections of the peace welfare and privacy of persons who patronize adult businesses experience in this town as well as in cities and counties within and outside of arizona including the county of los angeles the city of garden grove and the cities of renton washington  seattle washington  detroit michigan  austin texas  indianapolis indiana  and phoenix arizona have demonstrated that such uses have objectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent residential and commercial areas the town recognizes and relies upon the experience of these other cities and counties in adopting adult businesses regulations including the county of los angeles as discussed in smith v county of los angeles 211 calapp3d 188 1989  city of renton washington as discussed in city of renton v playtime theaters inc475 us 41 1976  the city of

commissioners 723 fsupp 695 sd fla1989 in support of this town also recognizes and relies upon the studies done by 1 the 1979 adult use study by the phoenix planning department  2 tucson arizona 1990  3 the 1991 report to the city of garden groves by drs mccleary and meeker on the relationship between crime and adult business operations  4 the city of los angeles in 1977  5 the 1984 analysis of

effects of adult businesses  10 amarillo texas 1977  11 beaumont texas 1982  12 houston texas 1983  and 13 seattle washington 1989 2 prior to the adoption of this ordinanc e the town council reviewed the detailed studies prepared by other jurisdictions regarding the social and economic effects on a persons and properties surrounding established adult used facilities copies of these studies are available for the public review upon request the town council believes the following statements are true in part based upon its understanding of the experiences of various jurisdictions identified 3 crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas surrounding adult uses than in industrial areas surrounding adult uses 4 areas within onethousand feet 1000 of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of adult uses 5 adult uses should be restricted to specific areas of the town which are specified distance from sensitive uses such as residences parks religious institutions and schools irrespective of whether physical barriers are present this is necessary to 1 insure that the impact on such sensitive uses by adverse secondary effects cause by adult uses are mitigated to the maximum extent possible  2 to prevent ad hoc decisions with respect to potential adult use site which does not meet the criteria set forth herein  and 3 to provide certainty to the residents of the town and adult use operators with respect to potential adult use sites 6 the image of the town of queen creek as an attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of adult uses in closed proximity to article 6  supplemental use regulations may 2019 town of queen creek  residential uses schools religious institutes and parks 7 the existence of adult uses in close proximity to residential areas has been shown in some cities to reduce the property values in those residential areas 8 a reasonable regulation of the location of adult uses protects the image of the community and its property values and protects its residents for the adverse secondary effects of adult uses while providing those who desire to patronize adult uses an opportunity to do so in appropriate areas in the town 9 there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and being aggravated by adult businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use prostitution pandering and violenc e against persons and property the studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adult which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas causing among other adverse secondary effects an increase in crime and a decrease in property values regulations for adult business should be developed to prevent deterioration and  or degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than waiting for problems to be created 10 the town council recognizes and relies on the findings set forth in the 1986 attorney generals report on pornography in support of this ordinanc e including but not limited to its recommendations that local government s band certain features of video booths that facilitate carnal sexual encounters a copy of the attorney generals report on pornography is available for public review upon request 11 the town council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the document and judicial decisions in the public record a evidence indicates that some dancers models and other person who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly displayed anatomical parts in adult businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult businesses on the site of the adult business  b evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  c evidence indicates that performers at adult businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitutions in acts with patrons of the establishment  and d as a result of the above and the increase of incidence of aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases town have a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibilit y for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adult businesses 12 the town council has determined that the establishment of an adult use development permit process is a legitimate and reasonable means of insuring that a operators of adult businesses comply with the reasonable regulations of this   b the recognized secondary impacts of a proposed adult use business in a specific location are mitigated  and c adult use operators have specific guidelines with respect to where they can establish or operate an adult business 13 it is not the intent of the town council in adopting this suppress any activities protected by the first amendment but rather to enact content article 6  supplemental use regulations may 2019 town of queen creek  neutral which addresses the secondary effects that adult uses have on the town 14 the town council desires to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to adult use businesses in a manner that insures the continued and orderly development of property within the town and
