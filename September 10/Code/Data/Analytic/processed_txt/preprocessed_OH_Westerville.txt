wherefore this ordinance is declared an emergency measure and shall take effect from and after its passage s       richard h gorsuch      chairman of council passed           approved s    roy e metz     director of law preliminary unit editors note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter ohio legislative history references  ohio revised c o 01

purpose and intent athe planned urban district pud is intended to accommodate compact walkable mixed use developments in certain areas of the city as defined in  and to provide for the opportunity for a mixeduse pattern of development as outlined in the community plan the district allows for the integration of commercial retail office medium to highdensity housing and in some cases light industrial uses within walking distance of public transit based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a particular environment is determined not only by the type and arrangement of land uses but also the way in which such uses are developed the procedures outlined in this chapter are designed to 1encourage imaginative site and architectural design  2permit creation of flexible development standards that respect the unique characteristics of the site and surrounding uses  3result in more efficient and beneficial use of land  and 4regulate development and redevelopment of individual parcels within already improved areas bin order to accomplish the above purpose the intent of this chapter is to provide for the establishment of development standards that 1promotes the mixing of uses particularly integration  2inspires the use of alternative transportation and construction of transit supportive design  3allows flexibility for imaginative and unique projects while remaining compatible and in context with the architecture materials landscaping natural site qualities and streetscape found in the area  4develops an aesthetically suitable public environment that incorporates common open space  and 5avoids the creation of nuisances and maintains the public health safety and welfare of the community at large c1the process for achieving the above purposes and intent is to require the submission and approval of an application to zone the property to pud along with a preliminary plan proposed development standards text and supplemental narrative statement for the total proposed development these materials must clearly identify any standard which is less restrictive than the applicable standards in this chapter or the zoning must justify the proposed development standards as a whole to achieve the purposes set forth above 2the applicant will then submit and receive approval of a development plan for all or any part of the area defined in the preliminary plan prior to obtaining a zoning certificate 3as part of the final development plan the applicant must reaffirm use of the previously approved development standards text or submit as part of the development plan a

singlefamily and twofamily residential uses shall be screened as follows a parking areas adjacent to a public street or private roadway shall be developed with plant mounding or fencewall material

height of 4 plant material should be used to soften and add visual interest to a wallfence a plant material screen shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventyfive percent 75% at all times the use of year round vegetation such as pines or evergreens is encouraged c the separation and landscaping of the required bufferyard will provide adequate screening for all other parking lot perimeters 2 interior parking area landscaping landscaping within parking areas whether ground cover or other upright plant material is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat and runoff but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas the use of parking islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot is one of the most effective ways to landscape parking lot interiors the use of shade trees in these landscape areas is encouraged any open parking area including loading areas containing more than 6000 square feet of area or 15 or more parking spaces shall provide the following interior landscaping in addition to the required perimeter screening a an area equal to five percent 5% of the total size in square feet of parking areas smaller than 15000 square feet shall be landscaped and permeable for lots between 15000 and 29999 square feet the landscaped area shall equal seven and one half percent 75% for lots larger than 30000 square feet the landscaped area shall be ten percent 10% b whenever possible large parking areas of 30000 square feet or larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse and create the appearance of smaller parking lots this distinction or separation can be achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and by taking advantage of natural features such as slope existing woodland or vegetation drainage courses and retention areas c landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in peninsulas or islands minimum island or peninsula size shall be 200 square feet with a 2 minimum distance between all trees or shrubs and the edge of pavement where vehicles overhang and a minimum width of 10 d the planning commission as part of the site plan review process may vary the requirements for minimum and maximum size of parking islands and peninsulas if situations including but not limited to the following exist 1 the need to concentrate landscape areas for the purpose of stormwater detention  2 the need to relocate required landscaping on the perimeter of a parking area in the case of a small or unusually shaped lot or where additional screening is desired 3 required plant materials for the interior of parking areas a one deciduous tree shall be required for every 3000 square feet of parking area or for every 10 parking spaces b where site distance or maneuvering
