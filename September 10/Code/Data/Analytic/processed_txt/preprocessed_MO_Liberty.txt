wireless communications facilities to protect the health safety and welfare of the public while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the city of liberty specifically this article is intended to a provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the city of liberty  b minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties  c ensure that any new wireless communications facilities are located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible  and d ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally

regulate the floodplain area designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize losses due to flood hazards which will 1 restrict or prohibit uses that in times of flooding can cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities or can be dangerous to the public health safety and welfare of the community  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  3 provide public information for evaluating land purchases that are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard  and 4 maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d i 41105  i 72715   flood losses the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development and obstructions in areas of flood hazard that cause increases in flood heights and velocities  2 the inadequate anchoring of obstructions that may cause damage to uses in other areas  and 3 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods that may be hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise inadequately protected from flood damage i 41105  i 72715   methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this udo is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for clay county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the regulatory flood  3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point  4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height  5 delineation of a flood fringe the area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood i 41105  i 72715   floodplain buffer  general provisions 1 applicability this section shall
