standards introduction the streets and infrastructure in the town of bremen as well as all other municipalities represents a considerable investment of resources and is typically one of the major financial assets of a community because of this major asset town personnel continually strive to insure the construction of these facilities meets minimum acceptable standards quality construction of these facilities results in reduced maintenance increased longevity and less financial burden to the residents of the community this publication is provided as a guide to aid owners developers government officials and others by providing minimum standards for the design and construction of municipal streets and utility systems they are intended to provide a minimum standard of quality for the types of materials and construction techniques to maintain consistency with existing facilities each individual situation or construction project is unique with its own set of circumstances therefore owners and developers are encouraged to enlist the aid of qualified consultants engineers contractors etc to analyze site conditions and to efficiently design each project within the minimum standards presented herein alternate materials and methods of construction will be considered on a case by case basis these standards are divided into the following three articles 01 general information and guidelines this section provides general information which sets forth the basic guidelines for various items of construction this section should be reviewed for each project to determine the standards that apply to the proposed work once the applicable standards have been identified standard specifications and standard drawings should be consulted for specific details of materials and methods of construction 02 standard specifications this a compilation of selected specification for various items of municipal utility and street construction the section headings and numbering system conforms to the construction specifications institutes masterformat this system is utilized throughout the construction industry to provide uniformity of information the section numbers are not consecutive since all section of the masterformat are not applicable to these standards each section is subdivided into three parts the first part is a general section providing references and general information the second part provides detailed specifications on the projects to be utilized during the construction the third part is titled execution and defines the methods of construction one or more of the specification sections may be applicable for each project number reference standards 01410 testing laboratory services 01570 traffic regulation 02110 site clearing

standards for various items of construction the key to implementation of these construction and design standards is cooperation and communication between the town of bremen and the owners engineers

requested to notify the town of bremen of an impending project at the earliest possible date preferable during the preliminary or design phase of the project notification and inquires should be
