general administration the village public works director director is designated to administer and enforce this article exh a 3152016 findings of fact the pewaukee village board finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled soil erosion and storm water runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing ground water recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of ground water by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers drainage ways and other storm drainage systems  6 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  and 7 generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment exh a 3152016 purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this article is to establish regulatory requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize the threats to public health safety welfare and the natural resources of the village from construction site erosion and postconstruction storm water runoff specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  establish erosion control and storm water standards for building sites placement of structures and land uses  and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger property b intent through a single storm water permit process this article is intended to meet the current construction site erosion control and postconstruction storm water management regulatory requirements of subchapter iii of both nr 151 and nr 216 wis admin the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived nothing in this article prevents the wisconsin department of

development purpose this division is intended to promote compatible development  stabilize property values  foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community as a place to live and work  preserve the character and quality of the built and natural environment  and raise the level of community expectations for the quality of its environment this division applies to commercial industrial institutional park and multifamily residential development 141 541999 findings a the village of pewaukee board finds that 1 trees and shrubs are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival  2 trees and shrubs appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe  3 trees and shrubs transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems  4 trees and shrubs have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers  5 trees and shrubs root system stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  6 trees and shrubs are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas  7 trees and shrubs have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values  8 screening between two lots lessens the transmission of noise dust and glare from one lot to another  9 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimum screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can entirely shield one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening  10 establishing and maintaining architectural standards will tend to maintain a high character of community development and protect real estate from impairment and destruction of value  11 architectural standards will tend to prevent or minimize discordant and unsightly surroundings  12 architectural standards will protect and perpetuate a pleasant and inviting view for the enjoyment environmental and cultural enrichment of the citizens of the community and its visitors  13 architectural standards will foster civic pride in the beauty of the community and enhance the communitys aesthetic and economic vitality  14 the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare 142 541999 landscaping screening berming and

1 the wisconsin legislature has provided for the punishment treatment and supervision of persons convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children including their release into the community indeed wis stats ch 980 provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons the purpose of this section is to protect the public to reduce the likelihood that convicted sex offenders will engage in such conduct in the future the united states supreme court has recognized that the risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is high and when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault see smith v doe 538 us 84 123 sct 114 155 led 2d 164 2003 and mckune v lile 536 us 24 34 122 sct 201 153 led2d 47 2002 citing united states department of justice bureau of justice statistics sex offenses and offenders 27 1997 us department of justice bureau of justice statistics recidivism of prisoners released in 1983 1997 the village board has reviewed research on sex offenders including the findings of a number of states across the united states including but not limited to florida georgia alabama iowa and california as they pertain to laws adopted and which relate to imposing restrictions on sex offenders with respect to residency  and in addition the united states court of appeals for the 8 th circuit decision on doe v miller 405 f3d 700 716 8 th cir 2005 providing in part the record does not support a conclusion that the iowa general assembly and the governor acted based merely on negative attitudes toward or fear of or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group citations omitted sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism and the parties presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense even experts in the field could not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among those who cross over to offend against a younger child or the degree to which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk of reoffense against children one expert in the district court opined that it is just common sense that limiting the frequency of contact between sex offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of an offense citations omitted the policymakers of iowa are entitled to employ such common sense and we are not persuaded that the means selected to pursue the states legitimate interest are without rational basis the board finds the negative consequences of failing to regulate the movement of sex offenders is a hazard to children and the community thus the village has a duty and need to regulate where sex offenders reside and loiter within the village once they are reintegrated into the community this section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of the children in the village of pewaukee from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences it is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the villages compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing residence  and by regulating certain activities that may be used by sexual offenders to prey on children 2 the village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools daycare centers and other places children frequent the village finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers children congregate or play at public parks the board notes that wis stats  6134 authorizes the village board to enact legislation for the health safety and welfare of the public in addition wis stats  61345 notes that the powers rights and privileges accorded villages under said chapter are to be liberally construed in order to promote the general welfare peace good order and prosperity of the

ordinance  principles and standards for the aesthetic evaluation of site and building projects a introduction and intent the process of private building and development in a community may be simple or complex depending upon the size of the project the number of participants the ease of communication among the various private and public parties involved and the content and clarity of the public rules and regulations while the community representatives cannot usually directly affect either the project size or the number of project participants  they can have a direct affect on the content and clarity of rules and regulations as well as the communication and indeed interpretation of any such rules and regulations like inhabitants of most developing communities pewaukee city officials and citizens have legitimate concerns about both the future character of the community and the integrity of existing and historic development one such concern is in regard to land uses or the mix of land uses both existing and planned another concern is the financial capability of development developers to provide the required and promised improvements and the financial capability of the community to provide the necessary and requested services a third major concern importantly is in regard to the visual impact or image of the community by people living within or only traveling city the intent or purpose of this subsection is to provide principles and standards for use by property owners potential developers and city officials in the preparation and review of site and building plans proposed within the city with emphasis on and the primary objective of heightening the visual character and quality and therefore the value of the sites and buildings proposed and thereby the entire community it is understood that such visual enhancement is also expected to be maintained over time and not be only an initial accomplishment to be forgotten the proponents of any single or multiple use development other than an individual singlefamily or twofamily building proposed to be undertaken within the city of pewaukee must pursuant to subsection  present a site and building plan to the plan commission for review and approval such approval along with any conditions must be granted prior to receipt by the ownerbuilderdeveloper of a permit to commence building or site development activity the intent of this subsection of the zoning ordinance is twofold to provide a systematic equal basis for review and discussion of projects  and to provide general guidelines to be used in the review of a development or building project in order to identify specific standards for the visible elements of site and building design which embody the general desires of the community a set of agreed upon principles have been established which form the foundation for the standards which will follow b site planning and design principles it must be noted that a principle is a truth or tenet  a statement of fact as relates to a particular topic in this case site planning and design following is a list of principles which should be utilized by everyone concerned in any site planning and design project in the city of pewaukee 1 the development or building site must be viewed as only one element of the total developed and undeveloped environment in the vicinity of the city of pewaukee municipal code 13 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 site therefore attention must be given to how the site and the development on the site will ultimately fit into the total environment 2 site planning and design is the process by which site features and uses on the site are made to be compatible functional and visually pleasing 3 all elements and aspects of the site both natural and manmade are important to the aesthetic character of the site 4 adjacent or contiguous uses or facilities may have a major affect on the site or site uses 5 major changes in elevations and land forms on the site which thereby change the character andor physical capabilities of the site are not generally conducive to good site development unless such changes are well planned and are necessary as an example  a quarry to final developmentredevelopment of the quarry site 6 the specific location of site access is critical to both the future use of the site and the safety and convenience of persons traveling on adjacent public ways 7 site grading landscaping paving fencing lighting signage storm water drainage and other site enhancement are an integral part of any building and development project c building design layout and construction principles following is a list of principles which should be utilized by everyone concerned in any building design layout and construction project in the city 1 no side or facade of a building or structure is exempt from public view and consequently all sides or facades should be visually pleasing and architecturally and aesthetically compatible 2 the shape size dimension architectural style facade material texture and color building landscaping building signage and the setting of the building within its immediate environment are all elements of the building structure design addressed by the designer both individually and in concert 3 each color texture or material of which the exterior of a building is composed may individually present a visual statement to the viewer and therefore in order not to present a conflicting or complex visual statement the arrangement and mix of colors textures and materials should be carefully considered and the number of such elements minimized 4 some building materials present a visual statement of strength and permanence to the immediate environment and to the community and should be encouraged while other materials which make a building or structure appear temporary should be avoided 5 individual buildings may be attractive but when duplicated on the same or adjacent parcels or on the same horizontal plane may detract from the visual character of the overall development city of pewaukee municipal code 14 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 6 some use elements of a building structure such as outside mechanical equipment loading docks and areas trash storage areas and raw material vehicle or equipment storage areas are not usually attractive and often detract from the visual appearance of the building unless careful attention is given to placement construction structural andor landscape screening of such areas 7 building landscaping that is landscaping which is or appears to be an integral part of the building facade design needs to be carefully planned and the appropriate grading and plant materials used so as not to detract from the architecture of the building 8 building signage that is signage which is or appears to be an integral part of the building facade design needs to be carefully planned and the appropriate sign materials size message wording sign lighting and color used so as not to detract from the architecture of the building or be disruptive d site planning and design standards a standard or criteria is either a quantitative or qualitative model or value level by or against which all related actions or activities are measured in this regard a standard is sometimes referred to as a yardstick moreover quantitative standards are those which when applied will reveal a quantitative difference or similarity between the standard and the action or activity being measured by the standard for example  the action related to a site planning standard that states that no manmade slope or disturbed natural slope shall be greater than  when 3 is the horizontal measurement can be measured quantitatively to determine if indeed the standard has been met a qualitative standard on the other hand is a standard which when applied involves a judgment usually subjective that the action or activity has met or can meet the stated standard for example  a site planning standard that states that all parking areas shall be screened in a visually pleasing manner to soften the visual presentation of parked cars and paved area requires that the persons making the determination as to whether or not the standard is met actually looks at the screening structure device or plant materials and makes a qualitative judgment if it can be concluded that the materials device or structure as designed or constructed are individually or collectively visually pleasing there should be no problem making such a judgment if however the materials are different in character the judgment is usually more difficult even the arrangement of several individually pleasing materials may not in concert be pleasing whenever possible we try to avoid purely qualitative standards following are both quantitative and qualitative standards related to site development which will be used by the plan commission in the review of every site or development plan 1 standard no sd1 a the natural landscape of a development site including topography ponds drainage ways vegetation and soils shall be disturbed to the least extent possible to accomplish ultimate site development and to ensure such protection the plan commission may require a specific survey and presentation of vegetation encompassed within the site city of pewaukee municipal code 15 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 b final manmade site grades on a continuous slope of more than 100 feet in horizontal distance shall not exceed  on any part of the site where 3 is the horizontal dimension and shall not exceed a  grade on more than 20 percent of the site 2 standard no sd2 a the drainage pattern on the site shall not be changed significantly and no change to the drainage pattern on lands in the immediate vicinity of the site shall be allowed b storm drainage outfall from the completely developed site and generated from a 100 year recurrence interval base flood rain storm event shall not exceed the physical ability of the streams drainage ways or storm sewer immediately adjacent and downstream from the site to accommodate such periodic storm drainage and shall be in compliance with all wisdnr and fema rules and regulations 3 standard no sd3 a all streets interior to the development site whether private or public and all public utilities shall be constructed to city construction standards in terms of crosssection grades and construction materials b no segment of any public or private street within the overall development site shall exceed 10 percent vertical grade and no segment of any such street shall exceed 8 percent vertical grade for a continuing horizontal distance of more than 200 feet see of city ordinances c approved points of access between streets within the development site and intersecting arterial or collector streets shall be designed to accommodate a minimum four 4 lane divided entry for a minimum distance of 250 feet into the development site when the average daily traffic adt on such entry is expected to exceed 500 4 standard no sd4 a no more than 60 percent of any lot parcel or total development site shall be covered with buildings paving gravel or other covering materials which are impervious to surface water absorption also see subsection  b no less than 40 percent of the development site shall be retained in either an undisturbed natural state or in attractive planned and arranged ground cover and landscape plantings earthen berms and natural or manmade water impoundments c except in single and twofamily residential areas no impervious surface including graveled area shall be placed closer than ten 10 feet from a property boundary d an existing designated wetland or designated 100 year recurrence interval base flood floodplain may comprise no more than 20 percent of the total green space requirement on any parcel as set forth in 4b above or no more than two square feet of each required ten square feet 5 standard no sd5 city of pewaukee municipal code 16 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 a fencing designed to visually screen areas of the site from passersby shall be of a type and quality and constructed of materials that will be aesthetic and compatible with the building structures b site fencing shall be designed and constructed to be readily maintained in a safe and aesthetic manner 6 standard no sd6 a lighting of the site shall be of a type design color height and intensity to blend with the site and landscaping but in no case shall light poles be taller than 20 feet measured from ground level b lighting of the site shall be of a design and height and be located andor shielded so as to illuminate only the site and not be a beacon of distraction or potential hazard to traffic or to people working or living in the vicinity of the site and specifically the individual light source and the direct radiation from lights with wattage greater than 150 shall not be visible from adjacent streets or residential property unless specifically approved by the plan commission 7 standard no sd7 signage of uses and buildings on the site shall be limited by the plan commission in number size height and type so as not to detract from the visual attractiveness of the site or architecture or be a distraction to the traveling public or the neighborhood in general see section  e building design standards standards must be related to the various principles which in turn are related to the overall objective which in this case is to heighten the visual character of sites and buildings in the city of pewaukee it should be noted that the visual aspects of building design are difficult to relate to quantitative standards and therefore many of the building design standards must be qualitative following are both quantitative and qualitative standards related to the visual aspects of building construction which will be used by the plan commission in the review of every site plan or development 1 standard no bd1 principle and accessory buildings presented for review shall be carefully designed so as to compatibly integrate architectural style size shape building material color and texture landscaping lighting and signage 2 standard no bd2 a all buildings on a property shall be designed to integrate the principal building materials color and texture on all sides of the buildings b each side of a building shall be designed to be individually visibly pleasing 3 standard no bd3 a the number of materials textures or colors that visually change the appearance of the building shall be limited to no more than three b painted unpainted or anodized metal panels used as a facade material shall not be extended or have the appearance of extending to within four city of pewaukee municipal code 17 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 4 feet of the ground elevation and shall comprise no more than ten 10 percent of the facade of any side of a building c bright or fluorescent colors which attract or detract the eye shall not be used except as incidental trim comprising no more than 5 percent of the facade of any side 4 standard no bd4 a architectural types or styles which are unorthodox or which are considered to be incompatible with surrounding buildings shall not be allowed except where adjacent buildings or structures do not meet the standards b buildings constructed within a development shall not be so similar in exterior appearance that they appear to be the duplicate of the other unless placed on different horizontal planes or widely different vertical elevations 5 standard no bd5 a building appurtenances such as loading docks solid waste storage areas and mechanical or utility equipment shall not be located on the street side of any building and shall be permanently screened from general view on all other sides or roofs of the building by use of compatible building materials dense landscaping or both b building landscaping lighting and signage shall be presented as an integral part of the building design and shall not be so large or distinct as to detract from the architecture of the building 6 standard no bd6 structural expansion or rehabilitation of existing buildings shall be designed to comply with the standards set forth herein f overriding considerations the foregoing standards are required to be met by all builders and developers in the city of pewaukee in certain or specific situations however the strict application or adherence to established standards is not possible for example where a physical hardship would be created by strict adherence to a standard and where there is no alternative which could meet the standards good sense would dictate that the specific standard be reduced or perhaps waived by the plan commission or common council in that individual case following are a series of considerations which may be reviewed and if found to apply to a specific situation should be applied and thereby either override or enhance the standards involved in that specific case 1 the natural terrain of a site may be so diverse or severe that total adherence to pertinent standards is not possible in such cases the standard should be met to the extent possible or a suitable alternative found as approved by the plan commission 2 the landscaping of a site and even the fencing and building structures on the site should be so arranged as to attractively screen from the general view of the traveling public those areas on the site not enclosed within a building which are not inherently attractive such as auto parking areas truck and construction equipment parking areas large paved areas trash city of pewaukee municipal code 18 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 receptacles building related mechanical equipment aboveground utility facilities and raw material storage 3 in most cases the use of one or two building materials or colors or textures is sufficient to establish the visual character of a building in a limited number of cases the design of the building requires the use of several exterior materials each of which in turn may have differing textures and colors in such cases care must be taken by the designerbuilderdeveloper to clearly identify the necessity for such diversion from the standards 4 many types of totally or partially metalclad buildings do not give the visual impression of permanence and in addition such buildings are often vulnerable to both physical and visual decay within a relatively short period there are those cases however where buildings have been or may be designed using special metallic panels which are at once both durable and visually attractive and not merely an inexpensive method of building construction in such cases when it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the plan commission that a building having more than ten 10 percent of the building facade covered with such metal panels is both attractive and provides a visual permanence within the community the plan commission may reduce or waive those standards which relate to such cases 5 in some cases the existing buildings in a partially developed area do not meet the standards set forth herein or have deteriorated to such an extent that they are visually displeasing and may even appear blighted or dilapidated in such cases the introduction into the area of a new building which meets the standards may appear to be incompatible with the existing development but should be construed as the initial redevelopment of the area even though not in visual conformance with its surroundings 6 the arrangement of like or similar structures on a site or on contiguous parcels at different elevations different planes or at different angles may visually change the appearance of the individual structure such arrangement should be carefully considered in the review of building plans on the other hand simply changing the facade color texture or material on like or similar buildings may not be sufficient to change the overall exterior appearance also the plan commission in reviewing plans for a development proposal encompassing several buildings may find it desirable for the buildings to have the same architectural style or the same exterior building materials in order to visually tie the individual buildings to each other to form a cohesive grouping or cluster 7 in specifically defined sections of neighborhoods called subneighborhoods or arterial street or highway corridors it may be in the special or increased interest of the city to establish site andor building standards that are more stringent than the standards set forth in previous subsections of this ordinance when it is deemed necessary to establish more stringent standards in specific areas of the city for a specifically defined purposes the plan commission shall publish a notice and hold a public hearing pursuant to hear comments and questions regarding the proposed standards after which the plan commission shall make a recommendation to the common council following such recommendation the common council may adopt the standards as proposed  reject the proposed standards  or adopt the proposed standards with modification special standards so adopted shall take effect immediately following posting of a common council resolution enacting such special standards special standards so city of pewaukee municipal code 19 of 191 chapter 17  zoning last revision 102014 adopted shall be in effect within the prescribed area until such time as they are rescinded or changed by the common council after a public hearing is conducted following the same procedures as set forth above  reduction or joint use no
