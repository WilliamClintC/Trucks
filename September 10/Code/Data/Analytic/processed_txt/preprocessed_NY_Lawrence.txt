channel basin and the land adjacent to reynolds channel crooked creek and broswere bay and the creeks and streams tributary thereto and is generally described as follows  862 findings the areas to which this chapter applies consist principally of marsh and meadowland immediately adjacent to and crossed by tidal creeks and streams the greater part of which marsh and meadowland is covered with water during spring tides and during storms the development of this region involves many problems which do not exist elsewhere in the village and which directly affect the safety and health of persons who may live work or be present there the protection of their property and the protection of a bannister creek basin bounded on the west by doughty boulevard  on the north by rock hall road  on the east by causeway  and on the south by barrett road and a line part of which is marked by a road or former road located where the meadowland and the upland adjoin it also includes the island sometimes known as williams island which lies between reynolds channel and a portion of bannister creek b woodmere channel basin bounded on the east by the village line  on the north by a line part of which is marked by a road or former road designed as cedarhurst avenue and located where the meadowland and the upland adjoin  on the west by the upland of the former albro farm  and on the south by broswere

might result in a heavy loss of life and great destruction of property b the unstable nature of the surface or of subsurface soil of the marsh and meadowland which among other things tends to 1 result in uneven subsidence of the fill which may be placed thereon 2 result in changes in grade and consequent fractures and disalignment of sewers drains curbs and pavements 3 make difficult the permanent retention of the fill in place 4 endanger the stability of foundations of dwellings and other structures c the small elevation above tidewater which makes unsafe and unsanitary the use of cesspools

 woodmere club ccwc b purpose 1 the purpose of this section in coordination with the contiguous neighboring town of hempstead town and village of woodsburgh is to regulate development in the environmentally sensitive coastal areas that span the municipal boundaries of the village and the contiguous town and village of woodsburgh including the area occupied by the woodmere club allowing for the enhanced preservation and protection of the villages and neighboring town and village of woodsburghs environmental coastal open space natural and cultural resources and the preservation of the residential neighborhoods both within the village the village of woodsburgh and the unincorporated areas of the town in and about the former woodmere club 2 in the lowlying southern coastal areas of the village and the adjacent contiguous town and village there are located golf courses that have been in place for more than a century which open spaces provide not only recreation but a natural mitigation against adverse impacts on the environment and therefore the wellbeing and safety of the entire region 3 climate change is becoming the defining environmental issue of our time particularly for vulnerable lowlying coastal areas this change has taken shape already in the form of more frequent and intense storms sea level rise and extreme flooding it is no longer a future endeavor but rather a sound planning imperative that the village the town and the village of woodsburgh immediately address ongoing and future conditions including greater risks of flooding presented by sea level rise and enhanced storm surge inland flooding expected to result from increasingly frequent extreme precipitation events and the increased risk of compound flooding resulting from simultaneous storm surge and heavy precipitation through proper and coordinated regulation the village intends to do its part in preserving the health safety and wellbeing of residents in the area of the woodmere club and the surrounding community 4 along the coast and particularly in lowlying coastal areas it is imperative that the village town and the village of woodsburgh as stewards of the environment and protectors of their community safety health and welfare assure that flood risk mitigation measures effectively preserve the floodplain and surrounding areas as the department of environmental conservation has expressed the goal of managing the floodplain is not only to ensure that new development is reasonably safe from flooding but to address existing risks to avoid increasing risk to others and to sustain natural capacities to slow and diffuse flood flows reducing development in floodprone areas allows the natural landscape to absorb more floodwaters reduce flooding to adjacent areas recharge groundwater and sustain a healthy ecosystem 5 as a result of declining golf participation and membership at eighteenhole golf clubs golf courses are closing including the woodmere club the land of the woodmere club the woodmere club property is approximately 1184 acres in size and is located partially in the village approximately 229  212131 zoning  212131  acres the town approximately 55 acres and village of woodsburgh approximately 405 acres 6 as a result this large and mostly open coastal area spanning the boundaries of these three contiguous municipalities is vulnerable to residential and commercial development seriously threatening both this environmentally sensitive coastal area and the wellbeing of the village the town the village of woodsburgh and the region as a whole and which potential adverse impacts and loss of existing open space will not be adequately mitigated by existing and inconsistent zoning regulations in both the contiguous town and villages with respect to permissible development lot size lot coverage density building height and sitespecific development regulations 7 it is the belief of the village in coordination with the contiguous town and village of woodsburgh that unless addressed the loss of this existing open space to overdevelopment in the environmentally sensitive coastal area of the village presents an immediate threat to the public health and safety of the village the adjacent town and village of woodsburgh and the region as a whole and can best be mitigated and the additional benefits accomplished with the coordinated creation of matching complementary coastal conservation districts in each municipality in conjunction with the adjacent contiguous town and village of woodsburgh 8 the woodmere club property is located in a relatively vulnerable lowlying coastal area well within a special flood hazard area 100year floodplain and the new york state coastal boundary area the woodmere club property is also impacted by shallow groundwater conditions the new york state department of environmental conservation nys dec has identified the presence of significant natural communities and rare plants and animals at the woodmere club property the woodmere club property has also been identified by the new york state office of parks recreation and historic preservation oprhp as a potentially archeologically sensitive area given the presence of these environmental and cultural resources the village intends to provide for a cluster development in accordance with village law  7738 with reduced lot size requirements in this area to properly conserve and protect the lowlying vulnerable coastal area and natural area and resources 9 a traditional subdivision layout with a minimum lot size of 40000 square feet within the approximately twentytwoandninetenthsacre village portion of the course would have a gross yield of approximately 21 lots but the net yield would be reduced significantly when accounting for area regulations open space andor parkland preservation roadway and infrastructure elements and reserved drainage areas clusterstyle development provided herein and in the contiguous town and village of woodsburgh portions of the woodmere club property provides for the preservation of some of the most sensitive environmental portions of the property while permitting sustainable residential development utilizing a cluster subdivision technique within all three municipalities sustainable design elements will be required in all residential development applications incorporating a sustainable approach and lowimpact development principles  212131 lawrence code  212131  10 while the village recognizes its responsibility to provide for a properly balanced and wellordered plan of development and land uses within its community it also recognizes that in enacting local zoning consideration must be given to regional needs and requirements and that there must be a balancing of the local desire to maintain the status quo within the community and the greater public interest that regional needs be met 11 the new york state general municipal law  239nn indicates the intent and purpose of the state of new york to encourage the coordination of land use development and regulation among adjacent municipalities in order that each adjacent municipality may recognize the goals and objectives of neighboring municipalities and as a result development occurs in a manner which is supportive of the goals and objectives of the general area and neighboring municipalities 12 pursuant to  and 2a of the new york state constitution as effectuated by general municipal law j  119u village law  7741 and town law  284 the village town and the village of woodsburgh agreed to coordinate regulation and entered into an intermunicipal cooperation planning and land use regulation agreement the intermunicipal cooperation agreement with the purpose of undertaking mutually beneficial shared and coordinated comprehensive planning and land use regulation for the woodmere club property in order to promote intergovernmental cooperation increase coordination and effectiveness of comprehensive planning and land use regulation make more efficient use of infrastructure and municipal revenues and resources as to enhance the protection of community resources which span municipal boundaries 13 it is in that spirit and pursuant to agreement of all three municipalities to work together and the intermunicipal cooperation agreement that the village in conjunction and coordination with the adjacent contiguous town and village of woodsburgh adopts and creates the coastal conservation district  woodmere club ccwc for the village of lawrence 14 the coastal conservation district woodmere club ccwc district represents an intermunicipal plan that addresses current and future physical climate risk changes due to sea level rise storm surge and flooding the district recognizes these impacts in relation to the unique geographical setting of the property at the woodmere channel terminus its historical and environmentally and ecologically sensitive setting and the anticipated flood impacts associated with this location the risks to both private and public and existing and future development from flooding in this location under current and anticipated future conditions necessitates multijurisdictional regulation guided by preservation and protection the ccwc district incorporates climate change considerations while preserving both existing development and infrastructure as well as protecting future development including development on the club property from the virtual certainty of increasing flood risks as time progresses 15 the coastal conservation district  woodmere club establishes three subdistricts to ensure the preservation of existing open space and regulate  212131 zoning  212131  development in a manner that is compatible with area zoning and development patterns the open spacerecreation subdistrict and the singlefamily residential subdistrict both include portions of the village and the contiguous town of hempstead and village of woodsburgh while the clubhouse hospitality subdistrict is located wholly within the village of woodsburgh the three subdistricts are described in of this section 16 the village of lawrence board of trustees hereinafter village board finds that the creation of this zoning district with its three subdistricts is in harmony with the coordinated creation of a similar zoning district in the contiguous town of hempstead and village of woodsburgh is in the public interest and that the provisions of these coordinated contiguous complementary zoning districts in each municipality are in the interest of the protection and promotion of the public health general welfare and safety of both the residents of the village and contiguous town of hempstead and village of woodsburgh 17 the creation of this district in coordination with the contiguous municipalities is intended to preserve the villages natural resources and environmental features while also preserving community character and the economic value of other properties in the neighborhood in and about the woodmere club property special consideration is provided for sustainable design elements which will help to mitigate flood impacts preserve open space decrease stormwater runoff improve local water quality and reduce traffic impacts the regulations contained within this section have been designed to
