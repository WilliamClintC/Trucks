zoning ordinance can only regulate new technology after its discovery and use therefore as scientific discovery creates new possibilities a community must look to its master plan and community image to guide the manner in which technological advancements are accommodated over time some discoveries that at first seem to be only novelties such as electricity become fundamental to our way of life these public necessities or essential services if unavailable or removed would cause great inconvenience negatively impact the public health safety andor general welfare and result in revised patterns of development because our standard of living and the public health safety and general welfare depend on the provision of essential services zoning ordinances often allow essential services providers to follow more lenient design standards than would be applied to private developers other technological advancements are not essential but have become convenient to our way of life we would like to accommodate these conveniences efficiently but with greater concerns for aesthetics and location we have seen that wireless communication has evolved to be a public convenience and that as public acceptance and use of wireless communication systems increased the equipment required to provide this convenience has become smaller andor less obtrusive on the environment we believe that wireless communication will continue to grow and that as it grows the trend to smaller andor less obtrusive equipment will continue 1 purpose the purpose of this to a carry out the will of the united states

the applicants actions the zoning board of appeals must determine that the hardship that led to the use variance request was not selfcreated by the applicant 6 the variance would not be contrary to
