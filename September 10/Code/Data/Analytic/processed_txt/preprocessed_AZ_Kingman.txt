the ordinance is intended to provide for the safe orderly and reasonable use of hillside areas while protecting the public health safety and welfare by 1 determining whether certain types of soil conditions exist such as loose or easily eroded soils or rocky soils and utilizing appropriate engineering technology to result in stable slopes during and subsequent to development 2 reduction of water runoff and changes in the natural drainage patterns soil erosion and rock slides by minimizing grading and requiring revegetation 3 permitting intensity of development compatible with the natural characteristics of hillside terrain such as steepness of slope significant landforms soil suitability and existing drainage patterns 4 promoting cost effective public services by encouraging development in less steeply sloped areas and ensuring adequate access for emergency vehicles 5 protecting the public from damage and liability by ensuring that hillside development is of a sound and reasonable nature  applicability of regulations the previsions of this ordinance apply to all singlefamily multiplefamily and commercial development in areas meeting the criteria listed below in addition to these regulations all other applicable development regulations of the kingman zoning also be met no industrial development shall be permitted on lots with an average cross slope of fifteen percent 15% or greater 1 any parcel of land within the city of kingman with a fifteen percent 15% or greater average cross slope acs 2 any parcel of land within the city of kingman exhibiting a slope of twentyfive percent 25% or greater that has at least a ten 10 foot drop and runs parallel to one of the contour lines on the site topographic map for a distance of fifty 50 feet 3 exceptions a existing buildings and structures are exempted from meeting these regulations unless any proposed modifications result in an increase in floor area of fifty percent 50% for residences and twentyfive percent 25% for commercial buildings acs   0023 x i x l i   contour interval l   contour length a   area a acs   average cross slope average cross slope is calculated by adding the length of each contour line on the site topographic map this length is converted to scale length in feet the sum of the lengths l of all contour lines is multiplied by the contour interval 1 in feet the result is multiplied by the factor 023 which converts the square footage of the scale map to acres this result is divided by the area a of the site in acres the answer to this formula is the average cross slope acs refer to figure 1 at the back of this section to determine if the property has any slopes that are higher than twentyfive percent 25% drop more than ten 10 feet and have a parallel length of over fifty 50 feet first determine the change in elevation of all steep areas on the contour map of the parcel if these are more than ten 10 feet draw a line perpendicular to the contour lines and determine the true distance between the high and low contour line divide the change in elevation by the distance and multiply by onehundred 100 to calculate the percent of slope if this is twenty five percent 25% or higher measure the length of the contour lines parallel to the slope if the true distance is of any one 1 of the contour lines if over fifty 50 feet then these hillside regulations apply to that parcel refer to figure 1 at the back of this section  process these requirements are meant to provide for the administrative review of hillside developments the planning office will ensure compliance with these regulations in addition to other requirements of the kingman zoning normal building permit application process any lot with a fifteen percent 15% or greater acs or any lot

drawings with smaller scales however in no case may the scale be reduced below one 1 inch equals one hundred 100 feet if all proposed grading is limited to areas of the property with less than fifteen

established to provide general development performance standards for the study areas covered by the hualapai mountain road area plan these standards are intended and designed to aid in the implementation of the area plan  to encourage sound design principals  to assure the compatibility of uses  to encourage attractive appearances  to prevent blight  and to promote and enhance the health safety and general welfare of the residents in the community this manual establishes minimum standards the city encourages developers and landowners to exceed these minimums whenever possible  introduction the 1988 hualapai mountain road area plan required the development of a design review manual to be used in conjunction with the area plan the city does not propose to establish a specific theme but rather encourages high quality and creative developments that are architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and the colors and textures of the surrounding environment during the design review process the city will be looking at more than just a buildings design a projects layout its relationship to the immediate neighborhood and its relationship to the entire study areas will also be examined special considerations are given to sign landscaping screening and setback requirements which are more specific than the citys zoning should be understood that the city staff does not solve design problems for the applicant the design review guidelines have been placed under general headings to facilitate their uses  applicability the standards set forth in this manual shall apply to 1 hualapai mountain road all development commercial and residential 2 all commercial developments 3 the future parkwaycollector street located along the west section line of along the east section line of  all development commercial and residential  procedure the review will be done inhouse by the city planning staff currently the planning staff reviews all preliminary and final subdivision plats parcel plats site plansbuilding permits sign permits variance requests rezoning requests conditional use permit requests business license applications and general planarea plan amendment requests the mohave county planning department refers certain development proposals for land adjacent to the city limits to the city planning staff for review for the state urban land the state land

the state land department for the lands which are included in the area plan but which lie outside of the city limits it is recommended that anyone who is considering a development project within the
