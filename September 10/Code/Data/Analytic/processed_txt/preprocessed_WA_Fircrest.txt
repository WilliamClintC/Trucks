proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival 2trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and transpire considerable amounts of water each day thereby playing a vital role in purifying the air 3trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers 4trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control 5during the past several decades the percentage of tree canopy cover in the puget sound region has declined dramatically as a result of urban growth and other human activities 6trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments of the land particularly streets and parking areas as such trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values bbased on the policy statement in subsection a of this section the planning commission and city council declare that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the citys planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this chapter to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments   general landscaping

combined dbh of significant trees may be retained to meet the retention standard for sites one acre or larger 35 percent of the total tree canopy area on a site may be retained in lieu of retaining trees based on percentage of trees or combined dbh trees located within a critical area or its buffer are exempt from these provisions as their retention is generally required pursuant to critical area regulations bfor areas of a site with slopes  15 percent the minimum retention percentage required in subsection b1a of this section is increased to 50 percent the retention percentage for the entire site however remains 35 percent the intent is to encourage relatively greater tree retention on steeper slopes and provide greater design flexibility for areas not encumbered by steeper slopes 2exemptions afor a new singlefamily dwelling on an existing lot of record the removal of significant trees located within the proposed building and driveway footprints and within 10 feet of these

chapter may be given landscaping credit for retaining significant trees on site the level of credit shall be determined by the director on a casebycase basis taking into account the level of screening or buffering or the extent of canopy coverage provided by the trees to be retained etree replacement when the required number of significant trees cannot be retained as determined at the sole discretion of the city each significant tree removed shall be replaced with trees of a type similar to the tree being removed unless the applicant requests an alternative type of tree eg deciduous instead of evergreen and the director determines that the alternative tree will provide a comparable or greater benefit to the community the replacement ratio for the removal of significant trees which are not exempt from this chapter shall be as follows minimum tree replacement ratio significant tree replacement plantings evergreen tree 12  24 inches dbh one 10foot tall tree or two trees between six and 10 feet tall evergreen tree > 24 inches dbh two 10foot tall trees or four trees between six and 10 feet tall deciduous tree nine to 15 inches dbh two twoinch caliper trees minimum eight feet tall deciduous tree > 15 inches dbh four twoinch caliper trees minimum eight feet tall required street trees shall not count as replacement plantings if the tree replacement requirement

concerns of the citizenry and the image the citizens have of their community whether planned or happenstance the results are a reflection of and in turn reflect upon the image the citizens present to themselves and to outsiders bgood designs are not expensive the final results are not more costly to build than poorly conceived badly designed developments and in fact may cost less to build and operate an appropriately scaled building with enhancing facades signage color and ornamentation can provide the same interior square footage as an illconceived rectangular box  and may even be more functional and efficient cgood designs result from a process that includes forethought planning standards examples critical reviews and consequence the purpose of this chapter is to define and illustrate those features that the community finds to be worthy of emulation when the design of new projects is undertaken dthese guidelines seek to suggest possible design concepts and approaches that realize the desired state the guidelines use the verbs should and may rather than shall and must recognizing that the objective is the ends not the means the guidelines seek to achieve a community design aesthetic within a process that allows individual expression and flexibility to meet changing circumstances while enhancing the ambiance of the city ethese guidelines do not alter the land uses or densities allowed in the underlying zoning districts defined in the preceding sections of this code rather these guidelines seek to define and illustrate how new developments can respond to the character of the surroundings fwhile the standards defined in this chapter are guidelines and not regulations a project developer will demonstrate how each relevant guideline has been accounted for a project developer may propose alternative solutions but each relevant criterion will be addressed     natural features intent  retain natural features and landmarks as open space amenities

these standards and guidelines shall apply unless otherwise provided   design standards and guidelines adopted the city of fircrest design standards and guidelines for streetscape elements as shown in exhibit a to incorporated in this section by reference is hereby adopted and codified within this title   applicability athe design standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to this chapter shall apply to streetscape improvements required in conjunction with development that includes or requires the construction of new streets or the substantial modification of existing streets that would be classified as principal and minor arterials major collectors local streets access lanes alleys and paseos bthe city shall determine whether modifications to existing streets are considered substantial and therefore subject to compliance with the design standards and guidelines pavement overlays not associated with significant changes to pavement section design and the installation of utilities within a public street row are not considered to be substantial improvements the construction of sidewalks or curb and gutter where none currently exists or significant changes to pavement section design may be considered substantial modifications cretrofitting existing streets to accommodate new or modified transit bicycle or pedestrian facilities shall take into account existing street designs and the challenges associated with designing a project to fit within a previously built environment while complying with the intent of applicable streetscape design standards and guidelines these provisions are intended to provide the city with sufficient discretion to adjust project designs to effectively transition between new and existing improvements dthe city may apply the design standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to this chapter to new private streets or driveways located within developments that do not include the subdivision of land in order to achieve the same design quality and function as would otherwise be provided by a public street for example the city may apply these standards and guidelines to new or substantially modified multifamily development

effects of one land use on another use or property can be prevented or minimized subdivision regulations and building codes other aspects of development however are more subtle and less amenable to exacting rules enacted without regard to specific development proposals among these aspects of development are the general form of the land before and after development spatial relationships of the structures and open spaces with adjacent land uses and the appearance of buildings signs and open spaces as they contribute to the community one of the paramount goals of the citys comprehensive plan is to retain or recreate the qualities that comprise livable memorable and diverse community life within fircrest zoning and other numerical standards and formulas are inadequate tools by themselves for building a livable community in that they cannot ensure quality of physical design design review is intended to be a complementary means of retaining enhancing or creating a sense of community physical structures   purpose the purposes of design review are ato promote those qualities in the natural environment which will be beneficial to the community bto foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community as a place to live and work cto preserve the special character and quality of fircrest by maintaining the integrity of those areas which have a discernible character or are of special historic significance dto raise the level of community expectations for the quality of the built environment eto encourage originality and creativity in site planning and

before any administrative design review approval may be granted the director shall determine that the following criteria are met by a proposal athe general design considerations including the character scale quality of design and quality of materials are consistent with the purpose of this chapter and adopted design guidelines bthe proposal complies with all applicable development standards cthe proposal is consistent with the goals policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan   application procedures administrative design review is classified as a type ii application the processing procedures for this application are described in chapters 2205 2206 2207 2208 2209 and 2210 fmc   administrative design review process administrative design review requires a comprehensive staff review to ensure project compliance with all applicable development regulations contained in this code the design guidelines adopted in this title and incorporated by reference in fmc and the goals policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan administrative design review may consist of either a onestep or twostep process depending on the complexity of the proposal and the preferences of an applicant aonestep process the onestep process consists of a detailed design review typically conducted at the time plans are submitted for a building permit or other construction permit review btwostep process the twostep process typically begins with a review of conceptual plans conducted concurrently with the review of a discretionary land use permit application once a discretionary land use approval is granted for a conceptual design detailed plans shall be prepared by an applicant and submitted for final design review this second review is intended to ensure that all design issues identified during the review of the conceptual plans are fully addressed prior to issuance of a building permit or other construction permit an optional twostep process may also be requested by an applicant for a proposal not requiring discretionary land use approval this option provides an applicant with an opportunity to submit conceptual plans for review prior to the preparation and submittal of detailed plans for a building or other construction permit   submittal requirements application for administrative design review shall be submitted on forms provided by the department a minimum of two sets of the following plans and other information shall be submitted with the application in clear and intelligible form when determined by the director to be applicable and necessary to complete the design review aelevation plans elevation plans shall be provided for each building or structure elevation that is subject to design review additions and alterations to existing structures shall be clearly identified on the plans design details such as exterior finish materials and textures lighting and other fixtures and design elements such as beltcourses brackets chimneys cornices roof overhangs window trim sills and sashes shall be identified bexterior mechanical device screening plans all proposed exterior mechanical devices including roofmounted equipment and proposed screening shall be identified on the architectural and mechanical plans in addition plans of any proposed screening design shall be submitted when mechanical plans are submitted without a corresponding building permit application the location of all exterior and roofmounted mechanical devices shall be shown on a building elevation plan ccoordinated site design plan a site plan shall

to remain and be removed to ensure effective implementation of comprehensive plan policies and objectives and development regulations relating to design applications for administrative design review and other discretionary land use permits for the same proposal shall be submitted concurrently for review   administrative design review modification and exemption an applicant may request administrative approval of modifications to a plan previously approved for design review by submitting two sets of plans which clearly identify the proposed changes to the previously approved design the director may determine that athe proposed modification is exempt from further review because it represents a minor change from the originally approved plans and the criteria listed in fmc  continue to be met by the proposal  or bthe proposed modification is subject to additional review because it represents a major change from the originally approved plans and further review is necessary to determine whether the criteria listed in fmc  would continue to be met by the proposal a request to modify a previously approved design which has been determined to be subject to additional review shall be processed using the same procedures applicable to the original design review process the director may impose conditions on an exempted modification or a modification subject to further review to ensure that the intent and conditions of the original approval are met deviations from a plan approved for design review are not permitted unless an applicant first obtains approval in accordance with this section   duration of an administrative design review approval in the event that an administrative design approval is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval it shall automatically become null and void  provided however that for good cause the director may grant a onetime extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 15 days prior to the date of expiration for the administrative design review approval a properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final the process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original administrative design review application before taking action to grant an extension the director shall determine that the following circumstances exist athe proposal approved under the terms of the administrative design review approval originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards and design guidelines contained or referenced in this title if the proposal no longer conforms to this title as a result of more restrictive standards or guidelines being adopted subsequent to the original approval the director may consider a modified proposal which would comply with the more restrictive standards or guidelines bthe findings adopted in support of the original administrative design review request remain valid and supportive of the time extension request   optional administrative design review fmc  identifies categories of projects which the city has determined have the greatest potential to impact a neighborhood or the community the designs of other projects which are exempt from administrative design review however may also have the potential to impact a neighborhood or the community for example modifications to historic homes which fail to take into account the original architectural design may be detrimental to the character of the home as well as the historic fabric of the surrounding neighborhood an individual proposing an exempt project may request a nofee review of their design by the director the purpose of this review is to familiarize the individual with specific design guidelines which would apply to the project if it were subject to review under fmc  and to identify possible design solutions which could be used to enhance the quality of the design the individual will be encouraged but not required to design the project in a manner which is consistent with the adopted guidelines  conditional use permits purpose authority criteria for conditional use permit approval application procedures submittal requirements amendment of conditional use permit performance bond duration of a conditional use permit approval limitation on refiling of application  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish decision criteria and procedures for special uses called conditional uses which possess unique characteristics conditional uses are deemed unique due to factors such as size technological processes equipment type or duration of activity or location with respect to surroundings streets existing improvements or effects or demands upon public facilities these uses require a special degree of control to ensure consistency with the comprehensive plan and compatibility with adjacent uses and the character of the surrounding neighborhood or community conditional uses will be subject to review by the hearing examiner and the issuance of a conditional use permit this process allows the hearing examiner to adetermine that the location and characteristics of these uses will be compatible with uses permitted in the surrounding area  and bmake further stipulations and conditions that may reasonably ensure that the intent of this title will be served     authority the hearing examiner may approve approve with conditions modify and approve with conditions or deny a conditional use permit the hearing examiner shall grant a conditional use permit when it has determined that the criteria listed in fmc  are met by the proposal the hearing examiner may impose specific conditions upon the use including an increase in the standards of this title which will enable the hearing examiner to make the required findings in fmc  these conditions may include but are not limited to restrictions in hours of operations  restrictions on locations of structures and uses  structural restrictions which address safety noise light and glare vibration odor views aesthetics and other impacts  and increased buffering requirements including open space berms fencing and landscaping     criteria for conditional use permit approval before any conditional use permit may be granted the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal athe proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health safety and welfare  injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity  or adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity bthe proposed use will meet or exceed all applicable development design and performance standards and guidelines required for the specific use location or zoning classification cthe proposed use will be consistent and compatible with the goals objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan dall conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use are measurable and can be monitored and enforced     application procedures

detailed plans by the director however an applicant may elect to submit conceptual plans for a preliminary review to obtain the advice of the director as to the applicability of the intent standards and provisions of this chapter to the plan once the director has provided this advice the applicant will be directed to prepare and submit detailed plans to the director for a final review bmajor site plan review major site plan review consists of two separate reviews the initial review is conducted by the hearing examiner and the second review is conducted by the director the plans submitted for the initial review may be conceptual in detail however the greater the level of detail in the plans submitted for hearing examiner review the greater the level of certainty the applicant will have in preparing detailed plans for final review when the hearing examiner determines that a site plan meets the criteria listed in fmc  the hearing examiner will grant a preliminary approval and direct the applicant to prepare and submit detailed plans to the director for final site plan review this second review is intended to ensure that all site planning issues identified during the hearing examiners initial review are fully addressed prior to issuance of a building permit or other construction permit     submittal requirements application for site plan review shall be submitted on forms provided

chapter a minor or administrative variance and a major or hearing examiner variance a minor variance is one that is within 10 percent of the standard contained in this title and which may be approved by the director a major variance is one that is greater than 10 percent of the standard contained in this title and which may be approved by the hearing examiner the appropriate review authority director or hearing examiner shall grant a variance from the provisions of this title when it has determined that the criteria listed in fmc  have been met by the proposal when granting a variance the review authority may attach specific conditions to the variance to ensure that the variance will conform to the criteria listed in fmc  and all other applicable codes design guidelines and comprehensive plan goals and policies the review authority shall not grant a variance which establishes a use otherwise prohibited within a zoning district     criteria  major and minor variance approval abefore any major variance may be granted the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal 1there are special circumstances applicable to the subject property or to the intended use such as size shape topography location or surroundings that do not apply to other property or classes of use in the same vicinity and zoning classification 2the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use which is possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zoning classification but denied to the subject property because of special circumstances 3the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning classification in which the subject property is located 4strict enforcement of the provisions of this title would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for the property owner 5the practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship has not been created by the owner or by a predecessor in title this finding does not apply if the zoning classification for the property has changed and the difficulty or hardship was created solely as a result of the reclassification 6the granting of the variance will be consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning classification and the comprehensive plan land use designation of the subject property and will not conflict with other applicable codes design guidelines or comprehensive plan goals and policies bbefore any minor variance may be granted the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal 1the variance will not compromise the intent of the comprehensive plan nor be inconsistent with the goals policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan 2the variance is an immediate remedy to a condition which if permitted would not result in any significant adverse impacts to adjacent properties or structures 3a strict application of the standards would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the applicant or property owner 4the need for the variance is not the result of the deliberate actions of the applicant or property owner 5the variance does not create health and safety hazards     application procedures a minor variance is

2293 2294 2295 2296 2297 2299 and  fmc is to designate and classify ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas and to protect these areas and their functions and values while also allowing for reasonable use of private property bthese regulations are to implement the goals policies guidelines and requirements of the citys comprehensive plan and the growth management act cthe city finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents andor may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property the beneficial functions and values provided by critical areas include but are not limited to water quality protection and enhancement fish and wildlife habitat food chain support flood storage conveyance and attenuation of floodwaters ground water recharge and discharge erosion control protection from hazards historical archaeological and aesthetic value protection and recreation these beneficial functions are not listed in order of priority dgoals by limiting development and alteration of critical areas these regulations seek to 1protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury loss of life or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures erosion seismic events or flooding  2maintain healthy functioning ecosystems protection of unique fragile and valuable elements of the environment including ground and surface waters wetlands and fish and wildlife and their habitats and to conserve the biodiversity of plant and animal species  3direct activities not dependent on critical areas resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas  and 4prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat and the overall net loss of wetlands frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas ethese regulations are intended to protect critical areas in accordance with the growth management act and application of the best available science as determined according to wac 365195900 in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals fthese regulations are to be administered with flexibility and attention to sitespecific characteristics consistent with rcw 3670a02012 it is not the intent of these regulations to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of the property or to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development and planned for by the community without decreasing current service levels below minimum standards gthe citys enactment or enforcement of these regulations shall not be construed for the benefit of any individual person or group of persons other than the general public   authority aas provided herein the director is given the authority to interpret and apply and the responsibility to enforce these regulations to accomplish the stated purpose bthe city may withhold condition or deny

an overlay and in addition to zoning and other regulations adopted by the city bany individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall have the buffer and meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved when any existing regulation easement covenant or deed restriction conflicts with these critical areas regulations that regulation which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply cthese critical areas regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under the state environmental policy act sepa as adopted by the city any conditions required pursuant to these regulations shall be included in the sepa review and threshold determination dcompliance with these critical areas regulations does not constitute compliance with other federal state and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required for example hydraulic permit act hpa permits of the national historic preservation act us army

applicable critical areas chapters shall result in equivalent or greater functions and values of the critical areas associated with the proposed action as determined by the best available science all actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the mitigation sequencing order specified in fmc  to avoid minimize and restore all adverse impacts applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before restoration and compensation of impacts will be allowed no activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas   best available science aprotect functions and values of critical areas with special consideration to anadromous fish critical area reports and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish such as salmon and bull trout and their habitat consistent with rcw 3670a1721 bbest available science to be consistent with criteria the best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local state or federal natural resource agencies a qualified scientific professional or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in wac 365195900 ccharacteristics of a valid scientific process in the context of critical areas protection a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local governments regulatory decisions and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the functions and values of critical areas to determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information the director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process such characteristics are as follows 1peer review the information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline the proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers publication in a refereed scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peerreviewed  2methods the methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and reproducible the methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or if not the methods have been appropriately peerreviewed to ensure their reliability and validity  3logical conclusions and reasonable inferences the conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions the conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained  4quantitative analysis the data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods  5context the information is placed in proper context the assumptions analytical techniques data and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge  and 6references the assumptions analytical techniques and conclusions are wellreferenced with citations to relevant credible literature and other pertinent existing information dnonscientific information nonscientific information may supplement scientific information but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information common sources of nonscientific information include the following 1anecdotal information one or more observations that are not part of an organized scientific effort for example i saw a bald eagle in that area while i was hiking  2nonexpert opinion opinion of a person who is not a qualified scientific expert in a pertinent scientific discipline for example i do not believe there are bald eagles in that area  and 3hearsay information repeated from communication with others for example at a lecture last week dr jones said there were no bald eagles in that area eabsence of valid scientific information where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function of permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area the director shall 1take a precautionary or a norisk approach that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved  and 2require application of an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area an adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty an adaptive management program shall aaddress funding for the research component of the adaptive management program  bchange course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties  and ccommit to the appropriate timeframe and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and nonregulatory actions affecting

impact by replacing enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments 6monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures ccompensation for lost or affected functions compensation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions the goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost except when either 1the lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a sitespecific function assessment and the proposed compensatory mitigation actions will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed formal washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol  or 2outofkind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types dpreference of mitigation actions methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference 1restoration reestablishment and rehabilitation of wetlands 2creation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species this should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design 3enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements etype and location of mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either inkind and onsite or inkind and within the same stream reach or subbasin mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the same site as the alteration except when all of the following apply 1there are no reasonable onsite or insubdrainage basin opportunities eg onsite options would require elimination of high functioning upland habitat or onsite and insubdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the natural capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts consideration should include anticipated wetland mitigation replacement ratios buffer conditions and proposed widths available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored proposed flood storage capacity potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  2offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland  and 3offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless aestablished watershed goals for water quality flood or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or bcredits from a state certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the banks certification ftiming of compensatory mitigation it is preferred that compensation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the onsite wetlands at the least compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora the director may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties for example project delay lapses past a fisheries window  or plan installation should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survivability of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety and general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan the justification must be verified and approved by the city gmitigation ratios 1acreage replacement ratios the following ratios in table 2293a shall apply to creation or restoration rehabilitation reestablishment or creation and enhancement or enhancement only that is inkind is onsite is the same category is timed prior to or concurrent with

will be significantly higher than the other ratios for category i wetlands rehabilitation ratios are based on the assumption that actions judged to be most effective for that site are being implemented 2increased replacement ratio the director may increase the ratios under the following circumstances auncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation  or ba significant period of time will elapse between impact and establishment of wetland functions at the mitigation site  or cproposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted  or dthe impact was an unauthorized impact 3reduced replacement ratio the director may reduce the ratios under the following circumstances adocumentation by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success based on prior experience  or bdocumentation by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed actions for compensation will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted  or cthe proposed actions for compensation are conducted in advance of the impact and are shown to be successful  or din wetlands where several hgm classes are found within one delineated boundary the ratios can be decreased if iimpacts to the wetland are all within an area that has a different hgm class from the one used to establish the category  and iithe category of this area with a different class is lower than that of the entire wetland  and iiithe proponents provide adequate hydrologic and geomorphic data to establish that the boundary between the hgm classes lies outside of the footprint of the impacts hpreservation impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation restoration or enhancement at the preservation site or at a separate location preservation may also be used by itself but more restrictions apply as outlined below 1preservation in combination with other forms of compensation using preservation as compensation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration creation or enhancement  provided that a minimum of  acreage replacement is provided by restoration or creation and the criteria below are met athe impact area is small andor impacts are to a category iii or iv wetland  bpreservation of a high quality system occurs in the same water resource inventory area wria or

present or may be introduced on site 3fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration including fish runs and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat   wetland buffers abuffer requirements the standard buffer widths in table 2293b below have been established in accordance with the best available science they are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington 1the use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in table 2293c below where applicable to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses 2if an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in table 2293c then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required for example a 75foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100foot buffer without them 3the standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion if the existing buffer is unvegetated sparsely vegetated or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided 4additional buffer widths are added to the standard buffer widths for example a category i wetland scoring 32 points for habitat function would require a buffer of 225 feet 75 plus 150 table 2293b wetland buffer requirements for western washington wetland category buffer width in feet based on habitat score

connections  maintain connections to offsite areas that are undisturbed  restore corridors or connections to offsite habitats by replanting bconditions for increasing buffer widths or enhancing buffers 1buffer is not vegetated with plants appropriate for the region the recommended widths for buffers are based on the assumption that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion or with one that performs similar functions if the existing buffer is unvegetated sparsely vegetated or vegetated with nonnative species that do not perform needed functions the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions in the buffer are provided generally improving the vegetation will be more effective than widening the buffer 2buffer has a steep slope the effectiveness of buffers at removing pollutants before they enter a wetland decreases as the slope increases if the buffer for a wetland is to be based on the score for its ability to improve water quality rather than habitat or other criteria then the buffer should be increased by 50 percent if the slope is greater than 30 percent 3buffer is used by sensitive species if the wetland provides habitat for a particularly sensitive species such as a threatened or endangered species the buffer width should be increased to provide adequate protection for the species based on its particular life history needs buffer requirements for certain priority species may be obtained from the washington state department of fish and wildlife cbuffer averaging the widths of buffers may be averaged if this will improve the protection of wetland functions or if it is the only way to allow for reasonable use of a parcel 1averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met athe wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a dualrated wetland with a category i area adjacent to a lower rated area  and bthe buffer is increased adjacent to the higherfunctioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion  and cthe total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging  and dthe buffer at its narrowest point is never less than 75 percent of the standard width or 75 feet for category i and ii 50 feet for category iii and 25 feet for category iv whichever is greater 2averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met athere are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging  and bthe averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetlands functions and values as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland expert  and cthe total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging  and dthe buffer at its narrowest point is

of geologically hazardous areas or associated buffers may only occur for activities that 1will not increase the threat of the geological hazard to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions  2will not adversely impact other critical areas  3are designed so that the hazard to the project is eliminated or mitigated to a level equal to or less than predevelopment conditions  and 4are certified as safe as designed and under anticipated conditions by a qualified engineer or geologist licensed in the state of washington bcritical facilities prohibited critical facilities shall not be sited within geologically hazardous areas unless there is no other practical alternative   performance standards  erosion and landslide hazard areas activities on sites containing erosion or landslide hazards shall meet the standards of fmc  and the specific following requirements abuffer requirement a buffer shall be established from all edges of landslide hazard areas the size of the buffer shall be determined by the director to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage death or injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development based upon review of and concurrence with a critical area report prepared by a qualified professional 1minimum buffer the minimum buffer shall be equal to the height of the slope or 50 feet whichever is greater 2buffer reduction the buffer may be reduced to a minimum of 10 feet when a qualified professional demonstrates to the directors satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development adjacent developments and uses and the subject critical area 3increased buffer the buffer may be increased where the director determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development  balterations alterations of an erosion or landslide hazard area andor buffer may only occur for activities for which a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that 1the development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions  2the development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent properties  and 3such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas  cdesign standards development within an erosion or landslide hazard area andor buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative design that deviates from one or more of these standards provides greater longterm slope stability while meeting all other provisions of the applicable critical areas chapters the requirement for longterm slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function the basic development design standards are 1the proposed development shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 15 for static conditions and 12 for
