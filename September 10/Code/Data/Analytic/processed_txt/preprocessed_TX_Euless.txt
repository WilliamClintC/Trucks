businesses on market values by cooper and kelley and crimerelated secondary effects  secondary effects of offsite sexuallyoriented businesses by mccleary june 200 the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further absent municipal regulation aimed at reducing adverse secondary effects there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises    159695 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this sexually oriented theater nude model business escort agency and sexually oriented cabaret engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation prostitution sexual contact and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles or rooms for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing private or semiprivate areas in sexually oriented businesses encourages such sexual activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain sexually oriented theaters sexually oriented arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 and 253448  8 as of  there have been 57199 reported cases of aids in the state of texas 9 since the early 1980s and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in tarrant county texas and across the state of texas 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  according to texas department of health records there were 1175 cases of early syphilis reported in the state of texas during 2000 and an additional 972 cases reported in 2001 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 again according to texas department of health records there were 32895 cases of gonorrhea reported in the state of texas during 2000 and an additional 30116 cases reported in 2001 during the same time period there were also 138692 cases of chlamydia reported in the state of texas arlington community health profile dated july 2003 12 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 16 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns 17 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 18 removal of doors on booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented theaters 19 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the    160695 identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 20 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 21 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 22 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this is a correlation between sexually oriented businesses specifically their hours of operation and the type of people which such businesses attract and higher crime rates baby dolls topless saloons inc v city of dallas 295 f3d 471 5th cir 2002 23 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 24 it is reasonably believed that to better protect the public health safety and welfare it is necessary to adopt additional amendments to this chapter 25 it is reasonably believed that to prevent the exploitation of a loophole in the which would have permitted such businesses to avoid the location restrictions partially nude performances in such businesses are also included within the purview of the regulations since they have the same harmful secondary effects on the surrounding community as sexually oriented businesses currently regulated under the baby dolls topless saloons inc v city of dallas 295 f3d 471 5th cir 2002 26 there is no constitutional right for sexually

and sexual contact and 4302 prostitution 28 attempts by the city of arlington to require sexually oriented businesses to advise customers and employees in a state of nudity to refrain from intentionally touching and fondling each other posted at the business entrance have not been effective 29 sexually oriented businesses have not complied with the no touch provisions but have flagrantly disregarded them andor encouraged employees and customers to violate the no touch provision 30 provocative touching between customers and employees in a sexually oriented business where at least one is in a state of nudity frequently leads to the commission of sex crimes illegal drug use and increased health risks due to sexually transmitted diseases 31 compelling signage at the entrances of sexually oriented businesses has not been effective in halting no touch violations 32 the city of arlington has had to expend considerable law enforcement resources to enforce the no touch provisions 33 the city council reasonably believes that requiring employees in a state of nudity to be physically separated from customers by the use of elevated stages and buffer zones is necessary to better ensure ordinance compliance while still not inhibiting constitutionally protected expressive conduct or speech lleh inc v wichita county texas 289 f3d 358 5th cir 2002 34 the city council reasonably believes that sexual activity occurring in private viewing booths at sexually oriented businesses leads to unhealthy and unsanitary conditions and to the transmission of sexually transmitted and other communicable diseases matney v county of kenosha 86 f3d 692 695 7th cir 1996 35 the city council reasonably believes that certain negative secondary effects including prostitution drug trafficking and assaultive offenses are associated with nude or seminude dancing in environments where alcohol is served or allowed jl spoons inc v dragani 538 f3d 379 382 6th cir 2008 36 the city council reasonably believes that the licensing and permit requirements imposed on sexually oriented businesses that offer onsite entertainment comport with the prompt judicial review and preservation of    161695 the status quo requirements enunciated by the united states supreme court and thus do not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint richland bookmart inc v knox

virtue of being fenced or otherwise shielded from view present increased opportunities for criminal and sexual activity 38 the city council reasonably believes that video monitoring the parking lots of sexually oriented businesses will deter individuals from engaging in criminal and sexual activity in the area being monitored and retaining recordings will assist law enforcement in criminal investigations should any crimes be committed in the area 39 the city council finds that pursuant to the airport zoning act texas local government that the city of euless has no authority to exercise land use regulatory authority over land within its corporate city limits defined as an airport by the act 40 it is reasonably believed by the city council that the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this it is reasonably believed by the city council that adequate sites are reasonably available for sexually oriented businesses that meet

format a single design control system the unified development control document combines zoning and subdivision regulations into a logical single design control system this unified or combined approach

neighborhood collector streets should be designed so as to discourage their use as crosstown arterial streets c pedestrian oriented children can walk to school and play areas ways or open space corridors separated from streets and the hazards of moving automobiles d residential or local streets residential streets should provide good access to residential units but should be planned so that they will not be used as traffic routes culsdesac and curved street layouts should be used to promote low traffic volumes and preservation of residential character e schools and parks the elementary school and neighborhood park and playground should be located in the center of the residential area while major streets are routed along the perimeter each family should be within onehalf mile of the
