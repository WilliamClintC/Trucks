purpose a background there is an interest by some town of smyrna electric consumers in sources of onsite generation of electricity as a means to reduce pollution environmentally friendly production of electricity such as solar or wind andor to reduce the ever increasing cost of retail electricity recent increases in the cost of wholesale and retail electricity have provided an increased incentive for consumers to further research alternatives to retail electric supply from their electric utility alternatives often sought by consumers include customerowned renewable resources such as  photovoltaic windpower microgenerators fuel cells powered by renewable fuels or gas from the anaerobic digestion of organic materials and other onsite generation or cogeneration the increase in interest in onsite generation has caused a renewed interest in netmetering as a customerowned electric utility the town of smyrna is interested in supporting renewable energy and cost reduction for its customerowners to facilitate the option of customer owned generation in a safe and reliable fashion the town has promulgated an interconnection policy technical consideration covering parallel operations of customer owned generation of less than one 1 megawatt and interconnected with the smyrna electric system herein technical considerations this net metering policy is intended to work in harmony with and support the technical considerations and to provide the administrative and financial terms of this interconnection b purpose this net metering policy is primarily intended for customers with renewablefuel electric generating facilities used to primarily offset all or part of the customers electricity requirement further it is intended to encourage private investment in renewable energy resources stimulate the economic growth of the state encourage energy independence and security and enhance the continued diversification of delawares energy resources i 9407

provided this policy applies to all customer generation of 500 kw or less which is interconnected at 25kv or below and operated in parallel with the towns power delivery system c terms of applicability 1 a proposed generator owner will make a formal application to the town for the interconnection of a generator to the town system all applications are to be sent to the towns business office the application will be prepared on an application form provided by the town two application forms are available generators 25kw or less will use the shorter application form as less technical data is needed for generating units within this size range application forms can be found in the technical considerations 2 upon approval by the town that the customers generator meet the standards set out in the technical considerations such approval shall be made available to the appropriate manufacturer upon written request for subsequent applications using some or all of the identical generating units protective devices andor systems the manufacturer may submit a copy of the approval with the application as proof that its equipment has already been approved for use on the towns system use of preapproved equipment will not eliminate any applicable requirement for a preinterconnection study to determine the suitability of the equipment for each application given the unique arrangements and characteristics of both the generator owner and town systems at the point of common coupling 3 the generator owner may connect their generation to the town system only after the interconnection application has been approved and the generation owner has received approval notification the town will make every effort to provide notification in a timely manner following the receipt of the interconnection application and all required data 4 the town will install a warning label in a conspicuous place on their electric meter or meter box and transformer to notify the town personnel that there is a generator source installed on the load side of the meter further this warning label should not be used in lieu of any additional warnings notices or safety devices to be installed by the customer or the customers installing electrician to protect the customer or customers electrician from dangerous conditions on the customers side of the meter due to the customers installation of onsite generation the warning label shall not be placed in a location that would interfere with the ability of town personnel to read the electric meter the town will provide the

at the generator owners site is the responsibility of the generator owner and at the generator owners expense l any necessary enhancements or improvements needed within the towns system andor at the customer sites to accommodate the parallel interconnection of the generator owners generation will be at the generator owners expense m the generator owner has full responsibility and liability for the safe and proper operation of their equipment and the power originating from their generator the generator owner is also responsible for synchronizing their generators with the towns system and maintaining a synchronous operation n the generator owner must immediately cease parallel operation upon notification by the town if such operation is determined to be unsafe interferes with the supply of service to other customers or interferes with the towns system maintenance or operation o the town reserves the right to specify the type of transformer connection eg deltadelta wyedelta

v>110% or v<90% specific voltage and time delay set points will be determined for each installation note trip time refers to the time between when the abnormal voltage condition occurs and the generator being disconnected from the towns electric system on three phase generator installations full three phase voltage sensing should be employed voltages must be sensed on the high side of any interface transformer if the transformer high voltage winding is ungrounded the generator owner may reconnect to the grid when the system voltage returns to normal range and is stabilized as defined in section 70186 definitions b flicker the generator owner shall not cause excessive voltage flicker on the towns system this flicker shall not exceed the borderline of irritation curve fig 103 as defined in ieee std 5191992 recommended practices and requirements for harmonic control in electric power systems see appendix 1 lower levels of flicker may be required in areas where equipment such

01 second for f<593 hz  trip in 01 second for f>605 hz  trip in 01 second for f>605 hz  trip in 01 second for f>605 hz set points taken from ieee 929 other frequency and time delay set points may be necessary for a specific installation other frequency and time delay set points may be necessary for a specific installation note trip time refers to the time between when the abnormal frequency condition occurs and the generator being disconnected from the towns electric system the generator owner may reconnect when the system frequency returns to normal range and is stabilized as defined in section 70186 definitions d harmonics nonlinear circuit elements such as inverters can produce harmonics per ieee std 519 recommended practices and requirements for harmonic control in electric power systems table 111 see appendix 1 the total harmonic distortion thd voltage shall not exceed 5% of the fundamental 60 hz frequency nor 3% of the fundamental for any individual harmonic as measured at the location where the customer interfaces with the towns system point of common coupling in addition the level of harmonic current that the customer is allowed to inject into the towns system shall not exceed that specified in table 103 in ieee std 519 see appendix 1 furthermore any communication notch should be limited as defined by table 102 in ieee std 519 see appendix 1 the preceding requirements apply to all types of generation systems the generator owner is responsible for the installation of any necessary controls or hardware to limit the voltage and current harmonics generated by his equipment to defined levels e power factor the generator must not adversely impact the power factor of the generator owner site most inverters are designed to operate close to unity power factor the operating power factor of the generator shall be contained within the limits defined in the table below generating systems with inverters up to 25 kw generating systems with inverters greater than 25 kw noninverter or rotating machine generating systems 085 lagging or leading when output exceeds 10% of inverter rating from ieee 9291999 085 lagging or leading when output exceeds 10% of inverter rating 085 lagging or leading however to the extent that a generator owners power factor at the point of common coupling falls below 09 lagging as a direct result of the installation of the generating units the generator owner must obtain install and maintain at his expense corrective apparatus that compensates for the drop in power factor caused by the installation of the generator f current in some cases directional overcurrent protection may be required to limit fault current flowing onto the grid in the event of a line fault dc inverters that are incapable of producing fault current do not require directional overcurrent protection inverter systems should not inject dc current greater than 05 percent of rated inverter output in the ac interface point under either normal or abnormal conditions g fault and line clearing the generator owner shall automatically disconnect from the towns system during electrical faults on the towns electrical system and upon loss of the towns electric source the generator owner may reconnect when the system voltage and frequency return to normal range and is stabilized as defined in section 70186 definitions detection of the loss of the towns primary electric system where the generator owner is operating in an island with other customer load becomes increasingly difficult as the level of dispersed generation on a feeder approaches the connected load for generating units 25 kw and below the overunder voltage and overunder frequency settings described previously along with the antiislandizing provisions of ieee 929ul 1746 inverters should be sufficient to satisfy this provision for units greater than 25 kw the voltage and frequency setpoints are to be adjustable with the actual setting determined by the town based on the electrical characteristics of the generator and the towns electrical system in addition additional protection such as power directional or directional overcurrent functions may be required for units 500 kw or larger a direct tripping scheme to trip the generator upon loss of the towns feeder may be required by the town this decision will be based on the saturation of distributed generation on a particular feeder circuit and in those cases where under voltage or under frequency sensing may not adequately detect loss of the town source h automatic reclosing the generator owner is responsible for protecting his equipment from the effects of switching or automatic reclosing of the towns feeder circuit the generator owner may request the town to delay high speed reclosing on the towns feeder to allow the interconnected generator sufficient time to remove itself from an islandized or deenergized feeder prior to automatic reclose since delaying the automatic reclose time degrades the level of service provided to other customers on the circuit the town will limit the automatic reclose time delays to a few seconds or less the generator owner may also request that a direct transfer trip scheme be added to remove the interconnected generator from service prior to automatic reclosing by using communications equipment between the generator site and the town similarly the generation owner may request that a synchronizing check or reclose blocking scheme be installed on the towns feeder to prevent out of phase reclosing the generation owner is responsible for all costs associated with the installation and maintenance of these requested modifications 3 control protection and safety equipment requirements specific to generators of 25 kw or less all generator owners 10 kw or less can be single phase customer owned generators greater than 10 kw must be evaluated by the town to determine if it can be single phase the following table describes
