unduly difficult expensive and not in the public interest for these reasons individuals under the age of sixteen 16 years are exempt from liability for the tax 4201 1 505 exemption from municipal

air inlet port when the shutoff valve is open the flow of water causes the float to close the air inlet port when the shutoff valve is closed the float falls and forms a check valve against back siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port d auxiliary water systemmeans any water source or system on the premises of or available to the customer except connections to other approved community water supply systems e backflowmeans a flow condition induced by a differential in pressure that causes the flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids gases or other substances

25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year the term is either a community or noncommunity water system and includes any collection treatment storage and distribution facilities under control of the operator of the system and used in connection with the system the term includes collection or pretreatment storage facilities not under such control which are used in connection with the system the term also includes a system which provides water for bottling or bulk hauling for human consumption x reduced pressure zone rpz devicemeans a minimum of two independently acting check valves together with an automatically operated pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves during normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow the pressure between these two checks shall be less than the supply pressure in case of leakage of either check valve the differential relief valve by discharging to the atmosphere shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks at less than the supply pressure the unit must include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the device and each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks  528  y service connectionmeans the terminalend of a service line from the public water supply system if a meter is installed at the end of the service then the service connection means the downstream end of the meter z system hazardmeans a condition posing an actual or potential threat of damage to the physical properties of the public water system or the consumers potable water system  530  part vii chapter 3recommended crossconnection control and backflow prevention devices 30general in selecting for use the devices outlined in this section it is vital that the degree of protection provided be commensurate with the degree of hazard present it is also important that the limitations of each device beunderstood since the degree of protection provided will depend on the type of backflow prevention device and the maintenance program employed acceptable backflow prevention devices used for crossconnection control are as follows a air gap b reduced pressure zone devices c double check valve assembly  rpzds and dcvas should conform to awwa standard c506 31air gap an air gap separation provides a complete physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water supply line faucet plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level rim of an open or nonpressure receiving vessel an acceptable airgap separation shall be at least double the diameter of the supply line in no case shall the air gap be less than 1 inch see figure vii1 advantages properly designed and installed air gap installations provide the maximum degree of protection against backflow limitations air gap separations can be defeated by the thoughtless addition of a hose that in effect extends the discharge end of the pipe to a point below the highest possible water level of the fixture under some conditions the cost of an air gap separation may be high when compared to a mechanical backflow prevention device air gap separation usually deprives the water consumer of the use of the water pressure in the main 32 reduced pressure zone devices rpzd these devices consist of two spring loaded check valves operating in series and a spring loaded diaphragm activated differential pressure relief valve located in the zone between the check valves see figure v112 two 2 tightly closing shutoff valves and four 4 test cocks complete the assembly these devices will indicate leakage or both check valves or the relief valve by the discharge of water from the relief valve port this factor is an important advantage over the double check valve assembly advantages the rpzds when periodically tested and properly maintained may be used for backflow protection in situations where it would be extremely difficult to provide an air gap separation between two systems  531  distance

from backflow due to both backpressure or backsiphonage limitations rpzds are mechanical devices that require periodic testing and maintenance pressure loss s may be expected to average between 10 and 30 psi depending upon the size and flow rate of the device rpzds should not be installed below ground level must be protected from freezing and provided with adequate space to facilitate maintenance and testing 33 double check valve assembly dcvas the dcva consists of two independently acting check valves mounted in series with two tightly closing shutoff valves and four test cocks see figure v113 advantages the primary advantage of a dcva is that when its two check valves are in the wide open position there is a relative little resistance to flow the head loss device ranges between 3 and 11 psi depending on the rate of flow and diameter of pipe dcvas provide protection against backflow due to both backsiphonage or back pressure the dcva may be less expensive to install than an air gap or rpzd limitations dcvas have the inherent weakness of possible failure without giving exterior indication that a failure has occurred dcvas are mechanical devices that require periodic inspection

stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough of new holland and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface
