health safety and general welfare of its citizenry art 1 11121991 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in hazards to property health and safety and may disrupt commerce and governmental services also this inundation can result in extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base which adversely affects the public health safety and general welfare b these potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1 b 11121991 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions

specific architectural style and character or that consist of uniformly high value dwellings relative to the value of a standard manufactured home in these special neighborhoods the citys

the development of accessory residential units to provide a semiindependent living environment for family members who require special care and support from the primary household such a unit would

telecommunication towers antennas and satellite dishes a purpose of regulations the public has a legitimate interest and concern in the placement and appearance of telecommunication towers antennas and satellite dishes under the telecommunications act of 199 where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate right of businesses to exercise free trade the city desires access to advanced technology to serve its businesses and citizens but not at the expense of the communitys overall appearance and public image the city seeks to impose sensible controls on telecommunication facilities in order to maintain the aesthetic character and charm of the community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and uncontrolled proliferation and placement of wireless facilities new telecommunications towers should not create a cluttered landscape or dominate the communitys natural skyline as it is viewed from the primary highway entrances to the city to that end the city desires to partner with telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services

requirement 4 appearance and view protection all proposed communication facilities with the exception of proposed antennas that will be colocated on a preexisting tower shall be attractively camouflaged disguised or hidden in a manner that it will blend into the surrounding environment to the greatest extent possible examples of proper camouflaging include designing a tower to resemble a tree designing a monopole to look like and function as a flagpole or freestanding sign support hiding an antenna within a church steeple or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of a tower or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the proposed communication facility site it shall be the burden of the applicant to document and prove that a proposed communication facility cannot be effectively camouflaged before approval of a noncamouflaged structure may be permitted by the city in such instances the applicant shall explore alternative means of minimizing the visual impact of the antenna such as installing it onto an existing telephone pole streetlight or building rooftop rather than erecting a new tower specifically for the proposed antenna however in no instance shall a noncamouflaged communication facility be approved for a residential property 5 signs prohibited no signs or other forms of advertising including signs displaying the name of the owner or user of the tower or antenna may be attached to or depicted on a communication facility unless the proposed facility is a new monopole specifically camouflaged and approved to

telecommunication need in the area of the proposed site this colocation requirement may be waived by the city where the proposed antenna would create an excessively cluttered appearance on the available colocation site thereby drawing greater visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing obstruction to scenic views and vistas from the area and the proposed new antenna would be less visible or intrusive on the surrounding area if effectively camouflaged on an alternate site 11 setback requirements all proposed communication facilities and structures including guys and accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which they will be sited however all proposed tower compounds that will be located on a

the tower will contain no more than five antennas if the application is approved in addition the supporting equipment for the proposed antenna shall not require the construction of any new freestanding structures on the tower compound b any antenna and associated cables and equipment that will be sited in an existing structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this section not a nonconforming structure and where after installation the antenna and all supporting equipment will be completely enclosed by the exterior walls of the structure or completely screened from public view at any point on the land within 2000 feet of the proposed antenna an example of such a scenario would be the placement of an antenna within the steeple of a church or the dome of a farm silo the addition of the antenna and supporting equipment to the existing conforming structure shall not require the construction of an addition to house the communication facilities however interior modifications to the structure may be permitted as part of the approval by the enforcement officer 2 review and approval exclusively by city council the city council shall have the authority to review and approve the following specific types of communication facilities and tower compounds subject to the conduct of a public hearing but without the need for a formal recommendation from the planning commission a any antenna and associated cables and equipment that will be installed on a colocation site that does not fall within the approval authority of the enforcement officer as specified in subsection e1a of this section b any new antenna not including a tower that will be attached to an existing structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this section not a nonconforming structure but that would not otherwise fall within the approval authority of the enforcement officer as specified in subsection e1b of this section c any new monopole not greater than 30 feet in height and located in a nonresidential zoning district that is camouflaged or disguised in such a way that it cannot be immediately recognized as an antenna support d any new antenna or tower to be located on property owned leased or otherwise controlled by the city and located within a nonresidential zoning district 3 review and approval by city council upon recommendation from planning commission all applications not subject to review and approval by the enforcement officer in accordance with subsection e1 of this section or review and approval exclusively by the city council in accordance with subsection e2 of this section shall be subject to review and public hearings by both the planning commission and the city council the planning commission shall review the

requirements of the regulations andor the failure of the application to satisfy specific basic requirements and design considerations outlined in subsection d of this section if the enforcement officer fails to render a decision on the application within the required 31 days then aspects of the application subject to review and approval by the enforcement officer shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further consideration by the city however the city council may grant an extension to the 31 day deadline not to exceed an additional 31 days due to extended illness or absence of the enforcement officer during the required review and approval period or the submission of an application that is too large or extensive to be reviewed by existing staff resources within the prescribed time frame on the date that the enforcement officers review period ends any remaining portions of the application not subject to approval or denial by the enforcement officer shall be submitted to the city council andor planning commission for action as may be applicable the forwarded application shall be accompanied by a written report from the enforcement officer regarding his

or condominium development projects within any regular zoning district where such uses may be permitted shall be governed by this guidelines and requirements contained in this section 1 statement of intent the purpose of this section is to establish special standards for the design and review of development projects containing townhouse and condominium dwellings it is expected that townhouse and condominium developments will offer a higher standard of amenity than a traditional residential subdivision to compensate for the higher residential density opportunities afforded by these special development standards in addition the development design flexibility created by these standards should be used to protect sensitive natural features within or adjacent to the development site such as rivers and streams lakes or lake shoreline rare or endangered species colonies or habitats or large stands or tracts of mature trees or forest areas such natural features or resources add substantial value to the development but are often difficult to protect under traditional subdivision practices although architectural design of individual buildings is not specifically regulated by this section the city expects developers of townhouse and condominium projects to design buildings and utilize exterior materials and color schemes that will help the project blend with or complement the predominant architectural style of the surrounding neighborhood and to minimize the appearance and intrusion of the higher permitted residential densities on the natural environment neighboring properties and the overall setting of the project 2 basic development requirements for all townhouses and condominiums the following basic design requirements and dimensional standards shall be

development 3 review and approval since both townhouse and condominium developments result in the subdivision of land into parcels or units for sale or transfer of ownership they must be approved as subdivisions therefore all townhouse and condominium developments must be reviewed and approved by the planning commission in accordance with the review and approval procedures of the city subdivision regulations prior to the issuance of a zoning permit to the extent that the development standards andor review considerations of this section conflict with the corresponding requirements of the city subdivision regulations as they may be applied to townhouse or condominium projects the requirements contained in this chapter shall supersede and govern all other procedures and requirements of the
