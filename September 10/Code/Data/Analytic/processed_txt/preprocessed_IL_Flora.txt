areas undergoing subdivision development and the construction of related improvements this code requires the use of specific erosion control measures sediment from soil erosion can reduce the channel capacity of waterways thereby limiting their use for many beneficial purposes and resulting in increased chances of flooding a risk to public health and safety sediment can also clog sewers and ditches pollute and silt rivers streams lakes and reservoirs and necessitate costly repairs to gullies washed out fills and embankments in order to help safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare the provisions of this section guide regulate and control the design construction use and maintenance of any development which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated within the city of flora any person partnership or corporation convicted of violating any of the provisions of the erosion control provisions of this code shall be required to restore the affected site to the condition existing prior to commission of the violation or to reimburse the city of flora for the expense of such restoration bgeneral provisions 1 whenever feasible natural contours should be followed as closely as possible in areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills might otherwise be required so that the design of every subdivision is consistent with the natural limitations presented by topography and soil and so to create the least potential for soil erosion 2 wherever possible neutral vegetation should be retained and protected and areas immediately adjacent to neutral watercourses should be left undisturbed 3 the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 4 during development the subdividerdeveloper shall install temporary erosion control measures to prevent siltation of adjacent streams roads and property 5 the subdividerdeveloper shall install and maintain appropriate permanent devices such as sediment basins debris basins desilting basins silt traps filters riprap or energy dissipaters in order to prevent long term erosion and siltation and to remove sediment from runoff waters 6 the subdividerdeveloper shall select erosion and sedimentation control measures based upon an assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and upon an evaluation of the risk cost and benefits involved 7 in the design of the erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 8 provision shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion 9 permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development and in no case exceed more than ninety 90 days cpenalties 1 any person who violates disobeys omits neglects refuses to comply with or who resists enforcement of any provisions of the erosion control sections shall be guilty of a civil offense punishable by a fine only of not less than fifty dollars $5000 nor more than five hundred
