qualifying facilities and projects in order for a project to come under the ppea it must meet the definition of a qualifying project the ppea contains a broad definition of qualifying project that includes public buildings and facilities of all types  for example 1 an education facility including but not limited to a school building including any stadium or other facility primarily used for

should be prepared simply and economically providing a concise description of the proposers capabilities to complete the proposed qualifying project and the benefits to be derived from the project by the public entity project benefits to be considered are those occurring during the construction renovation expansion or improvement phase and during the life cycle of the project proposals also should include a comprehensive scope of work and a financial plan for the project containing enough detail to allow an analysis by the town of the financial feasibility of the proposed project for specific applications the town may request in writing clarification to the submission the county may establish criteria by which the proposer may provide clarification to the submission the cost analysis of a proposal should not be linked solely to the financing plan as the town may determine to finance the project available means the ppea is intended to encourage proposals from the private sector that offer the provision of private financing in support of the proposed public project which may include commensurate risk to the private operator but may also benefit the operator approaches to project financing development and use however while substantial private sector involvement is encouraged qualifying facilities will still be devoted primarily to public use and typically involve facilities essential to the public health safety and welfare accordingly the town shall continue to exercise full and proper due diligence in the evaluation and selection of operators for these projects in this regard the qualifications capabilities resources and other attributes of a prospective operator and its whole team shall be carefully examined for every project in addition operators proposing

with evaluating the proposed qualifying project direct costs may include i the cost of staff time required to process evaluate review and respond to the proposal and ii the outofpocket costs of the town for attorneys consultants and financial advisors the proposal fee may cover all or part of the initial review process for example the town may require a proposal fee in an amount sufficient to

submitting the proposal the town is authorized and obligated to protect only confidential proprietary information and thus will not protect any portion of a proposal from disclosure if the entire proposal has been designated confidential by the proposer without reasonably differentiating between the proprietary and nonproprietary information contained therein upon receipt of a request that

of surface water means the effective conveyance of storm and other surface waters from the onsite stormwater management facilities into an 1 natural watercourse ie a stream with incised channel bed

system shall be designed 1 to honor natural drainage divides 2 to account for both off site and on site surface waters 3 to convey such waters to a natural watercourse ie a natural watercourse at the natural elevation or an existing or proposed stormwater management facility and 4 to discharge the surface waters into a natural watercourse at the natural elevation or into an existing facility of adequate capacity d the drainage system shall be designed such that properties over which the surface waters are conveyed from the development site to discharge points are not subject to increased erosion or increased flooding e concentrated surface waters shall not be discharged on adjoining property unless an easement expressly authorizing such discharge has been granted by the owner of the affected land or unless the discharge is into a natural watercourse or other appropriate discharge point as set for the above f the owner or applicantdevelopment may continue to discharge storm water which has not been concentrated into a lower lying property if the following three conditions are met 1 the peak runoff rate after development does not exceed the predevelopment peak runoff rate for the 1year storm and 10year storm 2 the increase in runoff volume caused by the development will not have an adverse impact such as erosion or flooding on the lower lying property any increase in runoff volume will be analyzed and meet the requirement of the energy balance 513 revised december 2019 dcrvswcb0301212 equation as defined by the channel protection criterion of of the new swm

downstream watercourse may be modified so that it can handle the twoyear postdevelopment flow provided however that if the applicantdeveloper choose to install a storm drainage system the system shall be designed in accordance with these regulations for such systems j if off site downstream construction and easements are necessary to obtain an adequate drainage outfall no plans shall receive final approval until such storm drainage easements extending to the nearest natural and well defined adequate stabilized watercourse or adequate manmade drainage channel or pipe have obtained and recorded

the flood plain limit into an adequate watercourse channel leading to the main streambed rather than disturb the flood plain by extending the storm sewer 2 if an adequate watercourse channel does not exist the only alternative is to discharge into the main streambed 3 in either case energy dissipation devices are required l the requirements of town of warrenton relating to erosion and sedimentation control and the further requirements for protection of streambeds by detention of surface waters 514 revised december 2019 dcrvswcb0301212 set forth in these regulations must be

impacts resulting from higher rates and volumes of flow that might occur during construction o in cases where the drainage plans of a proposed development do not satisfy these minimum requirements because necessary off site facilities or improvements are lacking the applicantdeveloper shall delay development until the necessary off site facilities or improvements are constructed or other arrangements are made which are suitable to the director of public works in such event the plat or plans if otherwise satisfactory will be approved when the requirements of this satisfied

metal substances however it comes either prepainted in the synthetic acrylic andor vinyl coating explained above for a potential twentyyear lifetime of the bakedon coating or unpainted if left bare this luminous galvanized metal has a bright and glaring metallic finish which also does not replicate the appearance of historic or contributing standingseam metal roofs as of october 201 terne the most widely used paintable roof material is no longer being manufactured making unpainted or bare standing seam roofs less practical to obtain when formed onsite prepaintedfinished galvalume is the closest available match to traditional standing seam roofs and should be considered appropriate when applied per the guidelines similarly other prepainted metals should be considered appropriate when applied consistent with the guidelines galvalume galvalume is a steel product with an aluminumzinc alloy coating the coating is 45 percent zinc and 55 percent aluminum visible crystals are closer together than galvanized steel creating a smoother appearance the product is also available as galvalume plus which has a thin clear acrylic coating prepainted finishes are available or it may be field painted the aluminum zincalloy offers excellent corrosion protection however the product is not recommended for agricultural applications or around concrete and mortar terne coated copper and

grayish patina will vary based upon environmental conditions terne coated copper may be formed by the same methods as traditional copper terne coated stainless steel is stainless steel coated with the same 5050 zinctin alloy by a hot dipping process and the surface finish and weathering will be the same as the terne coated copper terne coated steel can be formed onsite but it does however have
