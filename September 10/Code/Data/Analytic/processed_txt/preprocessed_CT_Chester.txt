telecommunications services these new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers this requires that the town of chester regulate these ivireless communication s stem facilities in a different manner than conventionaj television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances a number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the town of chester and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers the intent of this proposed regulation is to update the town of chesters zoning regulations to comply with the telecommunications act of 1996 and provide for the establishment and or expansion of cellular telephone mobile radio and personal communication systems vddiin the town of chester while protecting neighborhoods and mirlimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunications facilities design siting and screening more specifically this regulation has been developed in order to maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the community encourage providers to colocate their facilities on a single site  site facilities below visually prominent ridge lines  minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas  encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities  protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication towers  avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower structures  provide for the need of the town of chester a public health and safety 76 town of chester zoning
