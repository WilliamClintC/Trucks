honor the historical development pattern and character of downtown fruita while many communities attempt to create or recreate an urban downtown of their own fruita already has a downtown containing a mixture of historic buildings and contemporary buildings a large central plaza and attractive residential neighborhoods in and around the downtown area fruitas mixed use zones are intended to support traditional downtown and village commercial development new development and redevelopment should support a walkable and attractive area with shopping restaurants residences parks and civic office and other employment centers the building design standards draw on historic elements of the downtown while allowing for a contemporary interpretation of fruitas history it is not the intent of the city of fruita to create an architectural theme or to freeze time but rather to ensure that new buildings remodels and redevelopment fit within the context of their historic surroundings as applicable and support compact walkable districts the key elements of mixed use development are summarized as follows 1 architecture based on local vocabulary of building styles and elements including compatibility with historic structures where applicable 2 building height and articulated facades that create a sense of street enclosure at a human scale 3 provide appropriate design standards for the downtown

honor traditional neighborhood development principles consistent with the desired character and form of fruita as expressed by the revised 8312018 17141 land use plan while many communities attempt to create traditional neighborhoods fruita already has traditional neighborhoods the original town plat contains a variety of housing types in both historic and contemporary structures many with front porches fruitas historic neighborhoods contain both small and large lots some with alley access and street tree planter strips and most within walking distance of centrally located open spaces schools churches and other community services however some areas outside the historic town plat have developed in a manner that is inconsistent with the above traditional neighborhood design principles the design standards in this section are intended to guide compatible infill development and promote the creation of new traditional neighborhoods where new subdivisions are proposed it is not the intent of the city of fruita create an architectural theme or to freeze time but rather to ensure that new buildings and remodels fit within the context of their historic surroundings as applicable and support the development of new compact walkable neighborhoods with a variety of housing the key elements of this summarized as follows 1 new development and redevelopment should support walkable and

fairly and accurately delineate the need for additional public services or facilities which will be generated by the ownerdevelopers proposed development or improvement and shall include consideration of the following criteria a whether the proposed public improvements or facilities would be required but for the ownerdevelopers proposed development or improvement  b whether and to what extent it is reasonably likely that other developments or residents thereof will utilize the public facility or improvement in question  c whether existing public facilities or services can adequately serve the proposed development or improvement without the additional expense to construct expand or improve the public facility or service in question  and revised 8312018 17181 land use the conclusions of such

hand and the amount or extent of such total cost which is attributable to or is caused or generated by the proposed development or improvement on the other hand the extent of the dedication or amount of the fee due from the ownerdeveloper must bear roughly the same proportion to the total cost of providing the public services or facilities in question as the need for such facilities or services generated by the ownerdevelopers development or improvement bears to the general populations need for or use of the facilities or services 2 the ownerdeveloper shall request such an individualized study or report at the preapplication conference prior to the submittal of a subdivision sketch plan application planned unit development concept plan application or similar application and shall pay

criteria set forth in shall be guided by the overriding principle that an impact fee or public dedication requirement is unfair disproportionate and unconstitutional if it imposes a burden on an ownerdeveloper which in equity and fairness should be borne by the public in general however an impact fee or dedication will be required in compliance with all existing constitutional requirements when the failure of the ownerdeveloper to provide the dedication or impact fee would fail to remedy impacts to the city other local governments or to the general public created or exacerbated by the

provided that the constructed improvements are of general benefit to the city of fruita and general public as determined by the city and are not required solely because of the development b for constructed improvements meeting the provisions of subsection a above where the construction cost exceeds the assessed impact fee developers are eligible for additional credit against impact fees assessable at a future phase or filing or for reimbursement by the city from previously collected impact fees credits for the cost of constructed improvements may be carried over or transferred to successive filings or phases within the same development but in no case shall credits be carried over or transferred to a different development or project revised 8312018 17184 land use in all cases

if a development approval expires without commencement of construction or development the ownerdeveloper shall be entitled to a refund without interest of impact fees paid unless otherwise agreed by the city and the ownerdeveloper except that the city shall retain one 1 percent of the fee to offset a portion of the cost of collection and refund the ownerdeveloper must submit a letter requesting a refund to the community development department within thirty 30 days following expiration of the development approval granted b unless otherwise provided in this title any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten 10 years from the date the impact fees were paid shall upon application of the then current land owner be returned to such land

following expiration of such ten 10 year period     public parks open spaces and trails impact feededication a the city of fruita has determined that new residential developments cause financial impacts to the citys public park open space and trail systems necessitating capital improvements that would not be required without such development the city has adopted a parks open space and trails master plan which provides general policy guidelines and planning recommendations for provision of public parks open space and trails the purpose of this section is to implement and be consistent with the citys master plan specifically the parks open space and trails section of the master plan by requiring all new residential development to contribute a proportionate share of the public parks open space and trails necessary to accommodate any impacts or need for such facilities dedication of land andor fees in lieu of land dedications the dedication of land andor the payment of the cash equivalent will enable the city to provide parks in the proper location and of the proper size to serve the citizens of the city this regulation also is adopted to help discourage the proliferation of small parcels tracts and outlots that are ostensibly created as open space andor parks but are not sized located or maintained as functional sites for these uses consistent with this with of this title every residential development which increases the number of dwelling units above that which was approved as of the effective date of this title shall include a dedication of land to the city or other entity as determined by the city council to be used for public parks open space andor trails andor payment of a public parks open space andor trails fee in lieu of such dedication as provided herein accessory dwelling units are not subject to this fee b amount of land dedication required land for public parks open space and trails shall be based on the adopted level of service standard as identified in the parks open space and trails master plan post plan as follows for every 1000 residents the following parks and trail areas are needed to meet the level of service standard identified

reimburse the school district for sums expended to acquire such property the amount of the sld fee shall be based on a methodology which takes into account the student generation rates of new residential development the quantity of land required to build new school facilities on a per pupil basis and the anticipated cost of acquiring suitable school lands in the school district to expand existing school facilities and construct new school facilities to accommodate new residential development without decreasing current levels of educational services 2 at the time sld fees are initially

suitable school lands within the school district x student generation fee factor of 023  sld fee per dwelling unit for example if the average cost of suitable school lands is fifteen thousand dollars $1500000 per acre the sld fee per dwelling unit would be fifteen thousand dollars $1500000 times x 023 or three hundred fortyfive dollars $34500 4 the student generation fee factor may also be modified at the hearing provided that either the school district gives notice to the city council that it requests such a modification at least thirty 30 days prior to the hearing or the city council

developments and expansion modification or redevelopment of existing developments cause financial impacts to the citys transportation system necessitating capital improvements that would not be required without such development these impacts include wear and tear on existing pavements requiring rehabilitation or reconstruction of existing streets increased traffic volumes requiring widening to improve traffic flow and provide better turning movements additional traffic control devices and safety concerns associated with the interaction of vehicular traffic with pedestrian and bicycle traffic b the city has further determined that typically no single development creates enough traffic to warrant construction of offsite improvements based strictly on a traffic capacity revised 8312018 17194 land use or a required level of service analysis however each development incrementally depletes existing capacity and incrementally decreases the level of service the cumulative impacts from new developments results in unacceptable depletions in capacity and level of service thereby requiring the expenditure of capital funds for improvements c the city has also determined that irrespective of a capacity or level of service analysis for traffic flow construction of facilities to facilitate safe turning movements for vehicles and for the safe movement of bicycles and pedestrians are reasonable requirements for urban streets and shall be accounted for in any impact fee calculation d consistent with the citys need to plan for engineer and construct transportation improvements resulting from the cumulative impacts of new development including bikeways and sidewalks the citys general policy is that the proportional impact resulting from a new development be paid by the ownerdeveloper and consistent with the provisions of this a transportation impact fee shall be assessed for new development 1 for developments for which a site specific traffic impact analysis is conducted pursuant to of this title the transportation impact fee shall be calculated by the city based upon the following criteria a an evaluation of the sitespecific traffic impact analysis which shall describe the percentage impact of the development on the local street network in the vicinity of the development the traffic impact analysis shall include an estimate of twenty 20 year future traffic volumes and use a passby traffic growth rate of two 2 percent or less unless otherwise approved by the city b estimated costs of future improvements on local streets and intersections plus a calculated pro rata cost for improvements to regional roads the scope of future local improvements shall be based on the long term needs of the city as determined by the city consistent with long range planning documents and irrespective of a strict level of service analysis improvements may include but are not limited to curb gutter and sidewalk  bikeways  traffic signals  pavement widening replacement or rehabilitation  traffic calming devices  and traffic control devices the scope of future regional road improvements and estimated costs thereof shall be determined from current and future regional planning studies including the transportation impact fee study prepared for mesa county by duncan & associates and dated september 2002 the duncan study c the roughly proportional impacts from the development on individual local streets andor intersections multiplied by the total estimated costs for these improvements plus a calculated pro rata amount for regional roads shall equal the total transportation impact fee revised 8312018 17195 land use the base rate for residential subdivisions with single family and duplex dwelling units for which no traffic impact analysis is performed shall be three thousand two hundred dollars $320000 per dwelling unit the base rate may be adjusted by resolution of the city council annually for inflation based on the change in the colorado department of transportations construction cost index for multifamily dwelling units in excess of two units the base rate of three thousand two hundred dollars $320000 shall be multiplied by a factor of 069 per unit for the fee per dwelling unit said fees are based upon traffic impact analysis performed according to subsection d1 of this adjusted to reflect recent actual costs incurred on local road projects the base rate may be adjusted by resolution of the city council annually for inflation based on the change in the colorado department of transportations construction cost index 3

structure that does not involve a change in the square footage of the structure shall not require a new transportation impact fee unless the use requires a site plan review conditional use permit or rezone in which case a traffic study may be required and a transportation impact fee may be imposed based on the net increase in traffic alternatively the transportation impact fee assessed shall be calculated based on the difference in table values for the new verses the previous use c in many instances a particular structure may include auxiliary uses associated with the primary land use for example  in addition to the actual production of goods manufacturing facilities usually also have office warehouse research and other associated functions the impact fees generally are assessed based on the primary land use if the applicant can document that a secondary land use accounts for over twentyfive 25 percent of the gross floor area of the structure and that the secondary use is not assumed in the trip generation or other impact data for the primary use then the impact fees may be assessed based on the disaggregated square footage of the primary and secondary land use d for an expansion redevelopment or modification of an existing development the fee shall be based on the net increase in the impact of the new use andor square footage as compared to the previous use andor square footage e in the event that the proposed change of land use type redevelopment or modification results in a net decrease in the fee for the new use or development as compared to the previous use or development there shall be no refund of impact fees previously paid f for fees expressed per one thousand 1000 square feet the square footage shall be determined according to gross floor area measured from the outside surface of exterior walls and excluding unfinished basements and enclosed parking areas the fees shall be prorated and assessed based on actual floor area not on the floor area rounded to the nearest one thousand 1000 square feet 5 all transportation impact fees shall be deposited in a fund created by the city for transportation improvements until used to construct actual capital facilities and improvements on impacted local streets and intersections or allocated to regional road improvements consistent with the total amount of deposited impact fees may be used at the discretion of the city to construct improvements to the local street network or to regional street projects so long as the fees are used to perform improvements to streets andor intersections

2 to five 5 years after the construction of the new street in order to extend the life of asphalt streets in new developments and reduce initial maintenance costs to the city of fruita a chip and seal impact fee will be assessed for each new development that provides additional constructed public streets the chip and seal impact fee changes annually and is calculated based on the current square yard bid cost of chip and seal work as contracted by the city multiplied by the total number of square yards of new asphalt for dedicated city maintained streets interior to a development as shown in the approved schedule of improvements contained in the applicable subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement   drainage impact fee a the city of fruita had prepared a

which has also been adopted as a component of the citys master plan b consistent with the justifications and formula found in the swmmp a drainage impact fee shall be assessed for all new developments when the calculated runoff volume andor flow rate from developed conditions exceeds the runoff volume andor flow rate from historic predevelopment conditions a drainage impact fee which the city council has determined is roughly proportional to the infrastructure impacts caused by the development shall be calculated according to the following formula drainage impact fee $   b x c100dc100h x

the physical properties of soils  amendments are mixed into the soil mulches are placed on the soil surface  the best soil amendments increase waterand nutrientholding capacity and improve aeration and water infiltration  wood products can tie up nitrogen in the soil  sphagnum peat is superior to colorado mountain peat  when using biosolids choose grade 1 biosolids a soil amendment is any material added to a soil to improve its physical properties such as water retention permeability water infiltration drainage aeration and structure the goal is to provide a better environment for roots to do its work an amendment must be thoroughly mixed into the soil if it is merely buried its effectiveness is reduced and it will interfere with water and air movement and root growth amending a soil is not the same thing as mulching although many mulches also are used as amendments a mulch is left on the soil surface its purpose is to reduce evaporation and runoff inhibit weed growth and create an attractive appearance mulches also moderate soil temperature helping to warm soils in the spring and cool them in the summer mulches may be incorporated into the soil as amendments after they have decomposed to the point that they no longer serve their purpose organic vs inorganic amendments there are two broad categories of soil amendments organic and inorganic organic amendments come from something that is or was alive inorganic amendments on the other hand are either mined or manmade organic amendments include sphagnum peat wood chips grass clippings straw compost manure biosolids sawdust and wood ash inorganic amendments include vermiculite perlite tire chunks pea gravel and sand not all of the above are recommended by colorado state university these are merely examples wood ash an organic amendment is high in both ph and salt it can magnify common colorado soil problems and should not be used as a soil amendment dont add sand to clay soil this creates a soil structure similar to concrete organic amendments increase soil organic matter content and offer many benefits organic matter improves soil aeration water infiltration and both waterand nutrientholding capacity many organic amendments contain plant nutrients and act as organic fertilizers organic matter also is an important energy source for bacteria fungi and earthworms that live in the soil application rates if your soil has less than 3 percent organic matter then apply 3 cubic yards of your chosen organic amendment per 1000 square feet to avoid salt buildup do not apply more than this retest your soil before deciding whether to add more soil amendment wood products wood products can tie up nitrogen in the soil and cause nitrogen deficiency in plants microorganisms in the soil use nitrogen to break down the wood within a few months the nitrogen is released and again becomes available to plants this hazard is greatest with sawdust because it has a greater surface area than wood chips if you plan to apply wood chips or sawdust you may need to apply nitrogen fe if you plan to apply wood chips or sawdust you may need to apply nitrogen fertilizer at the same time to avoid nitrogen deficiency sphagnum peat vs mountain peat sphagnum peat is an excellent soil amendment especially for sandy soils which will retain more water after sphagnum peat application sphagnum peat is generally acid ie low ph and can help gardeners grow plants that require a more acidic soil colorado mountain peat is not as good a soil amendment it often is too fine in texture and generally has a higher ph mountain peat is mined from highaltitude wetlands that will take hundreds of years to rejuvenate if ever this mining is extremely disruptive to hydrologic cycles and mountain ecosystems sphagnum peat is harvested from bogs in canada and the northern united states the bogs can be revegetated after harvest and grow back relatively quickly in this moist environment are biosolids safe biosolids are byproducts of sewage treatment they may be found alone or composted with leaves or other organic materials the primary concerns about biosolids are heavy metal content pathogen levels and salts to avoid excessive levels of heavy metals and to ensure that pathogens have been killed always choose a grade 1 biosolid while grade 1 biosolids are acceptable for food gardens do not use them on root crops because they will come in direct contact with the edible portion of the plant do not use biosolids below grade 1 manure vs compost fresh manure can harm plants due to elevated ammonia levels to avoid this problem use only aged manure at least six months old pathogens are another potential problem with fresh manure especially on vegetable gardens compost manure for at least two heating cycles at 130 to 140 degrees f to kill any pathogens before applying the manure to vegetable gardens most home composting systems do not sustain temperatures at this level homecomposted products containing manure are best used in flower gardens shrub borders and other nonfood gardens see fact sheets  preventing e coli from garden to plate and  composting yard waste during composting ammonia gas is lost from the manure therefore nitrogen levels may be lower in composted manure than in raw manure on the other hand the phosphorus and potassium concentrations will be higher in composted manure modify fertilizer practices accordingly salt levels also will be higher in composted manure than in raw manure if salt levels are already high in your garden soil do not apply manures other composts are available that are made primarily from leaf or wood products alone or in combination with manures or biosolids factors to consider when choosing an amendment there are at least four factors to consider in selecting a soil amendment  how long the amendment will last in the soil  soil texture  soil salinity and plant sensitivities to salts and  salt content and ph of the amendment laboratory tests can determine the salt content ph and organic matter of organic amendments the quality of bulk organic amendments for largescale landscape uses can then be determined longevity of the amendment the amendment you choose depends on your goals  are you trying to improve soil physical properties quickly choose an amendment that decomposes rapidly  do you want a longlasting improvement to your soil choose an amendment that decomposes slowly  do you want a quick improvement that lasts a long time choose a combination of amendments table 1 decomposition rate of various amendments amendment decomposition rate grass clippings manures rapid decomposition days to weeks composts moderate decomposition about six months wood chips redwood cedar hardwood bark peat slow decomposition possibly years soil texture soil texture or the way a soil feels reflects the size of the soil particles sandy soils have large soil particles and feel gritty clay soils have small soil particles and feel sticky both sandy soils and clay soils are a challenge for gardeners loam soils have the ideal mixture of different size soil particles when amending sandy soils the goal is to increase the soils ability to hold moisture and store nutrients to achieve this use organic amendments that are well decomposed like composts or aged manures with clay soils the goal is to improve soil aggregation increase porosity and permeability and improve aeration and drainage fibrous amendments like peat wood chips tree bark or straw are most effective in this situation use tables 2 and 3 for more specific recommendations because sandy soils have low water retention choose an amendment with high water retention like peat compost or vermiculite clay soils have low permeability so choose an amendment with high permeability like wood chips hardwood bark or perlite vermiculite is not a good choice for clay soils because of its high water retention table 2 permeability and water retention of various soil types soil texture permeability water retention sand high low loam medium medium silt low high clay low high table 3 permeability and water retention of various soil amendments amendment permeability water retention fibrous peat wood chips hardwood bark lowmedium high high very high lowmedium lowmedium humus compost aged manure lowmedium lowmedium mediumhigh medium inorganic vermiculite perlite high high high low soil salinity and plant sensitivity to salts some forms of compost and manures can be high in salts avoid these amendments in soils that are already high in salts above 3 mmhoscm or when growing plants that are sensitive to salts raspberry strawberry bean carrot onion kentucky bluegrass maple pine viburnum and many other landscape plants are salt sensitive in such cases choose sphagnum peat or ground leaves instead of compost or manures salt content and ph of the amendment always beware of salts in soil amendments high salt content and high ph are common problems in colorado soils therefore avoid amendments that are high in salts or that have a high ph amendments high in salts andor ph include wood ash colorado mountain peat and composted manures an amendment with up to 10 mmhoscm total salts is acceptable if well mixed into lowsalt soils less than 1 mmhoscm amendments with a salt content greater than 10 mmhoscm are questionable choose a lowsalt amendment for soils testing high in salts sphagnum peat and compost made from purely plant sources are low in salts and are good choices for amending colorado soils ask for an analysis of the organic amendments that you are considering and choose your amendments wisely if no analysis is available test a small amount of the amendment before purchasing a large quantity

maintenance costs revised  17315 land use of the following principles is an elaboration on one or more of these four 4 factors the principles are not intended as absolute criteria since instances may appear where certain principles conflict the principles should therefore be used as guides to proper systems layout a ensure vehicular and pedestrian access and provide utility access the primary function of local streets is to serve abutting properties street widths placement of sidewalks patterns of streets and the number of intersections are related to safe and efficient access to abutting lands b control access to collectors and arterials local circulation systems and land development patterns should not detract from the efficiency of peripheral collector and arterial streets ideally land development should occur so that no lots require direct access to collector or arterial routes the number of access points between the local circulation system and the arterial system should be minimized intersections along collector and arterial routes should be properly spaced for efficient signalization and traffic flow c discourage speeding residential streets should be designed to discourage fast movement of vehicular traffic and incorporate traffic calming measures where appropriate d interconnectivity all developments should be planned to provide both vehicle and pedestrianbicycle connectivity to adjacent undeveloped properties and to the existing circulation system wherever possible street stubs to adjacent parcels and connections for pedestrianbicycle paths shall be incorporated into the design of the development   minimum requirements for local circulation systems in addition to the planning principles outlined in the minimum requirements of this apply to the design of new streets additional specific requirements can also be found in the mesa county standard specification for road and bridge construction where conflicts exist between this provisions
