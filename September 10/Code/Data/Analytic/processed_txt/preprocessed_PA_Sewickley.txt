predevelopment discharge rates for the specified design events peak flows should be computed using the methods included in of the padep stormwater management bmp manual a in order to protect and improve water quality a riparian buffer easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land development that encompasses a riparian buffer the intent of this chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve stream water quality the riparian buffer is intended to slow overland flow to the stream presence of native grasses trees and shrubs allowing infiltrationgroundwater recharge  causing deposition of sediment nutrients pesticides and other pollutants in the buffer rather than in the stream  and reducing erosion by providing stream bank stabilization the trees provide shade for streams  keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation b except as required by pa the riparian buffer easement shall be required for all streams as defined
