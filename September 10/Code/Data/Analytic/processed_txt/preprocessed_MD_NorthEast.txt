designation shall contain a buffer that was significantly impacted by development at the time of program adoption and that prevents the buffer from fulfilling its functions c developed parcels or lots shall contain a buffer intrusion by the principal structures excluding utilities or septic systems d undeveloped or vacant parcels or lots ie infill may be designated as a sba if development within the buffer can not be avoided based on the size of the parcel or lot area of the parcel or lot within the buffer or the surrounding pattern of development e if only part of a parcel or lot meets the criteria for designation as a sba then only those portions of a parcel or lot shall be designated as a sba the portion of the parcel designated as a sba will be subject to the sba development

be maintained even when they are mutually exclusive b identification the town has identified and mapped forests and developed woodlands within the critical area and has identified and mapped habitat protection areas as described more detailed evaluation of forest resources on specific sites shall be accomplished as part of the environmental analysis required prior to site plan and subdivision approval c policies for the protection of riparian and forest habitat the town adopts the following policies for the protection of riparian habitat 1 vegetation shall be maintained in its natural condition along all streams to provide wildlife corridors 2 a minimum 110foot buffer shall extend landward from the mean high water line of tidal water and the edge of tributary streams and tidal wetlands this area is to be conserved for wildlife protection 3 nontidal wetland forests should be left in a natural state for wildlife and water quality protection 4 forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling birds and other wildlife species for example relatively mature forested areas within the critical area of 100 acres or more or forest connected with these areas shall be conserved 5 existing riparian forests for example those relatively mature forest of at least 300 feet in width which occur adjacent to streams wetlands or the bay shoreline andor which are documented breeding areas shall be conserved d process if a forest is to be developed or to be harvested a sitespecific field investigation shall be conducted to determine if important sensitive species present and to make sure that appropriate protection measures are incorporated into the development plan or timber harvest plan when proposing development activities within riparian forests or forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling birds applicants are advised to review and utilize the guidance found in the critical area commission publication entitled a guide to the conservation of forest interior dwelling birds in the chesapeake bay critical area dated june 200 and as may be subsequently amended in addition the department of natural resources may make specific recommendations based on an evaluation of the site and the proposed development in general the following measures are recommended 1 minimize forest and woodlands disturbance from offroad vehicles public use or logging from may of each year  2 focus all development on the periphery of the forest or woodlands  3 retain the forest canopy as well as shrub understory  4 retain snag and mature seed trees as dens for woodpeckers and as nests for bald eagles  5 discourage the creation of small clearings and expansion of forest edge habitats  6 encourage reestablishment of native forests and woodlands  and 7 adopt harvest techniques to maintain or improve habitat e policies for the establishment or replacement of forest the following policies should be used for afforestation and reforestation 1 the replacement or establishment of forest or developed woodlands should ensure a diversified plant community and should include canopy trees understory trees shrubs and herbaceous plants 2 native species should be used for all reforestation and afforestation f buffer protection standards for timber for personal use individual trees may be cut for personal use if the trees cut

20 acres must remain outside of the development envelope or the acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted if the original parcel in the rca is less than 20 acres then the acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted if there is a permanently protected resource conservation area an area protected by easement adjacent and contiguous to a residue that is less than 20 acres that will result in a minimum 20 acre residue then the entire parcel does not have to be deducted d the minimum 20 acre residue outside of the development envelope may be developed at an rca density unless some type of permanent protection exists that restricts development 3 for growth allocation areas proposed in the rca a 300foot naturally vegetated buffer is strongly encouraged and where it is provided it shall

to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare structures that are inadequately elevated improperly floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses the town of north east by resolution agreed to meet the requirements of the national flood insurance program and was accepted for participation in the program on  as of that date or as of  the initial effective date of the town of north easts flood insurance rate map all development and new construction as defined herein are to be compliant with these regulations 12 statutory authorization the maryland general assembly in md land use title 4 has established as policy of the state that the orderly development and use of land

sewage disposal systems  d maintain natural drainage  e reduce financial burdens imposed on the community its governmental units and its residents by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding  f minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  g minimize prolonged business interruptions  h minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges  i reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions  j minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near floodprone areas  k provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of floodplains are maintained  l minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains  m prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible  and n meet community participation requirements of the national flood insurance program as set forth in the federal regulations cfr at 44 cfr 4 areas to which these regulations apply these regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the town of north east and identified in 5 basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and bfes a for the purposes of these regulations the minimum basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is the flood insurance study for cecil county maryland and incorporated areas dated  and  or the most recent revision thereof and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the firms the fis and firms are retained on file and available to the public at the north east town hall b where field surveyed topography or digital topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard on the firm the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area c to establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard areas that do not have such elevations shown on the firm the floodplain administrator may provide the best available data for base flood elevations may require the applicant to obtain available information from federal state or other sources or may require the applicant to establish special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations as set forth in of these regulations 16 abrogation and greater restrictions these regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing regulations and ordinances including subdivision regulations zoning ordinances

applied to the improvement of land by other than lot by lot development in a manner that would distort the objectives of this ordinance  to encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings  so that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation may extend to all citizens and residents of this town  and in order to encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that economies secured may ensure to the benefit of those who need homes  and in aid of these purposes to provide a procedure which can relate the type design and layout of residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within existing residential areas and to ensure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development authorized herein is carried out under such administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay 2 administration the administration of the procedures for application for and approval

to provide for and promote orderly growth of the same the highway corridor overlay district regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for the harmony and compatibility of development along the major highway corridors that serve as gateways to the community when other provisions of this more restrictive they shall apply all development within this district shall be subject to the procedures standards and guidelines specified in the following sections in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base zoning district in which the development occurs in cases of conflict the more restrictive standards andor requirements shall apply in particular the purpose of the highway corridor overlay district is as follows 1 to encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the towns major existing and proposed highways 2 to provide for the continued safe and efficient use of these roadways 3 to maintain natural beauty and scenic cultural and positive visual character of the corridor particularly distinctive views vistas and visual continuity 4 minimize intersection and site access points b these purposes will be accomplished of proposed developments within this overlay zoning district by the planning commission which shall review the location character and appearance of new development in a positive manner it is the purpose of such review to determine in a cooperative fashion with the applicant whether a proposed plan meets the guidelines and other standards of this zoning district c the highway corridor overlay zoning district shall include all lands within 500 feet of each side of the center line of the following rightsofway us 40 i95 and md 272 north of north east creek in addition

reviewed and approved subject to a master site plan the preliminary and final site plans shall indicate the phasing concept for overall development each phase shall require separate review and approval by the planning commission for consistency with the master site plan as well as satisfactory progress or completion of prior phases amended per ordinance 20100201 b applications for development plan approval on properties already developed for example an application for a construction authorization for an addition to an existing building shall be required to comply with the provisions of this to the extent possible as determined by the planning commission for the purposes of this the term to the extent possible shall not preclude the planning commission from requiring existing pavement be removed to enable establishment of visual enhancement buffer yards that entrancesexits and site traffic circulation be modified to improve channelization of traffic and reduction andor consolidation of entrancesexits on major highways or removal andor replacement of existing signs and associated lighting c development activity permitted within the district 1 any alteration of existing conditions of the land uses or structures within the highway corridor overlay district requiring a construction authorization from the town from the date of enactment of this section shall henceforth be done as provided for by this section or by other sections of this 2 the overlay district regulations are supplementary to the permitted uses and requirements for the appropriate underlying zoning district as contained in d development activity prohibited within the district uses prohibited in the underlying zoning district are also prohibited in the overlay district 3 tree protection the following regulations supplement but do not supersede the forest conservation by the town of north east on  and as amended a development of land for different uses and intensity of uses will often times necessitate the removal of trees to accommodate roads parking buildings and facilities it is the expressed intent of this every effort be made design layout and construction of development projects to incorporate and save as many trees as possible b no person shall cut destroy move or remove any living diseasefree tree of any species having a trunk with a diameter of eight 8 inches or larger in conjunction with any development of land governed by this until such removal or destruction has been approved under the provisions of this diameter is measured 45 feet above the ground and is referred to as diameter at breast height dbh c no person shall cut or clear land of trees for the sole purpose of offering land for sale d the clearcutting of trees is prohibited the term clearcutting as used herein shall mean the cutting of more than 75 percent of the trees six inches in trunk diameter or larger clearcutting pursuant to an approved development plan shall require

amended per ordinance 20100201 4 retention of andor creation of a minimum visual buffer along highway corridor rightofways a each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the rightofway line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas the purpose of the minimum visual buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots from the road to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site and to lessen spillover light from onsite lighting the buffer shall be continuous except as set forth in b below and be no less than the requirements for bufferyard b contained in appendix a the planning commission may require additional depth or density of planting at its discretion pursuant to findings that such increases are in the public interest and support the purposes of this section the depth of the bufferyard shall be measured from the existing rightofway line or from the new rightofway line should the application under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of or easement for proposed roadway purposes the minimum bufferyard depth shall not occur at the high activity areas of a project these areas include but are not limited to building entrances dropoffs and drivethrus amended per ordinance 20100201 to determine the average depth of the minimum visual buffer measurements shall be taken at intervals not greater than ten 10 feet parallel to the property or rightofway line side buffer areas required by other sections of this deep narrow land areas shall not be used when calculating the minimum visual buffer where lagoons and drainage swales occur in the minimum visual buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns additional buffer depth and vegetation shall be required to augment the screening effect detailed graphics exemplary photographs or renderings may be required by the planning commission to clarify and improve its understanding of the buffer issues involved amended per ordinance 20100201 b the intent of the minimum visual buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect this buffer may be enhanced or created where such vegetation is insufficient or nonexistent with trees and shrubs of a variety of species appropriate to town character if the minimum visual buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted herein their preservation is required where masses of native shrubs are present their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged while complete screening of a project is not required sufficient plant material shall be installed to accomplish the softening effect required in a above in order to maintain the screening effect existing vegetation shall not be limbedup from the ground more than five 5 feet to the lowest branches however if understory planting is planned existing vegetation may with the approval of the zoning administrator be limbedup to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plants minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with provisions of the tree protection requirements in above minimum height of new shrubs used to create the minimum visual buffer shall be three feet these plantings shall be shown on a master landscape plan meeting the requirements of  exemptions from buffer requirements exemptions whether partial or total from the bufferyard provisions of this section may be granted by the planning commission if it can be sufficiently demonstrated that such bufferyard will have a deleterious visual effect upon an existing situation or that preservation of existing trees or other unique natural vegetative resource particular effort on the part of a developer in protecting the existing natural environment warrants the relaxation of bufferyard requirements of this section the following outlines those anticipated situations where the bufferyard requirement may be relaxed or removed a protection of existing visual environment in the following cases where the characteristics of the existing visual environment would be detracted from by the provision of a required bufferyard 1 views and vistas of existing buildings which exhibit a high degree of aesthetic value serving to heighten the visual experience serve as important points of spatial identification contain value as important historical resources 2 views and vistas of existing natural landscapetopographical features of a particular locale which correspond to certain high points affording panoramic views views to settlement clusters views of water valleys and other elements of the physical landscape 3 views and vistas to existing recreationalopen space areas whether natural or manmade which serve to contribute to the overall visual environment uses such as golfcourses local parks cemeteries 4 views and vistas to which give the observer an awareness of a locations inherent character related to views of farmland pastures water activities such as docks or other maritime activities specific to the area b protection of proposed visual environment in the following cases where a proposed development intended to further enhance or protect the existing visual environment would be visually affected by the required bufferyard 1 a proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates innovation of design represents a focal point andor establishes a particular identifying element for the locale amended per ordinance 20100201 2 a proposed development which exhibits innovative site landscaping or which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above amended per ordinance 20100201 c retention of existing natural attributes of the site in this case significant steps must be taken by a developer to preserve significant tree stands topographic characteristics even in the event that such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible the intent is to provide incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its destruction and then to remedy the situation with new plantings d management of existing and proposed resources in order to encourage management programs for visual natural resources so that the continuation of such resource is assured bufferyard requirements may be reduced or waived 6 permitted activity in minimum visual buffer a no existing vegetation of any type size or origin shall be altered or removed unless it satisfies the tree protection requirements of b within the minimum visual buffer there shall be no development clearing grading or construction activity except for the following 1 roadway andor driveway access to the portion of the site not in the minimum visual buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to rightofway 2 provision for water sanitary sewer storm drainage electrical telephone natural gas cable etc service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the rightofway in the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road rightofway an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation removal permission for easement and rightofway disturbance and clearing for such services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes 3 pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road corridor provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer 4 lighting fixtures only for approved signs or if for safety reasons they cannot be placed outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and necessary easements can be established and constructed without reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer 5 signs shall be in accordance with the sign regulations in a reasonable effort should be made to locate all signage outside of the buffer 6 clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exits to any development as needed to provide for reasonable traffic safety in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices 7 architectural review a guidelines the compatible relationship of architecture along highway corridors is of public concern the intent of the architectural review is not to stifle innovative architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience from the roadway to accomplish this the planning commission shall use the following guidelines in reviewing proposed structures site improvements signs and streetscape improvements 1 proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms 2 proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner with the terrain and vegetation of the parcel and surrounding parcels structures shall impede as little as reasonably practical scenic views from the main road or from existing structures and

architectural design of structures and their materials and colors shall be visually harmonious with the overall appearance history and cultural heritage of the town with natural land forms and existing vegetation and with other development plans approved by the town specific consideration shall be given to compatibility with adjacent properties where such projects demonstrate the towns character a large work area doors or open bays shall not open toward or face the highway b heating ventilating and air conditioning equipment duct work air compressors other fixed operating machinery

unit multiplier is a factor by which the basic number of plant materials recommended for a given buffer yard is determined given a change in the width of that yard the type and quantity of plant materials recommended by each buffer yard and each buffer yard option including berms are specified in this section afforestation or reforestation plantings required under the cecil county forest conservation regulations may occur in buffer yards provided that such plantings meet the minimum requirements of the forest conservation regulations the options within any buffer yard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness in eliminating the impact of adjoining uses cost equivalence between options was attempted where possible generally the plant materials which are identified as desirable are determined by the types of soil present on the site each illustration depicts the total buffer yard located between two uses a2 plant material the following plant material
