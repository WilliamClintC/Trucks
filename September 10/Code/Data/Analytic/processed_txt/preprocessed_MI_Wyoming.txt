regulations of such uses in order to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city this article is enacted based upon the finding by the city that there are some uses which because of their very nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics the city also finds that the regulation of such uses is necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding residential neighborhoods nonresidential areas or other places of public congregation the provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor intent of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including adult or sexuallyoriented materials nor to restrict or deny access by adults to such materials

in other cities  the findings reported in the final report of the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 and statistics obtained from various health departments the council specifically finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments  there must be in place a mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located 3 sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live shows 4 offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses 7 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact 8 according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 9 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 10 nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution increases sexual assaults and attracts other criminal activity including drug use and sales 11 these findings raise substantial governmental concerns and indicate that it is necessary for protection of the public health safety and welfare to promulgate regulations for adult businesses 12 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 13 it is necessary and in the interest of the public health safety and welfare to promulgate zoning regulations for sexually oriented businesses  52101 definitions the following words terms and phrases when

the payment of nondiscriminatory permit fees which do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of granting permits and maintaining the rightsofway used by telecommunications providers and 4 assisting telecommunications providers in understanding the citys requirements for use of the public rightsofway and providing a fair and nondiscriminatory policy for permitting the use of the public

under this article and the access to and use of the public rightsofway by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights 1 right to require franchise  of the 1963 michigan constitution and the city charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city the applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under section 102dd of the michigan telecommunications act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services due to this and other legal and regulatory issues and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway and to otherwise comply with the terms of this article such a permit shall not constitute a franchise the city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city 2 rights regarding takings claim certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rightsofway and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property municipalities dispute that claim the city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would among other things constitute an unlawful taking by the united states in violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided the city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rightsofway at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee therefore notwithstanding any other provision hereof a permittee is not precluded by this article from seeking relief from the fee provisions of section 77111 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction if a permittee seeks such relief the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof neither this article nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee 3 option to obtain consent agreement the city finds that legislative legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community this would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers the issues affect among other things both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rightsofway in order to promote certainty encourage competition and avoid litigation the city will at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider it is the citys intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this article and would include among other things a fee of up to five percent of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider which would include the permit fee  an extended term of up to 15 years  authorization to conduct a local business in the city pursuant to of the 1963 michigan constitution  and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes notwithstanding the resolution of these legislative regulatory and legal requirements in the future a permittee may request a consent agreement at any time  11402 city signal

uniform form of franchise agreement established by the mpsc this form includes the right to use the public rightofway to provide such service but does not contain rightofway management and related provisions b municipalitys cable television consent agreement with its current cable operator predates the uniform video services local franchise act and has rightofway management and related provisions however that act states that as of  any provisions of such an agreement that are inconsistent with or in addition to the standardized uniform form of franchise agreement established by the mpsc are unreasonable and unenforceable by the franchising entity c telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized uniform form of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from municipality a permit under the metro act to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway such metro act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such rightofway usage standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the mpsc and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the mpsc d because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities such metro act permits generally provide adequate public rightofway related protections for municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services e other video service providers in particular new providers or existing cable operators may not have a metro act permit issued by municipality f the uniform video services local franchise act and the standardized uniform franchise agreement require video service
