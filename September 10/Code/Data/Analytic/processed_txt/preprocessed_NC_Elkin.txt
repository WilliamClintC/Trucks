rapidly changing and that the telecommunications act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and among these formally discrete industries at this time it is premature to know fully the extent to which there will be changes in law technology or services that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or licenses to use the towns rightsofway it is the desire of the town to be a communicationsfriendly town that encourages the development of competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens for this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the town should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete but rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all similarly situated

intended to promote a high level of future development and redevelopment that will a contribute to downtown elkin b stimulate investment in and strengthen the economic vitality of downtown elkin  and c build upon the positive physical image and identity of downtown elkin this overlay acknowledges the prevailing architectural character and development patterns within downtown the overlay does seek to assist in promoting and building upon the positive design features and architectural character that exists in downtown today additionally it is not the intent of this overlay to eliminate freedom or discourage innovative design the purpose of this overlay is to complement the town of elkins existing zoning ordinance and development guidelines for downtown this overlay is less quantitative than the mandatory development standards found within the zoning the town of elkin or elkins subdivision standards and this allows some inherent flexibility in application to specific projects 2 organization the overlay district is organized into the following sections a introduction provides an overview of the purpose organization applicability and other aspects of the overlay b context and compatibility establishes basic rule of thumb for integrating new development into the existing urban fabric of downtown elkin and emphasizes the proper treatment of the edge condition of existing and proposed development c downtown guidelines provides standards of design and development within an historic architectural context for use in the overlay this section is divided into two categories 1 infill and 2 storefront design d signs set forth general and specific guidelines which tend to enhance the image of downtown and improve the effectiveness of signs for businesses e landscaping provides a basic landscape design framework which is to be used in conjunction with new development and as a helpful tool for property owners interested in upgrading the landscaping of existing development f secretary of the interior guidelines for the rehabilitation of older buildings that are eligible for historic tax credits 3 understanding the terminology to aid in the understanding of this overlay district a development applicant should differentiate the meaning of should encouraged and discouraged overlay district guidelines which employ the word should are intended to be applied as stated an alternative measure may be considered if it meets or exceeds the intent of the guideline guidelines using the words encouraged or discouraged are not mandatory but express a more or less desirable design solution 4 applicability the provisions of this section are applicable to all development within the b1 central business district 87 any new building additions exterior alterations or landscaping and any modification to an approved landscaping plan or parking lot design should adhere to the downtown design overlay district as applicable it is important to note however that these guidelines do not affect existing buildings that are not proposed for new construction exterior alterations landscaping or changes in the parking lot layout the overlay district requirements will be utilized during the towns development approval process and should be provided to applicants during preapplication conferences to encourage the highest level of design quality and concurrently provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity on the part of project designers in response to existing site conditions 5 exemptions when in compliance with all other town ordinances the following projects are exempted from all provisions of the downtown design overlay district a construction underground which will not leave any significant permanent marks on the surface after completion utility boxes pipes and poles shall be considered significant permanent marks  b maintenance work on buildings landscaping or grounds including parking lots which does not significantly alter the appearance or function of the building landscaping or grounds  c interior remodeling work  d landscape maintenance and upkeep including relatively minor replacement of plants other than trees  e temporary uses and structures as defined by the elkin zoning   f routine roof maintenance and repair overall roof reconstruction is subject to this overlay b  context & compatibility existing buildings streetscape and landscaping establish the frame of reference for new development this is particularly true throughout downtown elkin where an historic urban fabric is well represented by commercial structures generally to create harmony between the existing urban fabric and new elements introduced into the downtown all new structures additions and uses should be compatible with the prevailing historic architectural character of the surrounding area site amenities such as large mature trees should be preserved and should become part of any new project or addition and structures and activities should be located and designed to avoid creating nuisances and hazards for adjoining properties particularly residential properties the concept of compatible design is one of the most important concepts to be aware of when using these design guidelines compatible designs do not seek to imitate the historic architecture found in downtown but do reflect their surroundings in terms of design concepts  mass scale rhythm color materials and building arrangement compatible designs will be in harmony with the best designs of surrounding developments rules of thumb pertaining to context and compatibility include 1 all new construction and development should incorporate those characteristics of the downtown that exhibit a positive distinctive architectural style andor established functional or landscape patterns 2 new buildings and additions should be sited in a manner that will complement rather than conflict with existing adjacent buildings landscape streetscape parking and access 3 transitions between existing and new buildings or additions should be gradual the height and mass of new projects or construction should not create abrupt changes from those of existing buildings 4 natural amenities such as mature trees and views should be preserved and incorporated in the design of downtown projects where applicable buildings shall front the street and should not turn their backs to existing or potential amenities 5 buildings should be oriented to connect with high activity areas such as restaurant dining areas or major pedestrian areas in order to create connections and linkages 88 6 noise or odor generating activities in general and loading areas trash and storage areas and rooftop equipment in particular should be located as far as possible from adjacent residences and shall never be located next to residential properties without fully mitigating their negative effects they should also be screened from view of either bridge street market street or main street 7 commercial and other nonresidential buildings and associated activity areas should be oriented to avoid significant shading of adjacent residences and compromising residents privacy 8 where downtown buildings are adjacent to residential neighborhoods downtown buildings should maintain low profiles and heights should be stepped down to the height of adjacent residential zones utilizing architectural elements such as gables or hip roofs to reduce building mass 9 windows in commercial and other nonresidential buildings should be oriented to preclude a direct line of sight into adjacent residential buildings or property c  downtown guidelines the construction of new buildings and rehabilitation of existing buildings within the central business district b1 in downtown elkin is important for continued economic growth and diversity in the town it is extremely important that new buildings erected in the downtown are compatible with existing buildings which generally reflect the architectural styles of the early to midtwentieth century it is the desire of the town to have buildings in the central business district represent architectural styles of this era rather than some contemporary franchise architectural dictate from some other place 1 infill since these buildings will be constructed on vacant or underutilized lots thus filling a hole in the street frontage they are called infill construction the design of an infill building particularly its front facade should be influenced by the other facades on the street but should not attempt to create an exact replica the infill structure should be sympathetic and compatible with surrounding buildings in terms of mass scale height faade rhythm placement of doors and windows storefront design color and use of materials since good infill design responds directly to its surroundings it is not possible to develop specific guidelines which apply in every case there are however several general design principles which should govern the visual ties between a new infill building and its neighboring historic structures found in downtown elkin a faade proportion 1 the characteristic proportion relationship of height to width of existing facades should be respected in relation to new infill development 89 2 whenever an infill building is proposed that is much wider than the existing characteristic facades on the street the infill facades should be broken down into a series of appropriately proportioned structural bays storefronts or components typically segmented by a series of columns or masonry piers which frame window door and bulkhead components 3 an infill building should not be much higher than the height of surrounding historic structures in downtown in no case shall any new buildings exceed fifty 50 feet in height b proportion of openings 1 maintain the predominant difference between upper story openings and street level storefront openings windows and doors usually there is a much greater window area at the storefront level for pedestrians to have a better view of the merchandise displayed behind as opposed to upper stories that have smaller window openings 2 whenever an infill building is proposed which has two adjacent commercial structures attempt to maintain the characteristic rhythm proportion and spacing of existing door and window openings 2 whenever an infill building is proposed which has two adjacent commercial structures attempt to maintain the characteristic rhythm proportion and spacing of existing door and window openings 90 c horizontal rhythms 1 whenever an infill building is proposed identify the common horizontal elements eg cornice line window heightwidth and spacing found among local historic structures and develop the infill design utilizing a similar rhythm or alignment 2 if maintaining a horizontal rhythm or alignment in an infill building is very difficult or otherwise impossible the use of fabric canopies or awnings is strongly encouraged to establish a shared horizontal storefront rhythm d wall articulation 1 long blank unarticulated street wall facades without window or door openings are strongly discouraged and should be divided into a series of structural bays eg characterized by masonry piers which frame window and door elements 2 monolithic street wall facades should be broken by vertical and horizontal articulation eg sculpted carved or penetrated wall surface defined by recesses and reveals characterized by a breaks reveals recesses  in the surface of the wall itself  b placement of window and door openings  or c the placement of balconies awnings and canopies 3 avoid large unbroken faade surfaces at the storefront level this can be achieved in a number of ways including  a dividing the faade into a series of display windows with smaller panes of glass  b constructing the faade with small human scale materials such as brick or decorative tile along bulkheads  c providing traditional recessed entries  d careful sizing placement and overall design of signage  and e providing consistent door and window reveals e roofs 1 roofs may be flat or sloped consistent with surrounding buildings older twentieth century commercial vernacular buildings used flat roofs with decorative parapets and heavy cornice lines 2 cornice lines of new buildings horizontal rhythm element should be aligned with buildings on adjacent properties to avoid divergent clashes in building height 3 radical roof pitches which create overly prominent or outofcharacter buildings such as aframes massive mansards geodesic domes quonset hut roofs or chalet style buildings are strongly discouraged 4 the use of decorative parapets is encouraged if they have substantial visual interest which incorporates vertical articulation f building material palette building materials to be used on infill buildings are to be consistent with the materials used on adjacent buildings the following tables present recommended and discouraged building materials for infill construction 91 recommended materials for infill structures not including existing buildings building walls  clear glass glass block storefront only  glass block transom  new or used facebrick  cut stone rusticated block cast stone  ceramic tiles bulkhead  stucco  horizontal clapboard lap wood siding  not allowed in the fire district roofs where visible  standing seam metal roof or other metal roofing  class a composition shingles limited to refurbishment of residential structures  tile of neutral color  rolled rubber

pecky cedar  used brick with no fired face salvaged from interior walls  vertical wood siding board & batten  coarsely finished roughsaw on rustic materials eg wood shakes barnwood board and batten or t111 siding  plastic panelsvinyl siding  steel or metal siding discouraged roofs where visible  crushed stone  shake  brightly colored tile orange blue etc  corrugated fiberglass  asphalt sheeting 93 g mechanical equipment screening it is strongly encouraged that any mechanical or utility equipment whether on the roof beside of the building or on the ground be screened the method of screening shall be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials color shape and size where freestanding mechanical equipment is provided a continuous solid screen is desirable onroof mechanical equipment should be screened by solid building elements eg parapet wall or roof well instead of afterthefact addonscreening eg wood or metal slats h setbacks and build to lines  the first floor of any new infill building shall be built at the front property line if a building proposes to have a plaza area located between its front and the front property line this may be allowed on a casebycase basis in no event will surface parking be allowed between the building and front property line  canopies trellises and other accessory structures which are relatively open and do not restrict pedestrian or vehicular movement may project over the rightofway with a town or ncdot encroachment approval i street orientation  it is strongly encouraged that the front building faade be oriented parallel to the street  storefronts should be designed to orient to the major street frontage while side or rear entries may be desirable the predominant major building entry shall be oriented toward the major street j parking lot orientation  parking lots shall be located to the rear or sides of buildings  locating parking lots between the front property line and the building storefront is prohibited anywhere in the overlay  rear parking lots shall be designed and located contiguous to each other so that vehicles can travel from one private parking lot to the other reciprocal access without having to enter the street  private parking lots with side street frontage should be attractively landscaped with trees and shrubs in order to continue the linear street frontage created by the existing flanking buildings and to screen parked vehicles low masonry garden walls or landscaping 3 feet maximum height at the setback line are also encouraged to screen parking from the side street  common reciprocal access driveways which provide vehicular access to adjacent parcels are required shared parking and circulation aisles coordinated between adjacent businesses and or developments are also encouraged  whenever possible locate parking lot entries on side streets in order to minimize pedestrianvehicular conflicts along the primary street frontage main street 2 storefront design 94 building facades including the storefront are the most important visual elements of commercial structures facades also experience significant change during a buildings life and hold the most potential for creative alterations affecting both the characters of the building and the streetscape in an effort to promote quality design for new infill building and the rehabilitation of existing buildings the following specific storefront and faade guidelines are presented a entriesdoorways commercial storefront entries are typically recessed andor sheltered by a covered arcade structure canopy or awning this provides more area for display space a sheltered transition area to the interior of the store and emphasizes the entrance recessed entries should be retained and are strongly encouraged b faade color  the use of light subdued or neutral earth tone colors and natural building materials such as brick or stone are encouraged  adjacent buildings should be painted different but complementary colors no strikingly contrasting colors  one base color should be used for the entire faade different trim colors are encouraged but should not exceed three different colors  different window frame and sash colors are encouraged but should complement the main color of the building  primary colors are prohibited on faade exteriors  stripes polka dots checkerboard patterns and other distracting paint combinations are prohibited c awnings and canopies  awnings are encouraged and should have a single color or twocolor stripes lettering and trim utilizing other colors is allowed but will be considered as sign area  awning shape should relate to the window or door opening barrel shaped awnings should be use to complement arched windows window replacement 95  all awnings should be well maintained washed regularly and replaced when faded or torn  when there are several businesses in one building awnings of the same color should be used with simple signs on the valance flap that may vary in type and style and color to differentiate the individual businesses within the building d door and window design  accentuate the door with simple details such as a handsome brass door pull brass kick plate or an attractive painted sign  doors to retail shops should contain a high percentage of glass in order to view the retail contents  when considering new window fenestration window size size of windowpanes mullion type window materials it is important that the new design be sympathetic and compatible with the faade theme of the whole block streetscape  use of clear glass 88% light transmission on the first floor is highly recommended  storefront windows should be as large as possible and no closer that 18 from the ground bulkhead height by limiting the bulkhead heights the visibility to the storefront displays and retail interior is maximized maximum bulkhead heights for new construction shall be 36  discourage introducing or changing the location or size of windows or other openings that alter the architectural rhythm alignment or character of the original building e rear entry design  design the rear entry to fit the casual visual character of the alley or rear entrance and provide a pleasant protected space  the rear entry door should be wood and glass similar to the front door special security glass is permitted  security lighting should be modest and should focus on the rear entry door  selective use of tree plantings potted plants and other landscaping can subtly original windows and tile bulkhead not acceptable aluminum frame wframed bulkhead not acceptable blockedup with stone veneer original not acceptable aluminum casement not acceptable blockedup 96 improve a rear faade  refuse containers and service facilities should be screened from view by solid masonry walls with metal doors or metal fence use landscaping shrubs and vines to screen walls and help deter graffiti window replacement  if a window has deteriorated beyond repair or is missing the replacement should match the original window in terms of design and materials replacement windows should fill the existing opening and duplicate the original window pattern for example a doublehung sash window should not be replaced by a single fixed pane of glass  avoid the use of windows and shutters that are not in keeping with the original style of the building g door replacement every effort should be made to maintain andor repair an original door if possible h removal of existing canopies and metal awnings metal aluminum canopies have a thin unsubstantial and tacked on appearance which is inconsistent with the desirable design concept for downtown elkin existing metal canopies should be removed and if appropriate replaced with fabric awnings consistent with the architectural style of the building i removal of elements inconsistent with original faade building owners contemplating renovation will be encouraged to remove building elements incompatible with the original faade design these include overdone exterior embellishments and modernized elements such as board and batten or themed materials j preserve traditional decoration many times in the remodeling of storefronts original decorative details are intact as visual leftovers or simply covered up with new construction if the building is to be refurbished these forgotten details should not be wasted if enough of them remain they can be restored as part of the original design if only a few remain they can be incorporated as design features in a new storefront in either case the design of any improvements should grow out of the remaining traditional details and create a harmonious background that emphasizes them k selection of building materials some contemporary materials are often used to apply shopping mall style facades over the rich character of traditional downtown buildings materials such as cedar shakes textured plywood stone veneer stucco veneer and plastic are not appropriate for use on traditional facades in downtown elkin 97 dsigns signs in downtown elkin should advertise a place of business or provide directions and information an effective sign and graphics system functions not as a separate entity but as an integral part of the built environment carefully planned signs communicate essential information while also ordering and enhancing the architectural character of downtown a signs use of color size shape placement and selection of lettering can attract or detract from its effectiveness an effectively designed sign should  be compatible with the surrounding physical and visual character of the area   promote the individuality of establishments   identify the business clearly and attractively   enhance the building on which it is located  and  reduce the amount of visual clutter caused by excessive and poorly placed signage the towns sign regulations to control the size location and number of signs but code restrictions alone may not be enough design criteria are needed to encourage and coordinate welldesigned signs the following sign guidelines are intended to assure the local merchant that all other downtown commercial establishments are similarly regulated 1 preferred sign types while many sign types are permitted in downtown the following sign types are preferred  under canopy signs  business wallmounted id signs in sign board area at upper portion of first story   awning signs   projecting signs   murals and supergrahics not advertising a business painted on a wall surface   permanent painted window signs first floor limited to 25% of the window area   building signs containing the name of the business at rear entrances used by customers  and  signs made of carved or sandblasted wood or metal 2 general design guidelines 98 a clear sign message  use a brief message the fewer the words the more effective the sign a sign with brief succinct message is simpler and faster to read looks cleaner and is more attractive  avoid hardtoread overly intricate typefaces these typefaces are difficult to read and reduce the signs ability to communicate  lettering should be in proportion to the size of the sign as a rule of thumb the recommended size of letters is between onethird 13 to onehalf 12 the height of the sign  avoid signs with strange shapes signs that are unnecessarily narrow oddly shaped or unrelated to the product or services being provided on the site can restrict the legibility of the message if an unusual shape is not symbolic it is probably confusing  use widely recognized logos rather than printtest whenever possible  make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians the pedestrianoriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet  the vehicleoriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance the closer a signs viewing distance the smaller the sign needs to be b sign color  colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity of signage even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection  a substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night  limit colors to three on a single sign color is most effective when used simply too many colors particularly accent colors may distract the reader reduce legibility and make the sign less effective  vertical or horizontal wooden signs can be effectively utilized in a variety of ways on windows building surfaces or as accent bands a wooden wall sign can be painted or stained and sealed for a more natural look depending upon the appearance of the surrounding structures lettering can consist of metal or raised wood and when placed within a sign band will serve to unify the building faade carved or sandblasted wood signs are also appropriate  metal sign panels can utilize raised lettering on metal bands printing and lettering can also be applied directly to a flat metal sign band with letters consisting of wood acrylic or metal c sign architectural compatibility  signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and neighborhood in which they are located 99  sign size should be proportionate the size and shape of a sign should be proportionate with the scale of the structure  signs should be an appropriate scale with the building on which they are placed and should not overwhelm the architecture of the building and the character of the neighborhood  place wall signs to establish faade rhythm scale and proportion where faade rhythm doesnt exist in many buildings that have a monolithic or plain faade signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion  as an alternative to an attached sign lettering may be attached directly on the building faade 3 wall mounted signs  the identification of each building or stores address in sixinch high numbers over the main entry doorway or within ten feet of the main entry is recommended  sign lettering for storefront wall

102  trees should not obstruct the sight lines of motorists or pedestrians especially at pedestrian crosswalks  trees and shrubbery should not be located so that they interfere with the effectiveness of parking lot and street lighting  landscaping material so long as it is properly maintained is the preferred method used to buffer the view of any parking or storage area adjacent from a public street or pedestrian area  landscape screen plant materials should be large enough at planting to provide effective screening and be capable of growing to the height and density desired within a
