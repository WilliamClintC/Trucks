of section  the following shall also apply a fire systems fire protection systems consist of sprinklers hose connections and hydrants sprinkler systems may be dry or wet open or closed systems of fixedspray nozzles may be used indoors or outdoors for protection of flammableliquid and other hazardous processes it is standard practice especially in cities to equip automatic sprinkler systems with fire department pumper connections a meter compound detector check should not normally be permitted as part of a backflow prevention assembly an exception may be made however if the meter and backflow prevention assembly are specifically designed for that purpose for crossconnection control fire protection systems shall be classified on the basis of water source and arrangement of supplies as follows 1 class 1 direct connections from public water mains only  no pumps tanks or reservoirs  no physical connection from other water supplies  no antifreeze or other additives or any kind  all sprinkler drains discharging to atmosphere dry wells or other safe outlets 2 class 2 same as class 1 except that booster pumps may be installed in the connections from the street mains booster pumps do not affect the potability of the system  it is necessary however to avoid drafting so much water that pressure in the water main is reduced below 20 psi 3 class 3 direct connection from public water supply main plus one or more of the following elevated storage tanks  fire pumps taking suction from aboveground covered reservoirs or tanks  and pressure tanks all storage facilities are filled or connected to public water only the water in the tanks to be maintained in a potable condition 4 class 4 directly supplied from public mains similar to classes 1 and 2 and with an auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises  or an auxiliary supply may be located within 1700 feet of the pumper connection class 4 systems will normally require backflow protection at the service connection the type air gap or reduced pressure will generally depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply 5 class 5 directly supplied from public mains and interconnected with auxiliary supplies such as pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to contamination or rivers and ponds  driven wells mills or other industrial water systems  or where antifreeze or other additives are used classes 4 and 5 systems normally would need maximum protections air gap or reduced pressure to protect the public potable water system 6 class 6 combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from the public water mains only with or without gravity storage or pump suction tanks class 6 system protection would depend on the requirements of both industry and fire protection and could only be determined by a survey of the premises b when a backflow prevention assembly is required for a water service connection supplying water only to a fire system the assembly shall be installed on the

habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  2006 variance procedure nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of willcox to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2006   appeal board a the floodplain board of the city of willcox shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance b the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance c in passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of
