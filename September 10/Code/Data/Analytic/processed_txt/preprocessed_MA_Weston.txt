reduce flooding stream bank erosion siltation nonpoint source pollution property damage and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats 4 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  establish minimum design criteria for the protection of properties and aquatic resources downstream from land development and land conversion activities from damages due to alterations in volume velocity frequency duration and peak flow rate of storm water runoff  establish minimum design criteria for measures to eliminate or minimize to the extent feasible nonpoint source pollution from stormwater runoff which would otherwise degrade water quality 5 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet or exceed the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards 6 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management better site design practices or lowimpact development practices such as reducing impervious cover increasing sitewide infiltration and preserving open space and other natural areas to the maximum extent practicable 7 promote water conservation reuse of stormwater for irrigation 8 establish provisions that require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation and control the volume and rate of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance activities  9 establish provisions to ensure that soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and stormwater runoff control practices are incorporated into the site planning and design process and are implemented and maintained 10 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety or the environment 11 establish provisions to ensure there is an adequate funding mechanism including surety for the proper review inspection and

streamswetlands  1 model boh regulation for private wells guidance in using the model regulation  dear board of health  the massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep developed the following model boh regulation for private wells for the use by boards of health boh in adopting a municipal regulation governing private wells within their borders this model regulation as written serves to regulate private wells used for drinking water and irrigation purposes this model regulation does not address the installation of geothermal wells the requirements for siting construction and water quality sampling necessary to obtain masssdep approval of underground injection control uic registration for these types of wells are specified in the massdep guidelines for ground source heat pump wells this document serves as a model regulation  the contents can be modified by the boh so that unique situations or concerns of the municipality can be addressed by the regulation if the boh wants to include r technical requirements in addition to those contained in the model regulation you may find the documents found on the massdep drinking water program webpage useful in crafting your regulation for instance the private well guidelines contains more detailed technical guidance on private well construction than the model regulation these documents can be found at  it is highly recommended that the board develop standardized forms for information requested of private well owners by these regulations such forms may include the following well construction permit application pumping test report water quality report andor water supply certificate application examples of these forms are included in the appendix to this document some additional points to consider incorporating into the local regulation are well construction permit the board may choose to indicate that applicants for well construction permits are be required to obtain additional local permits eg plumbing andor building permits when for some reason a change is made in well drilling company after the initial drilling permit is issued the board may chose to require a new permit application and fee as reflected in the model regulation language however you can revise the regulation to allow the transfer of the drilling permit with an appropriate written notice from the new certified well driller  2 well siting the board may choose to require additional information pertaining to the location of hazardous waste sites underground storage tanks agricultural land uses permitted groundwater discharges andor utility rightsof way that are within 5001000 feet of the well site it is prohibited by 310 cmr2222 2 j to have a cross connection between a public water system and a private well used for either drinking water or irrigation purposes water quantity the massdep private well guidelines section entitled water quantity pumping tests provides a table of values listing gallons of water per foot of water column length for various casing or hole diameters and a table of flow volumes in gallons per minute and corresponding flow volumes in gallons per day water quality testing massdep recommends that board of health regulations require that potable wells meet massachusetts primary and secondary drinking water standards and guidelines these standards and guidelines for private wells are excerpted and noted in the most recent update of massdep recommended parameters and testing frequency for private wells massdep recommends that board of health regulations specify the parameters for which water is required to be tested rather than generally stating that the water must meet drinking water standards such general statements could provide a loophole whereby an applicant could test the well water for only one or two parameters and as long as the water met drinking water standards for those parameters the well would pass the water quality test massdep recommends that the board of health regulation do not include the mcl or the secondary mcl values for particular contaminants because these standards are subject to change unless the boh decides to adopt a standard more stringent than the current massdep standard for drinking water for the massdeps recommended list of water quality testing parameters for which a potable private well should be tested the board of health is referred to the massdep website  additional test requirements for volatile organic compounds vocs and synthetic organic compounds socs should be required in areas known to be or suspected as being impacted by other pollutants listed in the massdepors standards and guidelines for chemicals in massachusetts drinking waters to check for dep classified hazardous waste sites in your town you can use the searchable waste site listsite files database at  water quality sampling for geothermal wells is not required under this regulation parameters required for these types of wells are specified in the massdep ground source heat pump permitting requirements well construction massdep does not recommend boards of health allow dug wells as these types of wells are shallow making them especially susceptible to contamination and seasonally fluctuating water tables in communities where they are allowed they should be permitted only as a last resort you may choose to adopt more detailed construction requirements than contained in this model regulation the massdep private well guidelines contain additional information on well construction well screen   3 pump installation grouting and wellhead completion that can be incorporated into the locally adopted regulation decommissioning the massdep private well guidelines section entitled decommissioning abandoned wells test holes and dry or inadequate borings contains a more comprehensive discussion of plugging procedures and other aspects of decommissioning and contains specific recommendations for the contents of a well decommissioning report which the board may choose to require a well driller to submit if you have any questions about the model regulation or would like assistance in drafting your towns private

9 2 the storage capacity of the well shall be determined using the measured static water level and the depth and radius of the drillhole or casing 3 the required volume shall be calculated by adding the volumes of water in 1 and 2 above it is this volume of water that must be pumped from the well within a twentyfour 24 hour period the pumping test may be performed at whatever rate is desired following the pumping test the water level in the well must be shown to recover to within eightyfive 85 percent of the prepumped static water level within a twentyfour 24 hour period example 1 a one bedroom house with a well six 6 inches in diameter containing 200 feet  of standing water 1 1 bedroom + 1 bedroom   2 bedrooms x 110 gallons per bedroom x safety factor of 2   440 gallons needed daily 2 the volume of a 6inch well is 15 gallons for every foot of water column length therefore 200 feet  of standing water x 1 5 galfeet    300 gallons 3 440 gallons + 300 gallons   740 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24 hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity recovery to at least 85% of the static water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation of pumping example 2 for a 4 bedroom house with a well that is six 6 inches in diameter containing 100 feet  of standing water 1 4 bedroom house + 1 bedroom   5 bedrooms x 110 gallons per bedroom x safety factor of 2   1100 gallons needed daily 2 the volume of a 6inch well is 15 gallons for every foot of water volume length therefore 100 feet  of standing water x 1 5 galfeet    150 gallons 3 1100 gallons + 150 gallons 1250 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24 hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity recovery to at least 85% of the static water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation
