foreclosure general provisions  policy it is the general policy of the city of port townsend to emphasize code compliance by education and prevention as a first step this policy is designed to ensure code compliance and timely action that is available to all persons and is uniform in its implementation while warnings and voluntary compliance are desirable as a first step enforcement and civil penalties should be used consistent with the criteria set forth below for remedial purposes as needed to assure and effect code compliance abatement or remediation including restoration of a situation to preactivity condition is a primary goal in all cases and pursued when appropriate and feasible abatement or remediation occurs where an owner subsequently brings the activity into code compliance by obtaining required permits and completing work consistent with the permits however the owner is still subject to other judicial or administrative remedies including penalties there are situations where restoration of a situation to preactivity condition will not be feasible for example damage to or destruction of an older larger significant tree in such situations remediation based on reasonable replacement criteria would apply and the owner is still subject to other judicial or administrative remedies including penalties uniform and efficient procedures with consistent application tailored by regulation should be used to accomplish this policy without having attempted to secure voluntary compliance or where voluntary compliance occurs after a violation the director shall consider issuing a notice and order with civil penalties andor a civil infraction with civil penalties under the following circumstances awhen an emergency exists  or bwhen a repeat violation occurs whether or not the same or a similar violation and whether or not the violation occurred on the project or site in question or occurred on another project or site  or cwhen the director finds the

prohibited exemptions and special provisions variances enforcement penalty clerk to maintain copy of adopted statute and regulation public nuisance  declaration of policy athe city council of the city of port townsend finds that noise can unreasonably disturb and interfere with the peace and quiet of citizens and visitors and that it is appropriate and reasonable to balance the rights of citizens who are disturbed by excessive noise with the rights of citizens to free expression and to be free from unreasonable governmental regulation it is the policy of the city to minimize the exposure of citizens to excessive levels of noise and to promote and preserve the public health safety and general welfare the regulation of noise in this chapter is based on proscribing only conduct that unreasonably disturbs or interferes with the peace comfort and repose of others bthe intent of the city council is to regulate the level of noise in a manner that promotes commerce the use value and enjoyment of property sleep repose and the quality of the environment recognizing that expression associated with sounds must be protected so long as the manner of expression does not unreasonably interfere with the peace comfort and repose of others cin particular the citys historic commercial district is associated with uses and places where music is an important aspect of the district such music should reasonably be accommodated and the intent of this chapter is to place reasonable hour limitations on the playing of music so as to protect against excessive noise that disturbs sleep and that do not unduly burden the playing of music in the historic commercial district dwhile some cities have based noise regulation on decibelbased measures only the city council believes that public disturbance noise regulations provides an additional reasonable measure to address excessive noise as stated by the washington court of appeals in everett v obrien 31 wn app 319 641 p 2d 714 1982 upholding everetts ordinance proscribing noise which unreasonably disturbs or interferes with the peace comfort and repose of owners or possessors of real property requiring a police officer to promptly appear with a soundmetering device whenever a noise complaint is filed unreasonably restricts the citys ability to control the level of noise in the community also as stated by the court in everett v obrien a person of ordinary understanding is capable of determining when noise from his motorcycle is unreasonably disturbing the peace comfort and repose of others this standard is more helpful than decibel levels to the average citizen in determining whether or not conduct is unlawful to the same effect is the court of appeals statement in holland v city of tacoma 90 wn app 533 954 p 2d 290 1998 upholding against constitutional challenge tacomas ordinance which prohibited the playing of car sound systems at a volume that would be audible at a distance greater than 50 feet this ordinance has clear guidelines a person of ordinary intelligence knows what it means for sound to be audible at more than 50 feet ewith the exception of sound from motor vehicle sound systems audible at a distance greater than 50 feet the intent of this chapter is to require notice to the person making or responsible for allowing public disturbance noise or noise in violation of decibel levels warning that continued making of such noise is unlawful and violations of noise regulations in this chapter should occur only when a person intentionally refuses to cease the disturbing noise after having been requested to do so by a law enforcement officer   noise violation a noise violation can occur based either on creating noise in excess of the limits established by wac maximum

unreasonably disturb or interfere with the peace comfort and repose of one or more persons of average sensitivities a sound meter reading is not necessary to establish that a public disturbance noise exists bprohibition  general except as provided in this chapter see ptmc  exemptions and special provisions it is unlawful for any person to knowingly cause or make or for any person in possession of property including a motor vehicle knowingly to allow to originate from the property or vehicle sound that is a public disturbance noise cprohibition  specific except as provided in this chapter see ptmc  exemptions and special provisions creation of the following sounds so as to unreasonably disturb or interfere with the peace comfort and repose of one or more persons of average sensitivities are determined to be public disturbance noises the list is not exclusive of other sounds that constitute public disturbance noise or noises that are otherwise prohibited by law 1the frequent repetitive or continuous sounding of any horn siren or car alarm attached to a motor vehicle except as a warning of danger or as specifically permitted or required by law 2the creation of frequent repetitive or continuous sounds in connection with the starting operation repair rebuilding or testing of any motor vehicle motorcycle offhighway vehicle or internal combustion engine within or audible within a residential district established pursuant to the city of port townsend zoning code 3loud and frequent repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds made by the human voice or voices 4the creation of loud and frequent repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds including temporary projects for the maintenance of or repair of homes grounds and including but not limited to sounds from lawnmowers powered hand tools snow removal equipment and composters which emanate from any building structure or property within a residential district established pursuant to the city of port townsend zoning code 5the creation of loud and frequent repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds made by the use of a musical instrument sound amplifier or other device or combination of devices capable of producing or reproducing sound 6the creation of loud and frequent repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds from any sound system such as radios compact disc players or tape players

procedures seizure and impoundment as prescribed by law 9frequent or repetitive sounding of false car alarm dnoise from moving vehicle the playing using operating or permitting to be played or used or operated of any sound system from a moving motor vehicle such as radios compact disc players or tape players operated at a volume as to be audible at distances greater than 50 feet from the location of the vehicle is a public disturbance noise the 50foot requirement does not apply to a motor vehicle that is standing or stopped the intent of this section is that it is a violation of this chapter regulating noise if a sound system from a moving vehicle is audible at a distance of 50 feet as provided by ptmc b enforcement it is not required that a citizen complaint be made concerning the noise and from a moving vehicle the police officer is not required to give a written warning before a citation is issued the reason to allow the police to take prompt action concerning a moving vehicle is precisely because the vehicle is moving and prompt action is necessary to alleviate the situation by the time a citizen makes a complaint the vehicle has moved on somewhere else the last sentence of this section means that it is a violation of the noise ordinance for a nonmoving vehicle one that is standing or parked to make loud noise without reference to whether it is audible for a distance of 50 feet the operator of a vehicle that is stopped or standing can only receive a citation if a citizen first complains and the operator does not cease the noise after a written warning from a police officer a parked vehicle is like any other noise source there must first be a citizen complaint and a written warning before a citation issues also it wouldnt make sense to allow a vehicle to be parked outside a house or business at a distance less than 50 feet and generate loud noise that unreasonably offends the property owner in that situation the property owner could complain and the police could respond and give the car operator a warning   exemptions and special provisions athe following sounds are exempt from the provisions of this chapter at all times and all locations 1sounds

encourage tourism setting reasonable time place and manner restrictions on protected speech and expression helps protect this investment in infrastructure and preserve the use of sidewalks for reasonably unimpeded safe and efficient pedestrian traffic including for tourists while at the same time accommodating protected speech eover the last couple of years a number of citizens have complained that certain free speech use of the sidewalks in the downtown area is so extensive and intrusive that it interferes with access to pope marine park or has the effect of obstructing substantial portions of the sidewalk one person in particular displays large and intrusive whiteboards with various messages these displays run for at least 80 to 100 feet on the sidewalk and substantially interfere with free open and safe travel by pedestrians and others with disabilities and those using strollers or other accessories the complaints with one or two exceptions do not object to the content of these messages the complaints have been both written and verbal last fall out of concern that this type of use could create a safety issue if it occurred during the wooden boat festival and the arts and crafts fair the council adopted temporary regulations prohibiting placing any obstruction on the sidewalk free speech vending cart or otherwise in the event zone area in the immediate vicinity of the festivals fwithout reasonable limits such activities effectively and unreasonably take over substantial portions of sidewalks and substantially interfere with pedestrian

that users may know in advance of any activity that is allowed hthese rules provide the opportunity to anyone to obtain an administrative interpretation of these rules if a user is unclear of the standards and requirements and wishes to obtain an interpretation in advance of engaging in any conduct ithese rules also provide an opportunity to seek a variance from the application of the rules if

appropriate public services and facilities including transportation facilities are provided concurrently with development it is hereby found that the provisions of this title are necessary to implement the port townsend comprehensive plan bit is further found that the port townsend comprehensive plan sets forth the following policy direction and that the provisions of this title are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan 1 allow relatively narrow local access streets so as to meet the goals of preserving the small town character of port townsend lowering construction and maintenance costs and reducing impervious surfaces while at the same time assuring that local access streets are safe and have adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities  2 adopt standards for local access streets that strike a balance between initial expense and longterm operations and maintenance costs  and 3 promote nonmotorized travel and create an integrated network of bicycle and pedestrian pathways that provide incentives to walk or bicycle across town cit is further found that the acquisition construction and improvement of streets and other transportation facilities to serve new developments in the city of port townsend imposes a major burden upon city taxpayers  that as an urban growth area the city expects to experience an increasing intensity of land use and population growth which creates an increased demand for city transportation system services  that existing and projected city funds are inadequate to meet future projected transportation needs  that a failure to ensure that adequate transportation system improvements are made as traffic and street usage increases will cause safety problems impede commerce and interfere with the comfort and repose of the public  and that alternative methods of travel including a nonmotorized transportation network provision for public transit transportation demand management and other similar improvements are necessary to reduce the demands on and the costs of maintaining the street network dit is further found that the city has the authority under existing law to condition development and require rightofway and transportation system improvements where reasonably necessary to mitigate the direct impacts of a proposed development or use and that it is appropriate and desirable to set out standards for development in this title and in an adopted engineering design standards manual eit is further found that it may not be in the best interest of the public to improve all currently platted streets therefore certain rightsofway may be designated by the city for bicycle and pedestrianonly connections public access to vistas and shorelines stormwater facilities traffic calming utility easements and other uses  provided however that this policy shall not be construed as preventing the opening of rightsofway so as to deprive property owners of reasonable access to their property fit is further found and declared that the regulations contained in this title are necessary to ensure that public health safety and welfare will be preserved by having an adequate transportation system serving new and existing development by requiring that all development mitigate transportation impacts which may include constructing improvements that have been identified as a consequence of a proposed development or use  to provide for the equitable sharing of private improvement costs  to promote the orderly and economic development of the citymaintained transportation network and to otherwise protect the public health safety and welfare   purpose  authority the purpose of this title is to establish athe authority of the city to require any person 1 applying for a building permit or other development permit required under ptmc titles 16 17 or 18 2 seeking to temporarily use a public rightofway for vehicle access 3 seeking to open develop or improve any rightofway or easement for bicycle or vehicular traffic or 4 proposing other transportationrelated improvements within the rightofway to apply for and receive a street development utility permit as a prerequisite to development to comply with the terms and conditions of such permit and to conform to the requirements of the engineering design standards manual  bpredictable clear uniform and consistent procedures and permitting requirements that apply to all developments for the provision of safe and adequate access  ccriteria which will be used to determine the nature extent and location of required rightofway and transportation system improvements  da procedure for the public works director to grant on a casebycase basis a waiver or modification of or variance from the requirements of this chapter this authority is based on a recognition that variances from the required standards may be necessary or appropriate in certain cases and that where a proposed deviation from certain engineering design standards is minor or appropriate it is desirable to give the public works director the discretion to waive or modify technical compliance with such standards  and ethe authority of the public works director to impose conditions upon development to mitigate the problems caused by a particular development or use the basis for this authority comes from the following statutes of the state constitution  ptmc title 18 and rcw subdivisions ptmc and c rcw sepa ptmc esa ordinance rcw 35a and 35a the international fire adopted in ptmc title 16 and all other applicable federal state and

this section exh a 2012      private uses in the rightofway the city of port townsend encourages minor landscaping and planting of trees along public streets and in unopened rightsofway a property owner may perform minor landscaping in the rightofway abutting the owners property without need for a permit subject to and so long as the landscaping conforms to and meets the requirements standards and conditions of this section a property owner may plant trees along public streets and in unopened rightsofway upon obtaining a permit subject to and so long as the planting conforms to and meets the requirements standards and conditions of this section the city prohibits with limited exceptions provided for in this section private structures in the rightsofway including but not limited to fences sheds garages storage containers propane tanks wood piles whether on a temporary or permanent basis astructures in the rightofway 1unless authorized by other city regulations for example special use permit temporary fence it is prohibited to locate private structures in the rightsofway including but not limited to fences sheds garages storage containers propane tanks wood piles private no parking signs etc whether on a temporary or permanent basis exception mailboxes or house numbering are allowed uses of the rightofway and do not require a permit they must be located as determined appropriate by the public works director based on due regard for safety and parking 2if a structure appears to have been inadvertently located in the rightofway many years ago the city manager in consultation with the public works director is authorized to enter into a temporary use agreement to allow the structure to remain until the property redevelops and subject to such conditions as the city manager determines are appropriate until the property redevelops means at a minimum where costs of improvements exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the structures on the property over a fiveyear period for example a corner of a garage built decades ago encroaches into the rightofway by a foot apparently as a result of an inaccurate survey or having been located without survey the city manager may enter into a use agreement to allow the garage to remain until such time at the property redevelops nothing would prevent the garage from being maintained if the cost of new development or additions on the property exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the structures on the property over a fiveyear period the garage encroachment would be required to be removed this authority is limited to substantial structures garages buildings and does not extend to allowing use agreements for fences propane tanks woodpiles sheds and the like btemporary fences in the rightofway 1the public works director is authorized to permit temporary fencing in the rightofway 2temporary fencing would be for the purpose of protecting plantings in the rightofway for example against animals dogs deer or pursuant to a construction permit it is not for the purpose of providing privacy 3any temporary fencing must meet the following requirements and standards atemporary fencing requires a permit issued by the public works department btemporary fencing shall not interfere with parking or sight lines and shall not significantly interfere with pedestrian access ctemporary fencing cannot use permanent features for example posts set in concrete dtemporary fencing is limited in duration the public works director is directed to set terms and conditions to ensure that fencing is temporary cminor landscaping in the rightofway  no permit required the graphic at the end of this section entitled residential street use graphic illustrates some of the features of

includes planting a tree or trees is subject to subsection d of this section planting trees in the rightofway  permit required and requires a nofee permit 2minor landscaping minor landscaping is landscaping that meets the following standards adoes not interfere with streetside parking or pedestrian traffic within eight feet of the edge of any street in this area only grass or similar ground cover is appropriate bdoes not interfere with sight lines at intersections or otherwise present a hazard csoftens the streetscape and beautifies the planting strip or area between the street and property line or sidewalk or curb and property line dgenerally consists of low plantings and does not serve as a screen to prevent passersby from viewing structures on private property plantings or features that do not meet this standard would have the effect of privatizing the public space see graphic at end of section for illustration owners who desire privacy would erect fencing or plant landscaping on private property and not in the rightofway edoes not consist of plantings or features that form a fence or solid hedge or screen plantings and features must generally be spaced and provide an open look such plantings or features that do not meet this standard would have the effect of privatizing the public space fmay consist of landscape features wood rocks that are consistent with these standards 3the following descriptions are not requirements but are intended as defining landscaping and features that would fit within the definition of minor landscaping it is not required that these descriptions be adhered to in each and every instance however if they are adhered to they are a safe harbor so the owner knows that he or she is in compliance with city requirements adoes not exceed and is maintained not to exceed three feet in height except within 10 feet of an intersection or a driveway where it shall not exceed and is maintained not to exceed two feet in height heights are measured from original grade and not from the addition of any material exception to allow for some variation in height for every 25 feet of frontage minor landscaping may extend up to five feet in height for a distance not to exceed five feet in width this exception does not apply to the area within 10 feet of an intersection bdoes not interfere with parking next to a developed street landscaping shall be located at least eight feet back from the edge of the developed street to allow this area to be used for parking the parking area may be planted with low grass or ground cover so long as the plantings do not interfere with parking cdoes not create or have the effect of creating a private enclosed area screen wall or hedge landscaping that is at least 50 percent open viewed from above and from a crosssection is considered not to create a private enclosed area screen wall or hedge see graphic at end of section for illustration dmay include minor features such as timbers

and provisions aparking area no landscaping can interfere with parking next to a developed street see above for standards bdrainage utilities and city improvements no landscaping can have the effect of adversely affecting any drainage any public or private utility or any city improvements dplanting trees in the rightofway  permit required 1permit required a property owner may plant a tree or trees in the rightofway abutting the owners property if he or she first obtains a permit from the city public works department there is no charge for the permit the procedure allows the city public works department to review the type of tree and the planting location the public works director may develop and maintain standards and policies that govern the issuance of permits and develop requirements for permit applications 2standards for planting trees in the rightofway standards applied by the public works director for tree planting shall give due regard to the following criteria both at the time of planting and into the future as the tree matures atrees should not be planted in a manner that creates a safety issue or problems with sight distances for vehicles btrees should not cause problems with utilities ctrees should not cause substantial interference with views dtrees should be planted with due regard to the size and shape of tree and the topography location and surroundings and the need for spacing between trees eno trees or other vegetation shall be allowed to overhang or prevent the free use of the sidewalk or roadway or street maintenance activity except that trees may extend over the sidewalk when kept trimmed to a height of eight feet above the sidewalk and 14 feet above a roadway 3city may assume ownership of tree the public works director may assume control and ownership of any tree planted pursuant to this section this may be done for instance if the director determines that the trees provide a significant public amenity or that such ownership better assures the survivability of the tree city ownership only occurs if the same is documented in a writing signed by the public works director 4removal of trees in the rightofway  permit required any person who desires to prune or remove any tree or remove shrubs or other vegetation from the rightofway except for minor landscaping shall first obtain a permit from the public works department there is no charge for the permit but the procedure allows the city public works department to review and determine the appropriateness of the pruning or removal the public works director may develop and maintain standards and policies that govern the issuance of permits and develop requirements for permit applications the requirements of this subsection do not apply to the removal of minor landscaping 5standards for tree removal or pruning in reviewing a request to remove or prune a tree the director shall give due regard to the following criteria awhether the tree is dead diseased dying or dangerous bwhether the tree was a volunteer was planted by an abutting owner or was planted pursuant to a city program cwhether the tree is of a type not suitable for the location for example a fir tree growing under or into power lines may be suitable for removal dwhether the tree is a suitable for the location for example lombardy poplars may not be suitable street trees eimpact on surrounding properties and public spaces fwhether removal improves the environment for example the director may approve thinning of trees or say removal of small alders if this improves the environment for remaining or other species conditions that do not warrant pruning or removal tree is perceived as too large or tall or obstructs views or is perceived as making too much shade  provided some limited pruning or removal may occur if overall canopy and coverage of trees is not substantially affected for example if there are a number of trees blocking a view or a number of trees in the immediate vicinity the director may authorize a limited removal of a few trees to allow some view enhancement 6conditions removal may be on such conditions as the director deems reasonable and may include arequirement that the removal be done by a licensed contractor bagreement and liability insurance insuring the city from claims which may arise from or be related to the removal in amount and form acceptable to the city attorney cremoval of stumps and roots and treating the remaining roots with a suitable compound to prevent future growth dagreement for replanting see replanting requirements below 7replanting requirements the following replanting requirements shall apply aif the tree that is removed is dead diseased dying or dangerous no replacement is required bif the tree is not dead diseased dying or dangerous two trees for each tree removed replacement trees are subject to public works approval trees shall be three inches diameter measured 12 inches above natural ground level the public works director may waive or reduce requirements based on lack of space topography location type and size of tree removed or whether removal improves the environment or other similar factors for example the director may without requiring replanting approve removal of small alders if this improves the environment for remaining or other species cplanting may be on such conditions as the director deems appropriate and may include covenants on property that provide for maintenance and replanting if the tree does not survival for five years econditions  abutting owner responsibility and liability 1the owner or abutting owner means the owner of the abutting property and the owner andor any person firm or corporation occupying or having charge or control of the abutting property 2any use of the rightofway is subject to the following athe use confers no permanent right of use or ownership of the rightofway ball use is at the owners risk and is subject to revocation and requirement by the city that the owner remove it the city normally would provide a minimum of 30 days notice to the owner to remove any use except in cases of hazard or emergency or flagrant violation when other notice or no notice may apply removal may occur whether the city develops the rightofway for other purposes the city reserves the right to remove the use andor notify the owner that a failure to remove may be enforced in this chapter cif city work trail street utility etc occurs in the areas of any use there is no requirement to restore the use for example landscaping or temporary fencing the city may restore the area to rough grading not to preexisting condition and is not obligated to replace lost or damaged plants or materials dwhenever any injury or damage to any person or property shall be caused by the use the owner andor any person firm or corporation occupying or having charge or control of the abutting property shall be liable to the city for all claims damages or injuries costs and disbursements which the city may be required to pay to the person injured or damaged which sums shall include all costs and attorneys fees incurred by the city in defense of any action provided the abutter shall have no liability in the event that the dangerous defective or hazardous condition was caused created or constructed by the city or its employees and the condition created by the city hasnt thereafter been changed by any act of the abutter eif the city determines a hazard exists the city may require removal or that the owner provide liability insurance insuring the city from claims which may arise from or be related to the condition in amount and form acceptable to the city attorney fthe city may record a notice to title on the owners property notifying the public that the use occupies city rightofway and is subject to the requirements standards and conditions of this section fdepartures 1authority to grant departures the public works director shall have the authority under limited circumstances to grant a departure from the requirements of this section 2application requests the persons seeking a departure shall prepare and submit an application to the city on forms provided by the city 3public works directors decision within 30 days of receipt of a complete application the public works director shall make a determination to grant the departure grant the departure under certain delineated conditions or to deny the departure for good cause the director may extend the time for determination 4criteria a departure may be from all or part of the requirements of this section may require other standards to be satisfied by the applicant and may be subject to any conditions which the public works director deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this section in the public interest safety and welfare in making a determination the public works director may grant a departure only upon specific written findings of fact and conclusions showing that the following conditions exist athe departure is reasonable based on circumstances relating to the size shape topography location or surroundings of the subject property or to provide it with uses permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zoning district in which the subject property is located  and bthe granting of the departure will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located by way of illustration a departure might be warranted ito allow a retaining wall in the rightofway if reasonably necessary to prevent erosion from interfering with or damaging the rightofway iito allow a stairway to reach an existing structure above or below the grade of the rightofway might be permitted if other nearby owners have similar stairways to reach structures on their properties by way of further illustration it is not the intent of this section that a departure would allow an owner to landscape in the rightofway beyond the minor landscaping standards simply because a neighbors property has extensive longstanding landscaping in the rightofway if this situation justified a departure then no standards would apply because of the large number of such landscaping situations that have developed in the rightofway over time for uses or structures that were established before  the date of adoption of the citys zoning code that implemented the comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to requirements of the growth management act the council provides direction that the public works director would not prioritize any code enforcement for these uses so long as the use or structure did not present a safety hazard was removed if it interfered with city improvements did not interfere with views from street ends was not intensified and was removed if the property redeveloped such uses or structures could receive normal maintenance and repair but could not be reconstructed such uses or structures would be brought into conformance with city code upon a substantial redevelopment of the property it is not the intent of this section that the public works department seek out andor abate longstanding conditions or situations that violate the standards in this section so long as the use or structure did not present a safety hazard was removed if it interfered with city improvements did not interfere with views from street ends was not intensified and was removed if the property redeveloped subject to these limitations longstanding landscaping or trees in the rightofway would be allowed to remain 5the public works directors decision shall be made by written findings and

it is determined that the waiver or modification will not harm or will be beneficial to the public in general and that one or more of the following conditions are met 1location in an environmentally sensitive area as determined by ptmc disruption of existing drainage patterns or removal of natural features such as significant trees or vegetation makes widening andor improving the street or rightofway impractical or undesirable 2the existence of a structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the street or rightofway impractical or undesirable 3widening andor improving the street or rightofway would eliminate street access to an existing lot 4widening andor improving the street or rightofway would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where  1 development standards cannot reasonably be met  or 2 under which the property owner will have no reasonable use of the property 5one or more structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the street or rightofway and the structures condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the street or rightofway unlikely 6widening andor improving the street or rightofway is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot for example due to an inability to meet the required maximum driveway slope 7widening paving or street frontage improvements are unnecessary because 1 the street is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic for example due to the limited number of lots served by the development or 2 the development is on a street that is already developed at or near its zoned capacity and the improvements would provide little public benefit 8the specific design of the future street is currently unknown making immediate improvement impractical and undesirable 9the installation of the required improvements would likely cause unacceptable significant adverse environmental impacts that may not be mitigated as determined by the sepa official and the waivermodification would avoid such impacts 10there is insufficient street or rightofway adjacent to the lots and easement access cannot be obtained across private property 11there is no street or rightofway adjacent to the lots and easement access can be obtained across private property 12in the case of engineered plans for street construction when the public works department determines that engineering is unnecessary due to the limited extent of the improvements where short or deadend streets have no foreseeable need to be joined to the citys existing street network at a future date or where storm drainage concerns are not at issue or are a minor issue 13application of the requirements of the engineering design standards manual as applied to a particular development would conflict with goals and policies of the port townsend comprehensive plan 14it is determined that development of the property will create impacts which can only be later mitigated of an areawide or neighborhood improvement and it would be unreasonable to require the full improvement as a condition of the development 15it is determined that the street frontage improvements required in the engineering design standards manual could best be accomplished by construction of

transportation concurrency management provisions of the comprehensive plan 2 2005  intent this chapter implements rcw 3670a070 which requires that cities establish level of service standards and ensure that level of service standards are met or that funding of adequate improvements or efforts to reduce the demand for the facilities or services is assured before new development is approved the

one development permit the transportation concurrency determination shall occur prior to the issuance of the first development permit da transportation concurrency determination shall be required for a change in use or modification to an existing building or site if the new use or modification in combination with the existing use generates impacts as identified in subsection b of this section for purposes of this chapter a change in use or modification to an existing building will be subject to a transportation concurrency determination for the new increase in demand for the new facilities only a transportation concurrency determination for a new increase in demand for facilities or services will be performed at the time a complete application for the new demand is received by the city eno reservation of transportation capacity will be approved for a change in use which is otherwise not permitted pursuant to the citys zoning code and official zoning map fa transportation concurrency determination shall be valid as long as the development permit to which it applies is valid and any change to the proposed development does not change the impact as measured by the level of service  provided that if the development has not received a building permit and the development permit does not have an expiration date then the concurrency determination will be valid for five years from the approval date of the development permit gthe impacts of new development will be measured in terms of the transportation capacity removed or added to the level of service standards defined in ptmc  and adopted in the port townsend comprehensive plan hany development subject to transportation concurrency review shall be granted concurrency approval if pursuant to this chapter an adequate level of service will exist after the developments transportation facility impacts are added to 1 the sum of existing transportation facility usage and 2 the cumulative impacts of all other development in the city for which development approval or transportation concurrency approval has been granted but which have not been built or occupied and 3 the cumulative demand for new transportation facilities due to developments outside of the citys boundaries the capacity of the citys transportation facilities for use in determining transportation concurrency shall include the planned capacity of the transportation projects in the capital facilities and utilities and transportation elements of the comprehensive plan and other adopted facility plans which are reasonably funded iif transportation concurrency approval is granted the city shall reserve the capacity required for the development at the time of the concurrency determination this capacity shall not be returned to the system unless and until the application is for whatever reason denied rejected invalidated or abandoned  or the city determines that the reservation of capacity to be rescinded under the provisions of ptmc  certificate of transportation concurrency reservation of capacity will only be granted if the development is determined by the city to have a complete application jif the transportation concurrency determination results in a finding that the impacts of the proposed development will cause the citys overall transportation facilities to fall below the adopted standards the application for concurrency approval shall not be granted  provided that the applicant may accept a single 90day reservation of available capacity and within the same 90day period amend the application so that one or more of the following conditions are met and made conditions of approval 1mitigating measures needed to meet the level of service standards are identified in an impact study eg approved traffic study and the project development provides the financial commitment to guarantee the funding of the approved mitigating measures and the anticipated completion date of construction of the mitigating measures for cityowned roads and transportation facilities the completion of construction shall not be more than six years from the date of the development permit approval 2the applicant reduces the traffic impacts to achieve an acceptable level of service by a reduction of the size or intensity of land uses delay for the committed facility construction or phasing the development to match future facility construction 3the applicant reduces the impacts to achieve an acceptable level of service by scaling the project down by reducing the demand for new facilities or by providing ways to utilize facilities that are not at capacity the city shall provide a written statement of the reason for denying an application under this section 2 2005  transportation concurrency management appeals any

certificate of transportation concurrency aa certificate of transportation concurrency shall be issued by the director for each application that is granted concurrency approval under this chapter bcertificates of transportation concurrency shall be issued in the order of their review and approval the purpose of this section is to enable applicants who are ready for approval to receive a certificate of transportation concurrency even if their application was submitted after an earlier applicant it is the citys intent to treat applications on a firstcome firstserved basis but to use this section to avoid delays in approval of development caused by applicants who are unable to complete the review process due to their own action or inaction cupon issuance of a certificate of

shutoff of water or sewer does not constitute termination of service csurcharge means a fee billed to each utility account other than the base rate or volume charge the use of which is specifically established by the city council exh b 2016  property owner liable for accounts except as provided in ptmc  in all cases of utility service to residential or commercial rental property the property

customer that is larger than fiveeighths inch to threequarters inch has been installed for the convenience of the city the customer shall be assessed a base rate only for the size of the meter that would have been installed if the city had not requested a larger meter the citys public works department shall provide the finance department the information as to what size meter would have been installed if the city had not requested a larger meter cvolume charge 1all properties physically connected to the citys water system that are actually receiving water shall pay a volume charge according to the schedule adopted by this section if water has been temporarily shut off the property shall not be billed a volume charge 2meter reading shall be done on a monthly basis should there be a period during which meter readings cannot be obtained under a normal reading schedule the volume charge shall be calculated by averaging the prior consumption for the two months immediately preceding the period for which a meter reading cannot be obtained charges for the next month during which actual meter readings are taken shall be adjusted for the difference between the average and the actual metered volume for the twomonth period involved together with the appropriate meter rate where there is a circumstance which in the reasonable judgment of the finance director would make

engineering design standards manual reservations within adopted service area only reservation requires water availability conditions of approval regarding reservations payment of certain fees required for issuance of water reservation  creation of waiting list and refunds life of water reservation  extension relinquishment of water reservation administrative decisions  appeals limitation on actions  purpose athis chapter is intended to provide an orderly system for commitments to provide water supply to property owners located within the water utilitys outsideofcity service area it is the intention of this chapter that a system of water reservation be established which will provide certainty regarding water service to those who are ready to use it at or near the time they obtain a reservation or commitment for service from the water utility while at the same time preserving the ability of the water utility to provide reliable service to its existing customers this system is necessary to allow those who have partially developed properties adjacent to existing water infrastructure to have an opportunity in future years to obtain water supply and to avoid system capacity being reserved for large vacant parcels at a pace greatly exceeding actual rates of growth and development in the outsideofcity service area bthis chapter is further intended to provide a system for commitments to provide water supply to be perfected by actually paying all charges under this chapter payment of these charges is intended to allow the city to have the funds in hand necessary to complete major improvements to the water system such as providing increased storage capacity upgrading the sizes of existing main lines and other systemwide improvements necessary to accommodate growth concurrently with the actual need for service and to create a disincentive to speculative reservations of water in advance of actual development of the property and need for the water service due to the limited supply of city water and the fact that water supply would soon be overcommitted if speculative reservations of water are allowed to occur and continue in significant numbers the process established in this chapter also provides for relinquishing of the temporary commitment to provide supply if the water is not actually beneficially used within a reasonable period of time

an application for a preliminary plat final plat a discretionary land use permit or a building permit has been filed and is being pursued concurrently with the application for water reservation no new taps for irrigation purposes only shall be granted in the outsideofcity service area after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter the director of public works may require that a fully engineered plan to provide service be prepared by a civil engineer licensed in the state of washington as part of the application when in the directors judgment such a plan is necessary to determine the amount of water which is to be temporarily reserved andor it is necessary to allow the proposed water system to be integrated into the existing city water supply system the director of public works may establish such other requirements for applications and system design as are reasonably necessary to determine the amount of water to be reserved or to insure proper design of the system such requirements may include the design and implementation of reasonable water conservation measures bthe application requirements and system design requirements for water system improvements are contained in the engineering design standards manual adopted in ptmc as well as other applicable sections of this code exh a 2010    reservations within adopted service area only athe director of public works may only allow reservations of water service within the service area established by the city coordinated water system plan cwsp designation process the city council may however on an emergency basis either reduce the service area specified in the cwsp or halt the reservation of future water supply where failure to do so would result in overcommitment of the available supply in advance of capital facility construction necessary to provide the supply or where the system will be unable to provide a reliable supply of water to existing customers or those who have already made temporary reservations of water supply the emergency modification of the service area or the halting of reservation of water supply shall be established by resolution of the city council consistent

individual residential district are as follows 1ri  low density singlefamily this district accommodates singlefamily residences including duplexes triplexes and fourplexes at a density of up to four dwelling units per 40000squarefoot area ie 10000squarefoot minimum lot size or approximately four dwelling units within one block of platted land it allows four or fewer singlefamily dwelling units to be contained within one structure upon condition of sufficient tract size 20000 square feet for a duplex  30000 square feet for a triplex  and 40000 square feet for a fourplex limited multifamily development could occur with approval of a planned unit development this zoning district has been applied only in the northwestern portion of the city because of stormwater related development constraints the district accommodates singlefamily development at densities that maintain and promote the small town character of port townsend while ensuring that the environmental quality particularly as it relates to stormwater control of the area is not adversely impacted higher densities could be permitted in these areas of a planned unit development rpud overlay designation pursuant to ptmc 2rii  medium density singlefamily this district accommodates singlefamily dwellings including duplexes triplexes and fourplexes at a density of up to eight units per 40000squarefoot area ie 5000squarefoot minimum lot size or approximately eight dwelling units within one block of platted land it allows four or fewer singlefamily dwelling units to be contained within one structure

dimensional and density requirements  purposes amixed use districts the general purposes of the mixed use districts are as follows 1to foster a development pattern offering direct convenient pedestrian bicycle and vehicular access between residences and businesses in order to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle travel and reduce the number and length of automobile trips  2to encourage new development that supports the safe and efficient movement of goods and people  3to provide for a compatible mix of singlefamily multifamily housing and neighborhood commercial businesses and services with an emphasis on promoting multistory structures with commercial uses on the ground floor and multifamily housing on upper floors  4to promote a compact growth pattern to efficiently use the remaining developable land and to enable the costeffective extension of utilities services and streets  frequent transit service  and to help sustain neighborhood businesses  5to foster the development of mixed use areas that are arranged scaled and designed to be compatible with surrounding land uses and which provide sensitive transitions between significantly different land uses eg commercial and residential uses  6to ensure that buildings and other development components are arranged designed and oriented to facilitate pedestrian access bthe purposes of the specific mixed use districts are as follows 1cimu  neighborhood mixed use center this district provides for a compatible mix of small scale commercial uses and medium density multifamily housing in multistory buildings within this district commercial uses should be located mainly on the ground floor of multistory structures with multifamily residential units above at a density of up to 16 units per 40000squarefoot area over time this district should promote neighborhood identity by providing a range of commercial retail and service opportunities within walking distance reducing reliance upon the automobile this district occurs in three locations in the city the southwest corner of the intersection of 49th street and jackman  the hastings and howard street intersection  and the san juan and f street intersection 2ciimu  community mixed use center while very similar to the neighborhood mixed use district this district accommodates a broader range of commercial uses and upper floor multifamily residential units at a density of up to 24 units per 40000 square foot area the ciimu district occurs in areas that are closer to the citys existing eastwest commercial corridor ie portions of both the east and west sides of discovery road from 7th street to 12th street  and the east side of kearney street from franklin to garfield street like the cimu district the ciimu district is intended to

preferences  colocation aoverview  location preferences certain areas of the city are more appropriate for the location of personal wireless service facilities because of the existing development in the area or on the site the types of buildings already existing at the site the existence of similar or compatible facilities at the particular site the commercial or industrial nature of the area the zoning designation of the area andor the technical suitability of the particular site locating facilities in such areas can reduce adverse visual and aesthetic impacts of personal wireless service facilities citywide and help protect the health safety and welfare of city residents therefore the location preferences and design criteria and guidelines and associated conditions of approval contained in this chapter are intended to ameliorate any potential visual aesthetic or neighborhood livability concerns while still facilitating growth of an industry that is important to the citys economic health and whose services are demanded by an increasing number of the citys residents businesses workers and visitors in order to facilitate the location of facilities at such preferred locations the permitting process is intended to be simpler and more expeditious than for secondary locations preferred location permits will be processed as a type ii administrative permit with notice and are appealable to the hearing examiner as more fully set forth in ptmc  and ptmc bcolocation encouraged it is also the policy of the city of port townsend to minimize the number of personal wireless service support structures and require colocation when appropriate the city will pursue all reasonable strategies to promote colocation of facilities including emergency service facilities

100 years ago without respect to topography environmental relationships or need for adequate provision of public urban services incremental development of a single lot or other action which by itself does not create undue impacts on the environment may create adverse impacts which require mitigation when combined with the cumulative effects of previous simultaneous or subsequent developments within a given area 2an individual project may have an adverse impact on the environment or public facilities or services which though acceptable in isolation may be found to require mitigation due to the projects impacts in combination with the effects of existing development in the immediate area or given the probable development of subsequent projects with similar impacts further the individual project may directly induce other developments due to a causal relationship which will adversely affect the environment 3incremental property development often creates increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff which may cause property damage safety hazards nuisance problems and water quality degradation in drainage basins which are comprised of poor soils for infiltration of stormwater it is the citys policy to protect existing natural drainage corridors and basins to the greatest extent feasible from adverse drainage impacts of new development bthe analysis of cumulative effects shall include a reasonable assessment of 1the present and planned capacity of such facilities as sewers parks schools streets utilities stormwater facilities and parking areas to serve the area affected by the proposal  2the capacity of natural systems such as air water light and land to absorb the direct and reasonable anticipated indirect impacts of the proposal  3whether an action or project when considered together with prior simultaneous or known future development allowed under existing development regulations will create undue impacts on existing public facilities cuntil a comprehensive stormwater control ordinance is adopted the following cumulative effects procedures shall apply in areas where existing facilities are inadequate to accommodate the cumulative effects of additional storm runoffs as determined by the director of public works in consideration with the director 1a drainage control plan shall accompany or be included with an environmental checklist andor request for any city action on a proposed project  2the drainage control plan shall examine the cumulative effect as well as the proportionate share of the projects anticipated impact on the volume and rate of stormwater discharge within the drainage basin containing the subject property  3approval of the most suitable method of drainage control shall be made by the city engineer or the public works department on a casebycase basis  4the city as a mitigation measure for probable cumulative stormwater impacts may require covenants running with the land giving the city an independent right to recover a proportionate share of expenses for future regional stormwater facilities within a subject propertys drainage basin or for remedying deficient drainage systems related to the subject property dan action may be conditioned or denied to lessen or eliminate its cumulative effects on the environment when considered together with prior simultaneous induced or known future development under established development regulations it is determined that a project will use more than its reasonable share of present and planned facilities services or natural systems  1996   1993  appeals

porous geologic formations which store surface water that has percolated into the soil ground water currently aquifers in port townsend are not used as a drinking water source this section provides protection measures to effectively maintain the quality of ground water by prevention of contamination so if needed in the future ground water may be used for agricultural or landscaping uses or as a potable drinking water source bclassification 1aquifer recharge areas are those lands in port townsend which have an aquifer of potential future or current use for drinking water or which are a part of a system which maintains or affects the water quality of a wetland or other significant surface body of water and which allows water to enter the soil and geologic materials in ways and in quantities that replenish natural ground water systems and aquifers 2aquifers are highly susceptible to damage when the overlying soils and geologic formations that filter surface waters feeding the aquifer are very coarse textured allowing rapid translocation of surface pollutants to the aquifer aquifers under fine textured soils and geologic formations are less susceptible to surface influences and pollution 3aquifers underlying areas that are currently developed or industrialized are more vulnerable to pollution than aquifers in undeveloped areas combining aquifer susceptibility indexes with vulnerability indexes allows identification of those areas most at risk aquifers with relatively high susceptibility indexes located in industrial areas have the highest potential to become a significant public health hazard high vulnerability is characterized by land uses which produce contaminants that may degrade ground water quality or reduce ground water quantity low vulnerability is characterized by land uses which will not affect ground water quality or quantity 4vulnerability to pollution is a function of depth of ground water permeability of soils and geologic formations

establishing minimum tree density requirements expressed as tree units per 40000 square feet or for larger lots percentage of canopy cover for applicable project proposals and tree conservation permit approvals per ptmc  and for certain tree removal activities that may be exempt from ptmc  but still require compliance with minimum tree conservation standards it is intended that the tree density requirements will be met primarily conservation of existing trees however in order to provide for continued flexibility in the design of new development in those situations where a developments design would preclude the retention of the required number of trees the use of replacement or supplemental tree planting is authorized the minimum tree density for each land use designation is specified in table d1 bsites with insufficient tree cover it is recognized that some sites may not contain a sufficient number of existing trees to meet the tree density standards set forth in table d1 in those situations additional trees shall be planted as necessary to achieve the minimum tree density requirements of this chapter unless an alternative tree retention plan is approved per subsection c of this section calternative tree conservation plans 1some lots sites or land uses provide valuable open space functions including but not limited to maintaining view corridors that may conflict with the planting dense stands of trees examples include portions of town that historically have had few trees such as happy valley  or some land uses such as crop or tree farming or gardening small animal husbandry recreational play fields etc which are dependent upon open space and solar access alternative tree conservation or planting plans that do not meet the strict requirements of the tables of this section may be proposed in such circumstances 2alternative tree conservation plans may be approved by the dsd director upon a showing to hisher satisfaction that adue to the physical characteristics of the site or those of contiguous properties andor due to the design goals of a particular development including but not limited to preserving solar access or maintaining the character of open grassland areas strict adherence to the tree conservation standards set forth in subsections a b d of this section would be inappropriate or unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this title or would be unreasonably burdensome upon the applicant  and bthe alternative plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter expressed in ptmc   and calternative plans must provide environmental recreational agricultural andor aesthetic benefits that are equal or greater to the tree retention standards contained in the tables in this section 3offsite mitigation and fees paid in

trees proposed for retention must meet the following minimum standards in order to be credited towards satisfying the tree density requirements of this chapter 1healthy trees over 24 inches in diameter at dbh or that are over 100 years of age shall be priority trees for preservation priority trees should only be removed if their retention is not feasible eg within footprint of likely future building area and not reasonable to modify building size or footprint  2the retained trees shall be equivalent to the average size species and age of the trees existing on the site prior to development or tree removal  3retained trees shall be predominantly dominant or codominant trees meaning fully branched and generally proportional in height and breadth for the tree age  4retained trees must be healthy and have no substantial evidence of disease unless identified as a habitat tree per subsection a9 of this section meaning that retained trees shall have a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay or hollow and no significant trunk damage and should have no significant crown damage  5trees should be selected for retention based upon a consideration of windthrow potential wildlife value aesthetics and compatibility with future development  6retained trees should be clustered wherever possible to maximize habitat value and to minimize windthrow strips of trees along a sites perimeter boundaries should be carefully evaluated for windthrow potential  7trees being retained in environmentally sensitive areas and associated buffers may be applied towards tree canopy retention or tree unit credit requirements  8trees must be windfirm in upon completion of development activities no significant root damage  and 9trees identified as having significant habitat value shall be priority trees for preservation regardless of the health or state of the tree such as trees with broken crowns ideal for eagle perching or snags especially along shoreline bluffs so long as such trees are not a danger to nearby buildings bhealth and quality of trees proposed for planting trees proposed for planting must meet the following minimum standards in order to be credited towards satisfying the tree density requirements of this chapter 1each tree shall be healthy stock and carefully planted in an appropriately sized planting area 2each required deciduous tree shall have a minimum of threequarterinch caliper within six inches of ground at time of planting 3each required evergreen tree shall have a minimum height of three feet at time of planting 4trees planted shall include a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees at a minimum 25 percent of the trees planted shall be coniferous 5to avoid potentially unhealthy monocultures the total number of any individual species of replacement tree planted shall not exceed 15 percent of the same species or 25 percent of the same genus of the total number of all replacement trees planted afor example red maple acer rubrum and silver maple acer saccharinum are two different species but they are the same genus acer maples many pests would not distinguish between a red maple or a silver maple but those that feed on maples probably will not attack oaks or firs 6where possible required trees should predominantly be selected from the native tree species dsd will maintain a list of native tree species     residential development tree location requirements atree locations outside residential residential subdivisions short plats planned developments condominium projects and cottage housing

establish a mechanism for implementing the provisions of b rcw the regulatory reform act regarding compliance conformity and consistency of proposed projects with the citys adopted comprehensive plan and development regulations in order to achieve this purpose the city council finds that 1given the extensive investment that public agencies and a broad spectrum of the public are making and will continue to make in the port townsend comprehensive plan and development regulations it is essential that project review start from the fundamental land use planning choices made in the comprehensive plan and regulations if the applicable regulations or plan identify the type of land use specify residential density and identify and provide for funding of public facilities needed to serve the proposed development and site these decisions at minimum provide the foundation for further project review unless there is a question of code interpretation the project review process including the environmental review process under c rcw and the consideration of consistency should start from this point and should not reanalyze these land use planning decisions in making a permit decision unless the city finds that the plan and development regulations do not fully foresee sitespecific issues and impacts identified use project application review 2comprehensive plans and development regulations adopted by the city under a rcw the growth management act subarea plans and environmental policies laws and rules adopted by the city the state and the federal government address a wide range of environmental subjects and impacts these provisions typically require environmental studies and contain specific standards to address various impacts associated with a proposed development such as building size and location drainage transportation requirements and protection of environmentally sensitive areas when the city applies these existing requirements to a proposed project some or all of a projects potential environmental impacts may be avoided or otherwise mitigated through the integrated project review process described in this chapter the director of the development services department dsd will determine whether existing requirements including the applicable regulations or plans adequately analyze and address a projects environmental impacts project review generally should not require additional studies and mitigation under c rcw where existing regulations adequately address a proposed projects probable significant adverse environmental impacts development regulations generally enable project review application of established scientific standards required studies and standard mitigation measures bdefinitions the following definitions shall apply
