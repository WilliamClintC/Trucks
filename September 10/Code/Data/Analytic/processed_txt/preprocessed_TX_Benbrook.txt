ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direct supervision of pat rutherford city secretary the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 12 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates

of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections

findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other

property is in a flood area i 7209   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter employs the following methods techniques andor provisions a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which

element of the benbrook comprehensive plan in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of development in the city of benbrook it is declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide the same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property for subdivisions in the city 2 neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby the park areas established by the city council and shown on master plan for the city shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein the primary cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their

show the area proposed to be dedicated the required dedication may be met by a payment of money in lieu of land when permitted or required by the other provisions of this section 2 the city council declares that development of an area smaller than two acres for public park purposes is impractical therefore if fewer than two hundred units are proposed by a plat filed for approval the developer shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount unless the dedication will increase the size of an existing park 3 in instances where an area of more than two acres are required to be dedicated the city council shall have the right to accept the dedication for approval on the final plat or to refuse same after consideration of the recommendation of the park and recreation board and planning and zoning commission and to require payment of cash in lieu of land if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development or if the recreation potential for that zone would be better served by expanding or improving parks 4 the dedication required by this section shall be made by filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instrument unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat if the actual number of completed dwelling units exceed the figure upon which the original dedication was based such additional dedication shall be required and shall be made by payment of the cash in lieu of land or by the conveyance of an entire number lot to the city c money in lieu of land dedication subject to approval of the planning and zoning commission a landowner responsible for dedication under this section may elect to meet the requirements of subsection b

section or any preceding ordinance which fund shall be known as the park land dedication fund 2 the city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section with reference to

refund of such sum computed on a per dwelling unit basis the owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement in writing or such right shall be barred f additional requirements definitions for neighborhood parks 1 any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses the following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable unless recommended in the comprehensive plan a any area primarily located in the one hundred yearfloodplain  b any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for recreational activities the above characteristics of a parkland dedication area may be grounds for refusal of any preliminary or final plat 2 drainage areas may be accepted as a part of a neighborhood park if the entire floodplain width is dedicated to the city and if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel if land is dedicated which is in the floodway fringe but not including the floodway then it shall count as onehalf of the requirement as set forth in subsection b1 of this section 3 each park shall have ready access to an improved public street 4 unless provided otherwise in this chapter an action by the city shall be by the citys planning and zoning commission 5 all parkland dedication shall be consistent with the standards as set forth in the comprehensive plan g credit for private parks if a developer desires to incorporate private park recreation or open space areas or amenities within their development they may request limited credit for these facilities against their public open space requirements a developer may request credit for any private park recreation or open space area but such private park recreation or open space amenities may never satisfy more than fifty percent of the total park and open space dedication requirement of this chapter h appeals decisions of the city planner in the implementation of this policy may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission and decisions of the planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the city council the standard for review of decisions shall be
