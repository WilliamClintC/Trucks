inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodcontrol efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality

the type and character of road which the tract abuts 4 the topography of the parcel being subdivided with an emphasis on trees and slopes 5 the physical characteristics of the surrounding area and whether or not the subdivision site is distinguishable from it 6 the development status of the surrounding sites 7 the visual character preferred for the tract that is whether it is better to see a lot of houses abutting the road or to hide some in rear areas to reduce the perceivable density of development 8 whether rear lots would set an undesirable precedent for nearby sites 9 the economic impact of requiring road construction as compared to using rear lots  8534 subdivision and land development  8534  10 the visual and physical impacts of road construction as compared to the use of access strips d design standards for rear lots 1 the length of the access strip shall be kept to a minimum and as a guide the preferred length is approximately equal to the depth of one lot which
