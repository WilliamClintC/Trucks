local climatic conditions and impose substantially the same requirements as are contained in the international model industry codes the unique local conditions as found and determined are as follows yuba city is located in the northern portion of the central valley the area is bounded to the north by the siskiyou mountains the west by the coastal mountains the east by the sierra nevada mountains and the south by the delta region these geographical factors and the areas proximity to the pacific ocean combine to determine weather and wind conditions that influence the area and can create a particularly hazardous fire situation four weather conditions routinely present themselves which can result in extremely dangerous fire situations that could result in widespread conflagration the four conditions are temperature relative humidity wind and fog temperatures in the yuba city area during the summer months are in the 90 degree fahrenheit range with high temperatures of 100 degrees being very common low relative humidity is a very important weather condition which can intensity fire behavior when relative humidities fall below 30% the potential for fire spread is significantly increased a recent review of data available from the national weather service of a recent 38month period revealed that the yuba city area experienced 403 days when the relative humidity was recorded at or below 30% wind velocity directly contributes to flame spread and the potential for conflagration winds in combination with relative humidities below 30% contribute to drying out fuels the yuba city area is subject to strong north winds which are usually very drying in nature a review was made of the days with relative humidity at or below 30% and winds of ten miles per hour or more using the same 38month period as was previously mentioned of the 403 days of 30% or below relative humidity 197 days also had winds that equaled or exceeded ten miles per hour the weather conditions described above have a direct influence on fire behavior high temperatures low humidities and wind singularly and in combination produce a potentially explosive fire situation in addition to the weather conditions described above the yuba city area also experiences very dense fog conditions in the wintertime the presence of dense fog poses significant response problems to emergency response vehicles obviously if dense fog is present response speeds must be reduced this reduction in response speed results in longer response times the longer it takes the fire department to arrive the larger the fire grows research using the same 38month period mentioned above was done to determine how many days of heavy fog the yuba city area experienced heavy fog was defined as onefourth of a mile visibility or less the data revealed that during the 38 months reviewed heavy fog occurred on 103 days it is important to note that the fog prone months of november and december were missing for two of the three years reviewed as a result of these findings of fact on local climatic conditions within the yuba city area the city council finds that the fire code provisions and the automatic sprinkler requirements herein established by this chapter are considered reasonable and necessary modifications as provided for in california health and safety 5b and 17958 et seq because of these serious concerns as reflected in the foregoing findings of fact it is important that for the effective protection of the citizenry and property within the city limits of the city of yuba city from the ravages of fire and the reduction of the potential for communitywide conflagration that the ordinance from which this chapter derives be enacted only with the enactment of these regulations can the reduction of the potential for communitywide conflagration and the protection of the citizenry and property within this jurisdiction be realized   2 1172017 chapter 6  parking meters to be enacted

aggressive and unsafe panhandling purpose and findings a the purpose and intent of this chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city of yuba city by imposing reasonable time place and manner restrictions on aggressive intrusive or unsafe panhandling while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens b aggressive and intrusive panhandling typically includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city council finds that an increase in aggressive panhandling throughout the city has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public but has also created an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder c the city council finds that panhandling from people in places where they are a captive audience in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid panhandling from others is problematic and presents a risk to the health safety and welfare of the public such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops as well as gasoline stations the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who panhandle money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property restricting panhandling in such places will provide a balance between the rights of panhandlers and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such panhandlings and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations d the city council finds that panhandling on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers drivers pedestrians and the general public panhandling on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems e the city council further finds that the practice of panhandling near driveways accessing shopping centers retail and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers drivers pedestrians and the general public the location of the panhandler near the driveway compromises the panhandlers safety impedes visibility and impairs a drivers ability to safely enter and exit drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems f this law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest the goal of this law is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling that have become an unwelcome presence in the city and to protect the safety of the general public   1 922014 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in

controlled substance paraphernalia   necessity of enactment as a consequence of the glamorization of paraphernalia associated with the use of controlled substances and the abhorrence with which many residents of this city view such glamorization and enticement of impressionable persons this city council finds that many residents of this city are being unwillingly subjected to paraphernalia displays which are to these persons objectionable and unpleasant the city council further finds that such unpleasantness is particularly acute when minors are present in the area where such displays are conducted as a consequence of the concern of these unwilling viewers for the welfare of this citys children because of the relatively recent proliferation of such drug related paraphernalia in this city and the immediate risk that impressionable young people will be unduly influenced by aggressive commercial marketing techniques being utilized with the subject paraphernalia it is the opinion of this city council that there currently exists within the city an eminent danger to the children of this city should drug related paraphernalia be available to minors without there simultaneously being available guidance from adults most likely to have the welfare of each individual minor in mind accordingly this city council determines that regulation of the availability of drug related paraphernalia to minors unaccompanied by an appropriate adult must be immediately regulated   minors no owner manager proprietor or other person in charge of any room in any place of

purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the public works director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days i a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  ii the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and iii steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance d in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof e users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails   2 6212016 b  bypass a for the purpose of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c bypass notifications 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the public works director at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the public works director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the public works director may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the public works director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of unwanted wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the public works director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the public works director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph d1 of this   2 6212016 enforcement response plan for industrial user noncompliance general overview a purpose of enforcement response plan this enforcement response plan erp in this article represents enforcement actions and their respective time frames that may be taken by the city of yuba city against an industry for noncompliance of permit conditions this chapter of the yuba city municipal federal and state regulations b definitions 1 major violationssignificant noncompliance snc any violation of pretreatment requirements limits sampling analysis reporting and meeting compliance schedules and regulatory deadlines is an instance of noncompliance for which the industrial user is liable for enforcement including monetary penalties instances of snc are industrial user violations which meet one or more of the following criteria i significant violations of wastewater discharge limits a chronic violations 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a sixmonth period exceeded by any magnitude a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits as defined in   b technical review criteria trc violations 33% or more of the measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a sixmonth period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits as defined by multiplied by the applicable criteria  there are two groups of trcs group i for conventional pollutants bod tss fats oils andor grease trc   14 group ii for all other pollutants except ph trc   12  c any other violations of pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by that the public works director determined has caused alone or in combination with other discharges interference eg slug loads or pass  or endangered the health of the sewage treatment personnel or the public  d any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human healthwelfare or to the environment or has resulted in the treatment plants emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge  e failure to meet within 90 days of the scheduled date a compliance schedule milestones contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for staring construction completing construction or attaining final compliance by 90 days  f failure to provide within 30 days after the due date any required reports including baseline monitoring reports reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines periodic selfmonitoring

notice of violation nov or a warning letter is sent via a certifiable means us mail fedex ups etc to the responsible party at the place of business a written response by the industrial user may be required which states the cause of the violation the corrective actions which will be taken to prevent recurrence and the time frame to complete corrective actions 1 if an industrial user fails to correct its problems if the violation appears to be a part of a recurring pattern or if the level of the violation is of a large magnitude a formal meeting will be arranged with representatives of the firm and the public works director or designee to discuss the problem or possible corrective actions at this time the firm may be issued an administrative order containing or requesting a time schedule for compliance and additional monitoring requirements andor fines 2 any industrial user who intentionally or willfully violates any provision of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter or intentionally or willfully discharges waste or wastewater which causes pollution or who violates any cease and desist order established effluent limitations national standard of performance or national pretreatment or toxicity standard shall be fined not more than $50000 for each offense the public works director after determining the existence of a violation may levy fines which shall be in accordance with this chapter of the yuba city municipal applicable state and federal law each day on which a violation may occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense 3 in instances where the firm is a significant violator in significant noncompliance or snc or in situations where a discharge may pose a threat to the safety of operation of the potw or its personnel the industrial user will be issued a cease and desist order this order issued by the public works director may order the firm to comply immediately or impose additional requirements on the industry 4 violations believed to be caused acts or intentional discharge of hazardous wastes as specified in 40 cfr 413 and 433 will be referred to the city attorney for further enforcement the city attorney may then petition the superior court of california county of sutter for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction as appropriate which restrains or compels the required performance d appeal

and grease discharge from food service establishments general overview purpose the purpose of this chapter is to facilitate the maximum beneficial public use of the citys sewer services and facilities while preventing blockages of the sewer lines resulting from discharges of fats oils and greases fog from residential industrial and food service establishments fse to the sewer facilities and to specify appropriate fog discharge requirements for fses   2 6212016 regulations a permits all nonresidential facilities including notforprofit and governmental facilities that prepare process or serve food as determined by the public works director or designee may be required to keep a valid wastewater discharge permit issued by the city as outlined in the provisions of 1 the wastewater discharge permit for any facility shall be renewed whenever there is a change in operation including facility expansion remodeling or change in ownership permits are issued for a specifically named establishment at a particular location and are not transferable 2 a limited food preparation establishment is not considered a fse and is exempt from obtaining a wastewater discharge permit exempt establishments shall be engage only in reheating hot holding or assembly of ready to eat food products and as a result there is no wastewater discharge containing significant fog a limited food preparation establishment does not include any operation that changes the form flavor or consistency of food b discharge limitations no fse shall discharge fog or cause fog to be discharged into the public sewer that causes an sso exceeds a concentration level set forth in or that may accumulate andor cause or contribute to blockages in the public sewer c prohibitions fses are prohibited from doing any of the following 1 installing food grinders in the plumbing system of new construction all fses that undergo a change in operations or remodeling shall remove any existing food grinders concurrent with such change or remodeling except as otherwise expressly allowed by the public works director  2 introducing any additives into an fses plumbing system grease trap andor grease interceptor for the purpose of emulsifying fog biologically andor chemically treating fog for grease remediation andor as a supplement to grease interceptor maintenance  3 disposing waste cooking oil into the public sewer or storm drain all waste cooking oils shall be collected and stored properly in receptacles such as rendering bins barrels or drums for recycling or other acceptable methods of

to evaluation of the following conditions 1 there is no adequate space for installation andor maintenance of a grease interceptor 2 there is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor andor between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the public sewer 3 the fse can justify that the alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in controlling its fog discharge d conditional waiver an existing fse may obtain a conditional waiver from installation of a grease interceptor if the fse demonstrates that it has negligible fog discharge and insignificant impact to the sewer system the public works director or designees determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 quantity of fog discharge as measured or as indicated by the size of fse based on seating capacity number of meals served menu

variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2 eff    2att a  3 9202016 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation of an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission

following regulations as contained in this necessary to mitigate unique local climatic conditions and impose substantially the same requirements as are contained in the international model industry codes the unique local conditions as found and determined are as follows yuba city is located in the northern portion of the central valley the area is bounded to the north by the siskiyou mountains the west by the coastal mountains the east by the sierra nevada mountains and the south by the delta region these geographical factors and the areas proximity to the pacific ocean combine to determine weather and wind conditions that influence the area and can create a particularly hazardous fire situation four weather conditions routinely present themselves which can result in extremely dangerous fire situations that could result in widespread conflagration the four conditions are temperature relative humidity wind and fog temperatures in the yuba city area during the summer months are in the 90 degree fahrenheit range with high temperatures of 100 degrees being very common low relative humidity is a very important weather condition that can intensity fire behavior when relative humidities fall below 30% the potential for fire spread is significantly increased a recent review of 38month period revealed that the yuba city area experienced 403 days when the relative humidity was recorded at or below 30% wind velocity directly contributes to flame spread and the potential for conflagration winds in combination with relative humidities below 30% contribute to drying out fuels the yuba city area is subject to strong north winds which are usually very drying in nature a review was made of the days with relative humidity at or below 30% and winds of ten miles per hour or more using the same 38month period as was previously mentioned of the 403 days of 30% or below relative humidity 197 days also had winds that equaled or exceeded ten miles per hour the weather conditions described above have a direct influence on fire behavior high temperatures low humidities and wind singularly and in combination produce a potentially explosive fire situation in addition to the weather conditions described above the yuba city area also experiences very dense fog conditions in the wintertime the presence of dense fog poses significant response problems to emergency response vehicles obviously if dense fog is present response speeds must be reduced this reduction in response speed results in longer response times the longer it takes the fire department to arrive the larger the fire grows research using the same 38month period mentioned above was done to determine how many days of heavy fog the yuba city area experienced heavy fog was defined as onefourth of a mile visibility or less the data revealed that during the 38 months reviewed heavy fog occurred on 103 days it is important to note that the fog prone months of november and december were missing for two of the three years reviewed as a result of these findings of fact on local climatic conditions within the yuba city area the city council finds that the residential building code provisions and the automatic sprinkler requirements herein established by this considered reasonable and necessary modifications as provided for in california health and safety 5b and 17958 et seq because of these serious concerns as reflected in the foregoing findings of fact it is important that for the effective protection of the citizenry and property within the city limits of the city of yuba city from the ravages of fire and the reduction of the potential for communitywide conflagration that this ordinance be enacted only with the enactment of these regulations can the reduction of the potential for communitywide conflagration and the protection of the citizenry and property within this jurisdiction be realized   2exh a 1172017   violations violations to this chapter will be penalized under the
