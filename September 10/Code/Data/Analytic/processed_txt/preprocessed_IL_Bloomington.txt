feet the city may determine 1 to accept the proposed land dedication 2 that the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes and the owner subdivider or developer will be required to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication 3 that the city desires to accept the proposed dedication and agrees to acquire additional land from the owner to increase the park size to 40 hectares 10 acres by paying the owner fair cash market value as described in  24703a for the additional acreage plus reasonable development costs incurred by owner to serve the additional land  b the cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the city or other public body designated by the city solely for the acquisition and development

agree to the fair market value 2 criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations in subdivision codes when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when a only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site that portion of the land within the subdivision code falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated b a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portion shall

of this restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment for adults to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material  375202 ch 375  findings the city council of the city of bloomington mclean county illinois makes the following legislative findings a the courts of illinois as well as the united states supreme court have recognized the citys authority to adopt rules and regulations over the operation of sexually oriented entertainment business establishments  and b the city has a substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare of its citizens and all persons within the city and of propounding standards to mitigate the possibility of infection by contagious sexually transmitted diseases  and c there is convincing documented evidence including statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities in the state of illinois and in the united states concerning the serious objectionable characteristics and secondary effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses located in other jurisdictions the city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting ordinances to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of sexually oriented entertainment business establishments  and d the city council finds that there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented entertainment businesses including  375201 general provisions  375202  but not limited to an increase in the crimes related to prostitution sale and possession of controlled substances and violence against persons and property these studies from other jurisdictions establish convincing evidence that sexually oriented entertainment business establishments if not regulated pursuant to the location and operational requirements set forth in the ordinances of the city can result in an increase in criminal activities and other adverse secondary effects with a deleterious impact on adjacent commercial and residential properties  and e the city council finds that enclosed or dimly lit areas within sexually oriented entertainment businesses greatly increases the potential for unlawful conduct such as prostitution sales of controlled substances and lewd and lascivious conduct and further finds that requirements for all indoor and enclosed public areas be open to view by management and visible to all other public areas in the sexually oriented entertainment business establishment adequate lighting and direct management supervision of such areas are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and incidents of illegal conduct and facilitate routine inspection by public safety personnel  and f the city council in adopting this is aware of and takes legislative notice of wellestablished legal principles related to the regulation of sexually oriented entertainment businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution but instead intends to enact reasonable regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and g the city council finds that location and zoning regulations alone are insufficient to adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thereby finds that it is in the public interest to establish certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and h the city council finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that close contact between performers and patrons and the direct solicitation of and the direct giving of gratuities in sexually oriented business entertainment establishments facilitates the opportunity for specified criminal acts including but not limited to solicitations for sexual acts transfer of controlled substances and lewd and lascivious conduct and further finds that the enforcement of such laws prohibiting such specified criminal acts requires a disproportionate level of public safety resources  and i the city council finds the following based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record 1 evidence supports a finding that some dancers and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts as defined herein in  375202 bloomington code  375202  sexually oriented entertainment businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in specified sexual activities with patrons of such sexually oriented entertainment businesses on the site of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  2 evidence demonstrates that performers employed by sexually oriented entertainment businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live entertainment exhibiting specified sexual activities or displaying specified anatomical parts as defined herein  3 evidence supports a finding that performers at sexually oriented entertainment businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the sexually oriented entertainment businesses  as a result of the above and in view of the increase in incidents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases std the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations that will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex at sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and j the city council finds that there are unique harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses including but not limited to the deterioration of respect for family values exposure to images and acts for which they are too young or immature to fully understand exposure to items and displays containing pornography or sexually oriented toys or novelties and the possibility that such children or minors could inadvertently become targets or otherwise victims of solicitations of a sexual nature for which they are too young or immature to understand or otherwise take appropriate measures to protect themselves  and k the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of sexually oriented entertainment businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city from increased criminal activity preserve the quality of life minimize adverse impacts on property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and commercial businesses and to deter the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases   375202 general provisions  375202  article iii definitions  375301 ch 375  definitions for the purposes of this unless the context clearly
