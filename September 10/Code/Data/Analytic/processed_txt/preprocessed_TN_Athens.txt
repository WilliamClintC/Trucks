regulations provide the local planning commission with uniform procedures and standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plans for land subdivision 2 who is affected by the regulations every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels or changes the size or shape of existing lots 3 am i affected if i resubdivide my tract into two parcels yes subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes resubdivision see for definition of subdivision 4 what is to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval the county register of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivisions lying within planning regions without final approval in writing 5 can i sell an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds no state law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by law to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale 6 what happens if i sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision a a state law has been broken tca 133410 b some cloud would exist on the title to the lot c most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans d state law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers water mains lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads e where zoning is in effect a building permit to construct any building will be withheld f any building or structure erected in violation may be forced to be vacated or removed 83 g the legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction or other legal action 7 what improvements will i need to install in my subdivision most subdivision regulations will require the developer to grade and improve streets install curbs and sidewalks monuments sewers and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications 8 why doesnt the lot buyer instead of the developer pay for improvements the lot buyer doesat the time they purchase their property if lots are sold before improvements are in the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements that should have been originally planned for and installed by the developer 9 wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of money quite the contrary properly planned subdivisions make the most of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a maximum number of wellarranged and easier sold lots good land subdivision affects the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor while saving the developer money 10 how do i go about having a subdivision approved your local planning commissions printed set of regulations include the procedure for having a plat approved the planning commission meets at regular intervals and your preliminary sketch is submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered it is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area 11 what if i wish to lay out a commercial or industrial subdivision the provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivisions of land including that for use of business and industry since space parking and service requirements will vary greatly it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses for that reason specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential areas 84 12 where can i get technical site planning assistance your planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision steps for a subdivision developer in the athens planning region 1 confer with the planning commission and its staff representative to become thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements the major street plan and other public improvements which might affect the area to be subdivided 2 subdivider may submit sketch plans and data prior to preparing plat 3 have preliminary plat prepared by a licensed engineer or surveyor this

see for requirements 8 present drawings to the city of athens local utilities board and appropriate state agency for approval 9 when written approval is granted  obtain permit for construction no charge 10 develop subdivision according to approved plans and specifications a performance bond may be posted with the city manager in sufficient amount to cover the total cost of improvements prior to improvements being installed the city manager and city staff will determine the amount of the bond final plat approval may be given and permits issued however the bond will not be released until all improvements are made certifications issued and the streets and utilities accepted by the athens city council 11 call for the city of athens and local utilities board inspection during the progress of construction as per approved specifications 85 12 upon completion of improvement prepare final plat 13 obtain signed certification from director of public works local utilities board and county health department if applicable 14 submit a final plat prepared signed and stamped by a tennessee licensed surveyor to the athens regional planning commission for approval 15 athens regional
