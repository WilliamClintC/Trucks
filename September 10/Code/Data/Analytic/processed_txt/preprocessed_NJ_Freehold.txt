municipalities have responsibilities concerning the need to provide affordable housing for low and moderateincome households  2 the legislature conferred upon the new jersey council on affordable housing coah primary jurisdiction for the administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional planning considerations in this state njsa d304 a  3 in mount laurel ii the new jersey supreme court ruled that municipalities had the power to address the mount laurel responsibilities that the court had created inclusionary devices and rejected the notion that inclusionary measures amount to a taking without compensation see mount laurel ii at 271  4 in mount laurel ii the supreme court also stated zoning does not require that land be used for maximum profitability and on occasion the goals may require something less see mount laurel ii at 274 n 34  5 in the case entitled holmdel builders association v township of holmdel 121 nj 550 582 1990 the supreme court referred to  190224 freehold code  1902241  its mount laurel ii decision and emphasized that in designing inclusionary ordinances no density bonuses compensatory benefits or subsidies were specifically required  6 in view of the principles established by the supreme court in these landmark decisions coah recently adopted substantive regulations that authorized municipalities to impose a set aside without any density bonuses or other compensatory benefits pursuant to which municipalities could require residential developers to construct one affordable residential unit for every eight market residential units the developer constructed njac 44 a  7 coah specifically stated that a municipality may adopt a zoning ordinance requiring a maximum of one for every eight marketrate residential units be affordable to low and moderate income households as long as the zoning has not allowed an increase in density to accommodate affordable housing 36 njr 5775  8 coah has also authorized municipalities to require nonresidential developers to produce affordable housing without any enhancement or compensatory offsetting benefit based upon a formula that would require the production of one affordable residential unit for every 25 jobs projected to be created by the nonresidential development njac 44 a  9 the township of freehold wishes to ensure that as developers build residential and nonresidential projects they provide affordable housing consistent with coahs regulations and policies described above policies soundly rooted in supreme court precedent  and 10 implementation of
