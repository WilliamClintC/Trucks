tree preservation criteria the planning director shall consider the following factors and any other relevant information when evaluating tree preservation as shown on the landscape plan 1 the desirability of preserving a tree or group of trees by reason of age location size or species 2 whether the size or shape of the lot reduces the flexibility of the design 3 the general health and condition of the tree or group of trees or the presence of any disease injury or hazard 4 the placement of the tree or group of trees in relation to utilities structures and the use of the property 5 the need to remove the tree or group of trees for the purpose of installing repairing replacing or maintaining essential public utilities 6 whether roads utilities and building footprint are designed in relation to the existing topography and located where possible to avoid damage to existing tree canopy 7 construction requirements of onsite and offsite drainage 8 the extent to which development of the site and the enforcement of this article are impacted by state and federal regulations c tree preservation requirements the intent is to leave undisturbed as many existing significant specimen and heritage trees as possible further the number of trees required for mitigation shall be based upon the existing significant and heritage trees to be removed an inventory of existing trees on the site as required in section 3424 must be completed under the following guidelines on development sites of less than ten acres an inventory of the entire site is required on sites of more than ten acres 25 percent of the site or a minimum of ten acres whichever is greater must be surveyed a determination of the total number of trees significant specimen and heritage on the site will be derived from a multiple of the trees varieties found in the survey area applied to the entire site for the representative sampling method on larger sites the developer must provide a recently dated aerial photo of the site within the past three months so that the planning director or a designee can select the appropriate area or areas for conducting the inventory the inventory of the selected area or areas must be conducted by a licensed arborist and submitted to the planning director 1 for each existing significant tree removed the rate of mitigation is as follows a replacement trees shall be planted at rate of one twoinch caliper tree per five inches of trees removed measured at dbh b in the old town conservation overlay district and on sites greater than five acres replacement of heritage trees shall be planted at rate of one twoinch caliper tree per two inches of trees removed measured at dbh 2 for each existing significant specimen andor heritage tree retained the following credits shall be available a for each significant andor specimen trees retained extra credit shall be available for one twoinch caliper tree equal to the total dbh of all significant andor specimen trees retained divided by the rate of mitigation of five inches b for each tree grove retained extra credit shall be available for one twoinch caliper tree equal to the total dbh of all significant andor specimen trees retained within a tree grove divided by the rate of mitigation of five inches c in the old town conservation overlay district and on sites greater than five acres for each heritage tree retained extra credit shall be available for one twoinch caliper tree equal to the total dbh of all heritage trees retained divided by the rate of mitigation of one inch 3 the planning director may approve the use of trees less than twoinch caliper for the planting of medium tree species dogwoods and red buds andor greater than twoinch caliper on an equal total caliper basis eg two threeinch caliper trees equals three twoinch caliper trees 4 each development will have a ten percent credit applied before any mitigation is required for example if there were 1000 inches dbh of existing trees 100 inches could be removed without mitigation 5 trees in poor health andor hazard trees will not require mitigation if the condition is so determined by a designated city official and in the event of a dispute an international society of arboriculture isa certified arborist will make a determination at the expense of the developer 6 except for heritage trees in the old town

city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  9212010 findings of fact a the city is subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  9212010 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  9212010 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area  9212010 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help

pud includes a mix of residential uses types a commercial area and a country club with golf course a substantial modification to the pud was approved by the board of aldermen in october of 2005  and it was annexed into the city of oxford in 2006 the pud later split into two sections phase 1 and phase 2 in 2012  which are controlled by different developers but operating under the same development plan the underlying zoning established for this pud reflects the intended uses on the approved pud plats i grand oaks pud phase one most of this phase has been built there are a few areas of residential development remaining but the only area with substantial remaining undeveloped land is an area designated for commercial uses along the east side of highway 7 between grand oaks boulevard and industrial park drive ii grand oaks pud phase two there are substantial areas of still undeveloped property in this phase designated for residential uses there are central governing covenants and a single development entity managing remaining development in 2015 it was realized that underlying zoning had not been established for the annexed areas and that was applied  reflecting uses intended in the remaining sections the last adjustment to the pud plat was in 201 which changed the pud 2 site data sheet to reflect the latest changes to the parcels and still reflects a total of 2112 permitted dwelling units b blackberry hills pud this planned unit development was first approved as a pud in october of 2005 and annexed into the city of oxford in 2006 what has been development so far is primarily a residential development although portions are intended for mixed use development the portions along molly barr road and adjoining areas to the north have been substantially developed with a mix of attached and detached dwellings in cottage and townhouse styles the portions further to the southwest remain substantially undeveloped the underlying zoning established for
