consult early and informally with the planning commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the preliminary sketch plat and its formal application for approval this will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these regulations the major road plan and other official plans or public improvements which might affect the area such informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions a general 1 any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the planning commission who wishes to divide such land into two 2 or more lots
