at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i 74editors note see 35 ps  7527b  23828 general provisions  23829   23829 violations and penalties a civil penalties any user who is found to have violated the provisions requirements or pretreatment standards of this article the rules and regulations of the pennsylvania department of environmental protection or the environmental protection agency an order rule regulation or permit of the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington or the city of lower burrell whether or not the violation is willful or negligent may be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25000 per day for each violation regardless of jurisdictional boundaries each violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington or the city of lower burrell may recover its costs for reestablishing the operating of the potw in addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder in addition the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington or the city of lower burrell may recover attorneys fees all court costs and all other expenses of litigation to the extent permitted by law75 b civil penalty assessment policy 1 this section constitutes the civil penalty assessment policy required by the publicly owned treatment works penalty law herein penalty law act no 9 of 199 35 ps  7521 et seq when making determinations of the level of enforcement the city of lower burrell andor the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington shall take into consideration the following a damage to air water land or other natural resources and their uses b costs of restoration and abatement c savings to the user as a result of the violation d history of past violations e deterrence of future violations f other relevant factors as determined by the city of lower burrell andor the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington 2 a user must usually spend money to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements the user makes initial capital expenditures for pretreatment equipment or process changes and incurs subsequent operation maintenance and repair costs annually by delaying or avoiding these costs the user realizes and economic advantage or benefit over a competitor which complied with pretreatment requirements in a timely manner thus the 75editors note amended at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i  23829 lower burrell code  23829  economic benefit of noncompliance is defined as the difference between the cost of on time compliance and delayed compliance economic benefits realized by the user which fails to comply by a required deadline can be measured by a the money that the user would expect to earn by delaying the purchase of pretreatment equipment or implementation of process changes and investing the money in more profitable projects b the annual costs that the user avoids and the expected return on avoided costs during the period of noncompliance c any competitive advantage the user may gain such as increased market share over competitors already in compliance because of cost advantages attributed to delayed compliance 3 in this article the economic benefit calculation is focused on the first two benefits the guidance manual for potws to calculate the economic benefit of noncompliance us environmental protection agency  may be applied in calculating the penalty 4 consideration of the gravity and length of a violation is important when determining the penalty amount removing the economic benefit of noncompliance only places the violation user in the position it would have been had it complied on time both deterrence and fundamental fairness require that the civil penalty include an additional amount to ensure that noncompliance is more costly than compliance and the city of lower burrell andor the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensingtons policy will be to include such an amount 5 recovering for damages to public facilities andor natural resources a failure to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements may cause damage to the collection system of the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington damage may also be caused to the natural environment therefore an additional purpose of penalties in pretreatment enforcement shall be to recover for such damages specifically the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may determine to require that a violating user pay reparations for any damages caused to the collection system by improper disposal of pollutants such a user may also be required to pay for replacement of equipment facilities andor other damaged processes at the potw caused by pollutant interference  23829 general provisions  23829  b pollutants which pass interfere with potw processes may cause damage to natural systems in receiving waters in addition to assessing penalties to recover for such damages the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may consider requiring mitigation and remediation programs c the city of lower burrell andor the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will consider assessing higher penalties for violations resulting in actual or potential harm to the environment such potential environmental harm occurs whenever a user discharges a pollutant into the sewer system that  passes potw inadequately treated and causes a violation of the potws national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit including water quality standards  has a potentially toxic effect on the receiving waters eg a fish kill 6 cost of restoration and abatement some violations may have negative impacts on the potw itself for example such violations may result in significant increases in treatment costs interference harm potw personnel equipment processes or operations or cause sludge contamination resulting in increased disposal costs when a users noncompliance harms the potw the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will assess a larger penalty 7 savings to the user as a result of violation a user which fails to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements in a timely manner may accrue a significant economic benefit a penalty assessed against the violator will be fixed at a level to at least negate this economic benefit and make it unprofitable for the user to ignore or violate pretreatment requirements these requirements include installation of pretreatment equipment one time expenditures eg land and operation and maintenance o&m or other annual costs the economic benefit calculation described in this article will be applied to any or all types of pollution control costs 8 history of past violation a the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will consider each violation in assessing the significance of user noncompliance violations of average effluent limitations will be considered a violation for each day of the averaging period therefore a monthly average violation will be counted as 30 days of violation a weekly average violation as seven days of violation and a four  23829 lower burrell code  23829  day average should be counted as four violations violations of different parameters at the same discharge point or outfall are counted separately and violations at different discharge points or outfalls or indirect discharges are counted separately the amount of the penalty will be increased as the number of violations increases however as provided in the penalty law a single operational upset shall only be considered as one violation even though it may result in simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard b the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington shall consider increasing penalty amounts for continuing longterm violations generally a longterm violation is one that continues for three or more consecutive months in addition penalties will be higher for violations that have continued for three years than for violations that have only occurred for six months c significant noneffluent violations will be considered in assessing penalties violations included in this category include failure to report late reporting schedule violations failure to implement an approved pretreatment program laboratory analysis deficiencies unauthorized discharge operation and maintenance o&m deficiencies and sludge handling violations d the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will consider increasing the penalty amount when the violating user appears to be acting in bad faith eg by not cooperating with the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington in effecting a timely correction of the violation  when the user experiences unjustified delays in preventing correcting or mitigating violations  when the user has already violated prior administrative orders compliance agreements or consent decrees  or when the user fails to provide timely and full information this recalcitrance factor also may be increased during negotiation if the user continues to resist efforts to settle e when a user demonstrates that it is unable to pay a settlement penalty the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will independently evaluate the users ability to pay when it is determined that the user cannot afford to pay the penalty or that payment of all or part of the penalty will preclude the violator from achieving compliance the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may consider other options for example the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may consider an installment payment plan with the user paying  23829 general provisions  23829  interest only as a last recourse the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may consider reducing the penalty amount if the users behavior has been exceptionally culpable recalcitrant or threatening to human health and the environment inability to pay will be disregarded 9 deterrence of future violations a a user shall install the appropriate pollution control equipment to comply with applicable pretreatment regulations maintaining compliance required continuing o&m and other annual expenditures for users which fail to comply with pretreatment requirements the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will set its penalties at a level to remove at a minimum the economic benefit from avoided annual costs during its period of violations the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington hereby determines that assessing a penalty which as a minimum eliminates the economic benefit of noncompliance or makes noncompliance more expensive than compliance will encourage users to remain in compliance b the intent of these penalties is to deter noncompliance so that pollutant discharges by a user do not have significant negative impacts on the potw collection system or receiving waters the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensingtons policy will be not to assess a penalty that is too small eg less than the economic benefit of noncomplying so that the violating user and other users may determine that noncompliance is more expensive than compliance c the epa or dep can take enforcement action against a user violating the clean water act including federal pretreatment standards and regulations citizens or citizen groups can also bring civil suits against a user for violating environmental regulations if the violating user has been sued by the epa state regulatory agency or citizens or citizen groups and penalties were imposed upon the user from these actions the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington may consider reducing the penalty by an amount equal to that which the user already paid for the same violation76 10 other relevant factors 76editors note amended at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i  23829 lower burrell code  23829  a in order to treat all users fairly and equitably the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will use its best efforts to assess penalties using a consistent methodology thus it will avoid allowing one user to realize an economic benefit from noncompliance which would potentially enable it to gain an economic advantage over the complying users by assessing a penalty based on economic benefit the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will strive to eliminate or remove any financial advantage the violator gains b by exercising a consistent penalty methodology the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington ensure that all violators are treated equitably while the amount of the penalty will vary from case to case the methods used to develop the penalty will be consistent c epa policy followed 1 the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington will take into account the policies of epa in setting penalties epa defines significant noncompliance in its revisions to the general pretreatment regulations 40 cfr 4038f2vii as violations which meet one or more of the following criteria a chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits defined here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken during a sixmonth period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter b technical review criteria trc violations defined here as those in which 33% or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a sixmonth period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit trc   14 for bod tss fats oil and grease and 12 for all other pollutants except ph c any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit daily maximum or longerterm average that the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington determines has caused alone or in combination with other dischargers interferences or pass including endangering the health of potw personnel or the general public d any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the potws exercise of its emergency authority under 40 cfr 4038f1vib to halt or prevent such a discharge  23829 general provisions  23829  e failure to meet within 90 days after the scheduled date a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction completing construction or attaining final compliance f failure to provide within 30 days after the due date required reports such as baseline monitoring reports ninetyday compliance reports periodic selfmonitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules g failure to accurately report noncompliance h any other violation or group of violations which the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program 2 violation of the pretreatment standards and requirements which constitute significant noncompliance are considered to be the most serious violation and require a strong and immediate response assessment of civil penalties may occur for significant noncompliance 3 in addition to assessing appropriate penalties commensurate with the factors listed above the city of lower burrell or the municipal sanitary authority of the city of new kensington shall consider assessing larger penalties in cases of repeat violations including all violations of permit effluent limitations monitoring and reporting requirements and other standard and special discharge conditions this consideration produces flexibility in assessing penalties for multiple violations d criminal penalties any person who knowingly makes any false statements representation or certification in any application record report plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or pretreatment permit or who falsifies tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not more than $1000 plus costs and in default of payment of said fine and costs to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days each occurrence shall be a separate offense this section shall not preclude prosecution under the crimes

stormwater management consists of the planning design and control of the conveyance and storage of surface waters resulting from precipitation major objectives are the protection of water quality the prevention of flooding and erosion and the promotion of the natural recharge of groundwater the pennsylvania stormwater management act86 was enacted in 1978 to address these crucial issues the intent of the act is to encourage stormwater runoff planning and management with the program administered locally consistent with the commonwealths duty as trustee of natural resources and the peoples constitutional right to the preservation of the environment the act places major responsibility for managing stormwater on the landowner or developer  2522 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the city of lower burrell stormwater management   2523 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodcontrol efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpointsource pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams d green infrastructure 1 the use of green infrastructure and lowimpact development

determine how the responsibility for the road should be split one hauler should contact the other hauler and try to mutually agree on sharing responsibility for bonding and repairing of the road if the haulers cannot come to a mutual agreement the posting authority will determine the relative responsibility for each hauler in either case written agreements will then be executed between the
