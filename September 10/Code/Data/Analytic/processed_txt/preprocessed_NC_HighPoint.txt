p2   pounds of tss in hundreds r1 and r2 are determined by a system of user charges and are set forth in a rate schedule adopted by city council 2 the city council in a meeting with the city manager and the director will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the pollution control plants and adjust the surcharge rate to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment 3 the volume of flow used in calculating the amount of surcharge will be based upon the metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city where satisfactory evidence can be produced that more than 10 percent of the total annual volume of water consumed does not return to the public sewer such water may be metered separately subject to the approval of the director and excluded from the surcharge computation d pretreatment program administration charges the schedule of charges and fees adopted by the city may include charges and fees for 1 reimbursement of costs

order to permit an economically viable use of the land or a use that is determined to be required by law the highest use or even an average or generally reasonable expectation is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy the following guidelines shall be used for determining the minimum economically viable use of land and therefore the amount of relief to be granted a landowner in order to reach that minimum 1 a minimum economically viable use of the land should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to the longterm safe occupation of the land if such a subsidy is needed then that should be reflected by lowering the use intensity that is considered a minimum economically viable use on a market valuation basis 2 a use common to the city although it may not involve further development of the land is considered an economically viable use attention shall also be given to land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in the city but which still provide for occupation and living within the city these land uses as well shall be considered economically viable uses 3 the actual condition of the land shall be considered the reality of limited development potential given the natural condition of the land shall not be attributed to the regulations applied to the land if the land is such that it cannot safely accommodate development with normal grading and clearing practices this fact shall lower the intensity of use that is considered a minimum economically viable use 4 the potential for damages to either residents or land shall be assessed in determining economically viable use the need for a governmental subsidy to future landowners shall be considered and the cost of such subsidies shall be deducted from the otherwise established minimum economically viable use 5 expectations shall in general not be considered only reasonable expectations backed by investments as required by the current state of the law shall be considered 6 the current state of law established by the united states supreme court the federal circuit court of appeals and the north carolina supreme court relevant to the granting of relief 18105

landowner and the city an alternative to rezoning the land to a general zoning district where the general zoning district allows certain uses and development that may be appropriate but also allows uses and development that may not conform to adopted policy guidance or would have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands reclassification of land to a conditional zoning district allows a landowner to propose and the city council to consider additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses use standards development intensities development standards and other regulations applicable in the parallel general zoning district this enables the city and the landowner to tailor a zoning classification to accommodate desirable development while avoiding or addressing anticipated problems that may arise from development otherwise allowed by the general zoning district   classification land shall be classified into a conditional zoning district only in

occur utilizing more flexible standards and procedures than would otherwise result from a strict application of general district and development standards planned development districts are intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that will produce a high quality unified project that will not negatively impact adjacent land more specifically the intent of the pd districts is to a promote quality design and reduce or diminish the inflexibility of design that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots  b allow greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access open space and design amenities  c allow greater freedom in providing a wellintegrated mix of residential and nonresidential uses in the same development including a mix of housing types lot sizes and densities  d provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lowering development and housing costs  e enhance pedestrian orientation and make greater accommodations for alternative forms of transportation such as walking bicycling and transit  and f promote environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding established land use character and respects and takes advantage of a sites natural and manmade features such as trees wetlands
