were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of general corp the city of milford has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many american communities while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the city subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the city the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the city council ordered the following codification of the citys legislation contents of various chapters of the all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the city council of the city of milford including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the city council in the course of the codification division of divided into two major divisions the first division includes the charter of the city the second division includes all legislation of a general and permanent nature as parts i and ii administrative legislation contains all city legislation of an administrative nature such as that dealing with the administration of government that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments general legislation contains all other city legislation of a regulatory nature items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions whereas those in do not grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the various items of legislation are organized into chapters their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in in the chapter entitled streets and sidewalks in such chapters use of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation table of contents the table of contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation reserved chapters space has been provided in the the convenient insertion alphabetically of later enactments in the table of contents such space appears as chapters entitled reserved in the body of the reserved space is provided by breaks in the pagenumbering sequence between chapters pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit one hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals  thus begins on page  on page  etc by use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of is 61 while the fourth section of is 534 new sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system thus for example if two sections were to be added between 534 and 535 they would be numbered as 5341 and 5342 note at the end of each you will

be excessive at citys sole discretion starting currents must be limited by the customer to acceptable levels 76a motors general it is characteristic of most electric motors large welding machines and arc furnaces to draw large momentary starting current this may result in objectionable variations in the voltage supply of other customers who receive their service from the same circuits or transformers in the interest of all of citys customers it is therefore necessary for the city to limit the value of starting current which may be drawn by various classes of motors connected to citys lines some latitude in the permissible starting current of motors may be permitted under certain conditions at citys sole discretion such as when motors are started very infrequently once or twice a day when motors are supplied from large capacity circuits and transformers when motors are necessarily supplied from individual transformers on the customers premises etc limitations will be site specific the city must always be consulted in advance regarding motor installation above 5 horsepower single phase or above 10 horsepower three phase to insure the proposed installation is acceptable to city 76b motors residential single phase 120 volt motors will be permitted providing the maximum starting current does not exceed 100 amperes typically 2 hp or 12000 btuhr air conditioner single

phase connected motor load less than 6 horsepower 76d motors industrial due to the wide variety of equipment and methods of service general rules for starting motors cannot be specifically outlined additions to existing installations can be made which will not increase the maximum starting current of the installation in all other cases the city must be consulted as to the maximum allowable starting currents 76e motor protective devices all motors should be provided with devices that will protect the motor and circuit against overload or short circuit in any wire refer to the nec for motor protection details motor equipped with reduced voltage starters that cannot be safely subjected to full voltage at starting should be provided with a device to insure that on the failure of the supply voltage the motor will be disconnected from the line or the starter returned to the off position unless the motor is equipped with automatic restarting means to prevent unnecessary shutdowns it is recommended that this starter be equipped with a time delay feature to prevent the starter from dropping out and to permit the motor to continue to operate during a momentary voltage change the direction of phase rotation and the continuity of all three phases of the alternating current supply are carefully maintained however the city cannot guarantee against accidental or temporary change of failure thereof therefore motors or other apparatus requiring unchanged phase rotation or continuity of threephase supply should be equipped by the customer with suitable threephase protection

519 recommended practices and requirements for harmonic control in electric power systems table 111 the total harmonic distortion thd voltage shall not exceed 5% of the fundamental 60 hz frequency nor 3% of the fundamental for any individual harmonic as measured at the location where the customer interfaces with the citys system point of common coupling in addition the level of harmonic current that the customer is allowed to inject into the citys system shall not exceed that specified in table 103 in ieee std 519 furthermore any commutation notch should be limited as defined by table 102 in ieee std 519 the preceding requirements apply to all types of generation systems 8 the generator owner is responsible for the installation of any necessary controls or hardware to limit the voltage and current harmonics generated by his equipment to defined levels 9 power factor  the generator must not adversely impact the power factor of the generator owner site most inverters are designed to operate close to unity power factor the operating power factor of the generator shall be contained within the limits defined in the table below generating systems with inverters up to 25kw generating systems with inverters greater than 25kw noninverter or rotating machine generating systems 085 lagging or leading when output exceeds 10% of inverter rating from ieee 9291999 085 lagging or leading when output exceeds 10%of inverter rating rating 085 lagging or leading 10 to the extent that a generator owners power factor at the point of common coupling falls below 09 lagging as a direct result of the installation of the generating units the generator owner must obtain install and maintain at his expense corrective apparatus that compensates for the drop in power factor caused by the installation of the generator 11 current  in some cases directional overcurrent protection may be required to limit fault current flowing onto the grid in the event of a line fault dc inverters that are incapable of producing fault current do not require directional overcurrent protection 12 inverter systems should not inject dc current greater than 05% of rated inverter output in the ac interface point under either normal or abnormal conditions 13 fault and line clearing  the generator owner shall automatically disconnect from the citys system during electrical faults on the citys electrical system and upon loss of the citys electric source the generator owner may reconnect when the system voltage and frequency return to normal range and is stabilized as defined in definitions detection of the loss of the citys primary electric system where the generator owner is operating in an island with other customer load becomes increasingly difficult as the level of dispersed generation on a feeder approaches the connected load for generating units 25kw and below the overunder voltage and overunder frequency settings described previously along with the antiislandizing provisions of ieee 929ul 1746 inverters should be sufficient to satisfy this provision for units greater than 25kw the voltage and frequency setpoints are to be adjustable with the actual setting determined by the city based on the electrical characteristics of the generator and the citys electrical system in addition additional protection such as power directional or directional overcurrent functions may be required for units 500kw or larger a direct tripping scheme to trip the generator upon loss of the citys feeder may be required by the city this decision will be based on the saturation of distributed generation on a particular feeder circuit and in those cases where under voltage or under frequency sensing may not adequately detect loss of the city source 14 automatic reclosing  the generator owner is responsible for protecting his equipment from the effects of switching or automatic reclosing of the citys feeder circuit the generator owner may request the city to delay high speed reclosing on the citys feeder to allow the interconnected generator sufficient time to remove itself from an islandized or deenergized feeder prior to automatic reclose since delaying the automatic reclose time degrades the level of service provided to other customers on the circuit the city will limit the automatic reclose time delays to a few seconds or less the generator owner may also request that a direct transfer trip scheme be added to remove the interconnected generator from service prior to automatic reclosing by using communications equipment between the generator site and the city similarly the generation owner may request that a synchronizing check or reclose blocking scheme be installed on the citys feeder to prevent out of phase reclosing the generation owner is responsible for all costs associated with the installation and maintenance of these requested modifications c control protection and safety equipment requirements specific to generators of 25 kw or less 1 all generators 10 kw or less can be single phase customer owned generators greater than 10 kw must be evaluated by the city to determine if it can be single phase the following table
