positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number

is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of 6 9805 article vi  variance procedure   nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1 9805   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the applicant in the office of the kern county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land  and a conformed copy of said recordation shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as indicated in the conditions attached to the variance c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency 2 9805   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the floodplain administrator believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of ae are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the floodplain administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 3 9805 fire prevention code purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public safety and welfare and to prescribe regulations governing conditions hazardous to

to cause deleterious effects to the community in which they are located and to subject such uses to specific regulations with the intent of minimizing to the extent practical these deleterious effects further it is intended that in the zone districts in which these land uses are permitted they are conducted in a manner which is consistent with the protection of the public health safety and welfare in accordance with the goals policies objectives and implementation programs contained in the general plan it is further determined that it is in the interest of public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city to protect minors from viewing publicly displayed harmful matter and that pursuant to penal 1d and e the city is authorized to adopt ordinances which restrict the display of harmful matter to minors by the use of blinder racks it has also been found that there exists an increasing trend toward the display of harmful matter within the meaning of penal at grocery stores convenience stores video stores and other retail outlets as well as from news racks and that restriction of public display of such harmful matter will keep the adverse impacts of such harmful matter upon minors to a minimum  61109   applicability the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the activities and land uses specified by this chapter in addition to any standards and regulations established by this title which may also be applicable to these specified land uses or activities  61109   adult entertainment a applicability it is the intent of this chapter to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts increased crime decreased property values and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors churches and residentially zoned districts or uses the city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area and an increase in the crime and in addition the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere it is therefore the purpose of this title to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses while permitting the location of adult oriented businesses in certain areas b findings of the city council 1 the city council in adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of businesses in other cities american center for law and justice 1996  new york new york 1994  state of new jersey 1994  garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986  indianapolis indiana 1984  houston texas 1983  beaumont texas 1982  minneapolis minnesota 1980  phoenix arizona 1979  whittier california 1978  amarillo texas 1977  cleveland ohio 1977  los angeles california 1977 the city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting this ordinance to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of adult oriented businesses and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that a adultoriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas b both the proximity of adultoriented businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adultoriented businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located c the proximity and concentration of adultoriented businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational and other adultoriented business uses can cause other businesses and residence to move elsewhere d there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by adultoriented businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use prostitution pandering and violence against persons and property the studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adultoriented businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas causing among other adverse secondary effects an increase in crime and a decrease in property values 2 based on the foregoing the city council finds and determines that special regulation of adultoriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that adultoriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks schools churches thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of adultoriented businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects 3 the locational requirements established by this chapter do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected adult oriented businesses that are provided by this chapter 4 in developing the ordinance codified in this chapter the city council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adultoriented businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendments of the united states and california constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adultoriented businesses the city council has considered decisions of the united states supreme court regarding local regulations of adultoriented businesses including but not limited to young v american mini theaters inc 427 u s 50 1976 reh denied 475 u s 1132  fwipbs inc v dallas 493 u s 215 1990  barnes v glenn theater 501 u s 560 1991  united states court of appeals 9th circuit decisions including but not limited to topanga press et al v city of los angeles 989 f 2d 1524 1993  several california cases including but not limited to city of national city v wiener 3 cal4th 832 1993  people v superior court lucero 149 cal3d 14 1989  and city of vallejo v adult books et al 167 cal app 3d 1169 1985  and other federal cases including lakeland lounge v city of jacksonville 5th cir 1992 973 f 2d 1255  hana on inc v arlington 5th cir 1995 65 f 3d 1248  mitchell v commission on adult entertainment 3d cir 1993 10 f 3d 123  international eateries v broward county 11th cir 1991 941 f 2d 1157  and star satellite v city of biloxi 5th cir 1986 779 f 2d 1074 5 the city council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of adult oriented businesses are in the public interest in addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located the city council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of k v inc v kitsay county 793 f 2d 1053 1986 regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution drug dealing and other law enforcement problems 6 the city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decision in the public record a evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult oriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adultoriented businesses on the site of the adult oriented business b evidence has demonstrated that performers employed buy adult oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows c evidence indicates that performers at adult oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment d evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths individual viewing areas and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity e as a result of the above and the increase in incidents of aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility of the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adult oriented businesses 7 zoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the city and to help assure that all operators of adult oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the diverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses 8 the city council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such adult oriented businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses and the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of adult oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases 9 it is not the intent of the city council in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter or any provision thereof to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the city council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city 10 nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize legalize or permit the establishment operation or maintenance of any business building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statue of the state of california regarding public nuisances unlawful or indecent exposure sexual conduct lewdness obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof 11 the city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record a evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult oriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult oriented businesses on the site of the adult oriented business b evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows c evidence indicates that performers at adult oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment 12 in prohibiting public nudity in adult oriented businesses the city council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity 13 the city council also finds as a wholly independent basis that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity 14 while the city council desires to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to adult oriented businesses it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes to the greatest extent feasible those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development operation of adult oriented businesses 15 in enacting a nudity limitation the city declares that the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense the city has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation the city adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an adult oriented business permit issued pursuant to this code 16 the city council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in adult oriented businesses 17 requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales and or transact sexual favors within the adult oriented business 18 enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within adult oriented businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times and that adequate lighting be provided are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and therefore the incidence of illegal conduct within adult oriented businesses and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel c establishment of an adult oriented business as used herein shall mean and include any of the following 1 the opening or commencement of
