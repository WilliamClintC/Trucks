disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare of the community b these flood losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by i the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create
