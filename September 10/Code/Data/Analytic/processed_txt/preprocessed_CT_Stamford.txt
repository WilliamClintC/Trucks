is enacted in response to the serious adverse effects caused certain areas and neighborhoods of the city by motor vehicle congestion particularly the longterm parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof as set forth in more specific detail in  23132 of this article such longterm parking by nonresidents threatens the health safety and welfare of all the residents of the city in order to protect and promote the integrity of these areas and neighborhoods it is necessary to enact parking regulations restricting unlimited parking by nonresidents therein while providing the opportunity for residents to park near their homes uniform parking regulations restricting residents and nonresidents alike would not serve the public interest rather such regulations would contribute to neighborhood decline while ignoring the public transit alternatives to automobile travel available to nonresidents for the reasons set forth in this article a system of preferential resident parking is hereby enacted for the city of stamford findings a general finding the board of representatives finds as a result of public testimony evidence generated by both professional urban planning studies and derived from other sources that the continued vitality of the city of stamford depends on the preservation of safe healthy and attractive neighborhoods and other residential areas therein the board further finds that the flight of residents and property owners from major metropolitan cities can be traced in part to the deterioration of such cities as attractive and comfortable places in which to reside the board further finds that one factor that has contributed to this deterioration in the city is the excessive and burdensome practice of nonresidents of certain areas and neighborhoods parking their motor vehicles for extended periods of time therein since there is in the city at any one time a large surplus of motor vehicles over available onand offstreet public parking spaces this condition detracts from a healthy and complete urban environment a system of preferential resident parking will serve to reduce a number of strains on residents of the city and thus promote the general public welfare b specific findings the following specific legislative findings of the board of representatives in support of preferential resident parking are set forth as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this article they are intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual basis supporting its adoption 1 the safety health and welfare of the residents of the city can be greatly enhanced by maintaining the attractiveness and livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas 2 it is a fact of modern living in the city that a large portion of stamford residents possess automobiles and as a result are daily faced with the need to store these automobiles in or near their residences 3 certain neighborhoods and areas of the city do not have sufficient onor offstreet space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles by residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes 4 such areas as described in 3 above are often further burdened by influxes of motor vehicles owned by nonresidents which compete for the inadequate available onstreet parking spaces 5 there further exist certain parking attractors within the city including but not limited to hospitals office parks parks beaches mass transit stations and terminals and locations convenient for commuter parking which further exacerbate resident parking problems 6 unnecessary vehicle miles noise pollution and strains on interpersonal relationships caused by the conditions set forth herein work unacceptable hardships on residents of these neighborhoods and other residential areas by causing the deterioration of air quality safety tranquility and other values available in an urban residential environment 7 if allowed to continue unchecked these adverse effects on the residents of the city will contribute to a decline of the living conditions therein a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within said city and do frequent injury to the general public welfare 8 a system of preferential resident parking as enacted in this article will serve to promote the safety health and welfare of all the residents of the city by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel noise and pollution and by promoting improvements in air quality the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living and the increased use of public mass transit facilities available now and in the future the public welfare will also be served by ensuring a more stable and valuable property tax base in order

for development serve to preserve significant historic structures and that the loss of said structures would be detrimental to theneighborhood or district 84018  86020   741 below market rate dwelling units a findings it is the public purpose and policy of the city of stamford the southwestern regional planning agency and the state of connecticut to achieve a diverse and balanced community with housing available for households of all income levels economic diversity fosters social and environmental conditions that protect and enhance the social fabric of the city and are beneficial to the health safety and welfare of its residents and to the environmental quality and economy of the region the stamford master plan 2002 has documented a growing affordability gap between the supply of housing and the demand for housing this affordability gap is driven by several broad trends including the fact that home sale prices have grown as fast or faster than household earnings that rents in newer apartment developments are well out of reach of most low and moderate income households and that the limited inventory of affordable marketrate apartments and condos coupled with the inventory of assisted housing units is inadequate to meet the demand for affordable housing a significant cause of this affordability gap and crisis in the availability of a diversity of housing opportunities is the rapid increase in employment in the city employment in stamford increased by 8000 jobs between 1980 and 1990 and is projected to add 9000 more jobs by the year 2000 and an additional 7700 jobs by the year 2010 the master plan establishes the goal of providing decent affordable housing for all of the residents of stamford whatever their economic conditions to address the continuing loss of affordable housing coupled with the increasing affordability gap and growing housing demand the city of stamford has established the goal of producing a minimum of 8000 affordable housing units in addition to what is currently available the master plan recommends as a key element of a coordinated housing strategy that the citys zoning regulations incorporate a mandatory inclusionary housing requirement with appropriate incentives consistent with established planning principles and contextual development the inclusionary housing program defined herein is necessary to provide continuing housing opportunities for low and moderate income households and working people it is necessary to help maintain a diverse housing stock and to allow working people to have better access to jobs and upgrade their economic status the regional trend toward increasing housing prices will without intervention result in inadequate supplies of affordable housing and will negatively impact the ability of local employers to attract and maintain an adequate work force because remaining opportunity for new residential development within the city is limited it is essential that a reasonable proportion

district dwd is a flexible design district subject to special standards and review procedures intended to provide for and encourage the most appropriate use and development of waterfront property giving highest priority and preference to water dependent uses on sites that are physically suited for such uses and for which there is a reasonable demand consistent with the policies of the connecticut coastal area management act application of the designed waterfront development district is intended to promote the following objectives a protection and encouragement of existing and new waterdependent uses and their essential supporting uses  b conservation of significant resources  c promotion of those uses which maximize the opportunity for public access to and enjoyment of waterfront areas without conflicting with viable existing waterdependent uses or sites highly suitable for other waterdependent uses  d encouragement of harbor revitalization measures that emphasize the waterfront as a public pedestrian district connecting the shorefront with the adjacent neighborhoods and the central business district  e protection of key public vistas and development of visual access to coastal landscapes  f provide for new uses which are compatible with the seasonal cycle of waterbased activities and those environmental hazards unique to the coastal area  g promotion of architecture and site development of design merit that makes best use of natural features that harmonizes with the pattern and scale of the coastline and that remains compatible with the surrounding architecture and pattern of development and that preserves significant structures and features representing the historic pattern and scale of stamfords waterfront heritage  h control of the type and intensity of development to insure a positive impact on adjacent neighborhoods and the central business district to encourage the retention of employment opportunity associated with waterdependent uses and to prevent adverse impact on municipal services and infrastructure capacities and capabilities 2 criteria for designation of a designed waterfront development district in order to qualify for
