effective  chapters 202 208 210 and 212 were renumbered amended repealed and recreated and adopted  effective  the general scheme was to include those officers officials and employees in separate ordinances where a common factor applied to each of them the common factor may be the appointing authority or state statutes or that the official city table of organization hereafter to required creation of the ordinance each ordinance is quite similar but each has differences several ordinances that pertained to individual offices and purported to be job descriptions were repealed for most of their provisions were found in state law other ordinances or the general employment policies of the city past experience indicates the personnel policies established by these ordinances and the table of organization will need constant review frequent changes in federal and state laws will require some amendments other amendments will arise as the scope of various offices and positions expands or contracts to meet changing needs of the citizens the council and the municipal corporation amendments may only be made by action of the common council therefore all city officers officials

oddshaped lots and culdesac lots are adjusted to an average frontage equivalent to the frontage of a rectangularly shaped lot of the same depth this method is declared and found to be a more equitable assessment method than the simple front footage method the adjusted front footage method gives consideration to the depth and shape as well as frontage on the street improved the plat example following illustrates how the method is used in practice lot a corner lotassessable footage shall be based on the frontage of the short side see lot b 80 feet by 120 feet adjusted front footage 8000 feet lot c 60 feet by 120 feet adjusted front footage 6000 feet lot d 60 feet by 120 feet adjusted front footage 6000 feet lot e 6600 square feet 120 feet adjusted front footage 5500 feet lot f 5400 square feet 120 feet adjusted front footage 4500 feet lot g 4600 square feet 120 feet adjusted front footage 3833 feet lot h 8000 square feet 120 feet adjusted front footage 6666 feet square footage amounts for h are estimates  note that the assessable footage is further modified under a b in the adjusted front footage formula in subsection a the lot depth figure of 120 feet has been used in the calculations the figure of 100 feet is the average depth of lots in the city however in applying this formula to a specific block the actual denominator used in the formula shall be the apparent general lot depth of the block in which the lot is situated or 120 feet whichever is less such apparent lot depth shall be determined by the capital improvements and street maintenance committee and included in the schedule of the proposed assessments required by wis stats   subject to the usual control of the common council set forth in the cited section of the statutes   part 1992  part 1986   applying the adjusted front footage formula one hundred twenty feet will be used throughout this section as the denominator for purposes of explaining the application of the formula a oddshaped lots for oddshaped lots such as found on culdesacs or triangular intersections etc the adjusted front footage is computed by dividing the area of the lot up to a maximum distance of 120 feet from the street where the improvement is to be installed by 120 feet when the adjusted front foot formula is applied and results in an adjusted frontage which is greater than the actual frontage then the assessable footage shall be the greater of the following 1 if the adjusted lot frontage is greater than the actual frontage then the assessable footage shall be equal to the adjusted lot frontage but shall not exceed 15 times the actual lot frontage 2 if the adjusted lot frontage is less than the average lot frontage as determined by the board of public works then the assessable footage shall equal the average lot frontage b approximately rectangular lots for a lot which is approximately rectangular the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and back sides of the lot if the lot is deeper than 120 feet the width at the 120foot depth is used for the back lot line this method is limited to where the divergence between the front and rear lot lines is five feet or less c rectangular lots for the normal rectangular lot the adjusted front footage is the actual front footage of the lot using the 120foot denominator d shallow lots for rectangular lots under 120 feet in depth the adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 120 feet e neck lots for lots which have a small frontage on a street with a narrow strip running back 120 feet more or less an adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 120 feet f corner lots corner lot assessments shall be based on the adjusted frontage of the short side if the short side is the first side improved the assessable footage shall equal the adjusted frontage of the short side if improvements are made to both the long and short side at the same time the assessable footage shall equal the adjusted frontage of the short side plus the excess adjusted frontage of the long side as determined in section f1 and 2 if the long side is the first side improved there shall be an assessment levied for only the excess adjusted frontage on the long side as determined in section f1 and 2 if prior assessments on the long side were levied under a previous assessment ordinance and if those prior improvements have exceeded their design life then the proposed improvements for the short side shall be assessed at the full amount under this ordinance however all corner lot assessments may be otherwise separately determined by the board of public works which may levy special assessments or make such deductions as deemed reasonable and equitable for the specific improvement project as authorized by wis stats  3 as one common example of discretionary action if improvements such as sidewalk curb and pavement or utilities are not likely to be installed on the short side frontage within a reasonable planning period then the board of public works may determine it is in the public interest to assess the corner lot at the time of the initial improvements even if the improvements are adjacent to the long side frontage of the property in such a case assessments shall be determined based on the short side frontage plus any excess adjusted frontage on the long side and no additional assessment shall be levied when improvements are installed on the short side except for any previously unassessed excess adjusted frontage in those areas where the property lines meet with an arc rather than at a point the frontage shall be computed as onehalf the arc measurement plus the measurement of the short side 1 maximum corner lot adjustment for large residential lots large residential lots shall have a maximum corner lot assessment adjustment based on a 100foot by 150foot adjustment parcel splitout of the total lot assessments shall be levied on both sides of the large lot for frontage in excess of the 100foot by 150foot adjustment parcel but only when improvements are made to each side when the short side is improved the assessable footage shall be based on the sum of the frontage of the short side of the splitout adjustment parcel 100 feet plus any additional total lot frontage in excess of that 100 feet eg assessable footage 100 feet + 30 feet   130 feet when the long side is improved the assessable footage shall be based on the total lot frontage in excess of the long side of the splitout adjustment parcel 150 feet no assessment shall be levied against the long side of the splitout adjustment parcel eg assessable footage   25 feet 2 maximum corner lot adjustment for large business commercial or industrial lots large business commercial or industrial corner lots shall have a maximum corner lot assessment adjustment based on a 60foot by 120foot adjustment parcel splitout of the total lot assessments shall be levied on both sides of the large lot for frontage in excess of the 60foot by 120foot adjustment parcel  but only when improvements are made to each side when the short side is improved the assessable footage shall be based on the sum of the frontage of the short side of the splitout adjustment parcel 60 feet plus any additional total lot frontage in excess of that 60 feet eg assessable footage   60 feet + 30 feet   90 feet when the long side is improved the assessable footage shall be based on the total lot frontage in excess of the long side of the splitout adjustment parcel 120 feet no assessment shall be levied against the long side of the splitout adjustment parcel eg assessable footage   40 feet g double frontage lots see lot b in the chart a double frontage lot assessment is an exception to the rule its assessment shall be for the first side served the assessment shall be computed on the adjusted front foot method that conforms to the shape and size of the lot except that if the lot is capable of division on a line roughly parallel to either of the abutting streets into two or more lots upon which two or more principal buildings could be erected according to the regulations of the zoning district in which the lot is located the assessment shall then be for both sides when served and at the adjusted front foot formula as conforms to the size and shape of the resulting lots any variance

to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the common council c the common council hereby designates the stormwater management administrator or appointee to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance d the requirements of this ordinance do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following 1 wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats  28116 and 28333 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under of the wisconsin administrative findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources uncontrolled runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other minor drainage facilities f threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes g undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding   purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property b intent it is the intent of the common council that this ordinance regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state and construction site erosion control this ordinance may be applied on a sitebysite basis the common council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this ordinance is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats  28116 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community   applicability and jurisdiction a applicability 1 where not otherwise limited by law this ordinance applies to land disturbing construction activity meeting any of the criteria in this paragraph unless the site is otherwise exempt under paragraph 2 a a postconstruction site that had one or more acres of land disturbing construction activity 2 a site that meets any

disturbance if performed to maintain the original line and grade hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility f underground utility construction such as water sewer and fiber optic lines this exemption does not apply to the construction of any above ground structures associated with utility construction 3 notwithstanding the applicability requirements in paragraph a this ordinance applies to postconstruction sites of any size that in the opinion of the stormwater management administrator is likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water that causes undue channel erosion that increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or public

measuring approximately one mile square the united states government also provided the sections would exist as they were monumented by the original surveyors due to the surveying methods employed and available equipment difficult terrain and the configuration of the planet earth all sections were not surveyed to the desired degree of accuracy many sections of land are short or long in measurement by example it is impossible for all 40 parcels within a section of land 640 acres to contain 40 acres each have 90degree angles and measure 1320 feet square numerous metes and bounds descriptions appear in deeds assuming such measurements were correct these boundary discrepancies have caused many disputes many land owners believe their respective land parcel has been surveyed because it is shown in the city assessor or county treasurers plat book  however only those land parcels which have been surveyed and recorded as a subdivision plat or certified survey map and filed in the register of deeds office constitute a record survey although a substantial percentage of the city is presently supported by record surveys and monumentation there are areas where accurate location of property boundaries is difficult if not impossible some land parcels in the city exist only by metes and bounds land description in the past some land parcels were surveyed within the city but not recorded as a plat or certified survey map many land owners later cannot remember who the surveyor was and cannot recall if they were given a map of the survey also many land owners have staked their own property without the benefit of a recorded survey and have caused confusion as a result every land parcel within the city should be described and located by a recorded survey map or plat it is essential the parcel be located as described by deed and that buildings and structures if any are constructed within the parcel boundaries part 200 file no 020413   benefits an assessors plat survey benefits the property owner by clarifying boundaries title determinations are made definite financing is more easily obtained transfer of title is readily accomplished taxation and special assessments are equitably ascertained the primary advantage to the owner is the confidence his property is accurately located and described free of any discrepancies which may have existed by reason of a deed description not supported by a survey map or plat of record the distinct advantages of an assessors plat over other types of surveyed plats or maps are all property boundary discrepancies are reconciled in entirety within the area covered by the plat  no future problems concerning property boundaries are likely an assessors plat survey provides mutual benefits to the individual property owner and the city the city initiates an assessors plat survey based upon the recommendations of the director of public works or city engineer and the city assessor where an assessors plat survey is made the cost attributable to each parcel therein for such survey is substantially less than the cost of surveying each parcel separately it is reasonable the city share in the cost of the assessors

certain additional requirements are superimposed on the underlying standard zoning districts set forth above in this title each overlay district is intended to address a special land use circumstance beyond those addressed by the underlying zoning district special requirements include protections against natural hazards protections of valued natural and cultural resources and guidelines for unique development situations any nonconforming situation lot use structure andor site shall adhere to the provisions of article v 2 how to use sections  to  a a given property may lie within one or more overlay zoning district based on its geographic location the provisions of this article are intended to be consulted before issuance of any building permit site plan approval conditional use permit zoning permit zoning change or land division to ensure the intended use meets all of the requirements of any applicable overlay district in addition to the underlying standard zoning district for each overlay district established in this article a definition of the resource or geographic area is provided followed by the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing the resource or geographic location the method of delineating the boundaries of the overlay district and the development regulations 3 for the purpose of this title the following overlay zoning districts are hereby established a pud planned unit development overlay zoning district b sw shorelandwetland overlay district c f floodplain overlay district d w well head protection overlay district e re river edge overlay district f wd woodland overlay district 4 map of overlay zoning districts a except where otherwise indicated in this article the overlay zoning districts are represented on the official zoning map adopted and from time to time amended by the city of wausau   planned unit development overlay zoning district 1 purpose the purpose of this overlay district is to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district in exchange for such flexibility it is anticipated that development within a planned unit development overlay district will reflect the citys planning policies as set forth in the citys comprehensive plan and offer one or more of the following advantages a positively contribute to the appearance and function of land uses and site design in the area b promote a greater level of architectural quality and be compatible with other structures in the area c conserve and protect environmentally sensitive areas areas of natural beauty and natural green spaces d preserve the cultural and historic character and significance of existing structures or areas e provide substantial buffers and transitions between incompatible land uses and densities f reduce congestion on streets and improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation g development would not conflict with or cause overload on such facilities as schools highways police fire or utility services h insure proper maintenance and preservation of any common areas for recreation and esthetic enhancement 2 intent planned unit developments are intended to encourage promote and provide improved environmental design by allowing for greater freedom imagination and flexibility in the development of land while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of this title and the city of wausau comprehensive plan to this end planned unit developments allow diversification and variation in the relationship of uses structures open spaces and heights of structures in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects the planned unit development overlay district shall allow development to be designed reviewed approved constructed and managed as approved by the common council rather than required by the underlying zoning district a the city may permit flexibility in the types of uses area and yard requirements offstreet parking andor other regulations set forth in this title by use of exceptionsbase standard modifications subject to the demonstration of their appropriateness for the area under consideration b it is not intended that the city will automatically grant exceptionsbase standard modifications in a planned unit development overlay district and it is expected the city will grant only such exceptions when they are consistent and comparable with benefits to the community that result from the planned unit development c the city may require as conditions of approval any reasonable stipulation limitation or design factor which will promote suitable development in the planned unit development overlay district d a public hearing process is required to review a request for a planned unit development this process will essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment for the general development plan gdp step with that required for a conditional use for the specific implementation plan sip step with several additional requirements see section  for the general development plan and specific implementation plan requirements 3 provision of flexible development standards for planned unit developments a permitted location 1 planned unit developments shall be permitted with the approval of a planned unit development overlay

but are not limited to a transitional locations that involve a mix of different land uses where new development is proposed in a location of preexisting uses and buildings b infill locations in a developed area that involve parcels that may have been bypassed during the normal course of urbanization or that have been cleared c redevelopment locations where first or subsequent uses andor structures are to be replaced by new uses andor structures d development locations where base zoning standards may not be appropriate andor needed and where the developer and community will benefit from a greater level of flexibility in land use and bulk controls 5 reference for requirements see section  for the general development plan and specific implementation plan requirements 6 exempt

certain land use activities whether intentional or accidental can seriously impair groundwater quality the purpose of the well head protection overlay district wh is to help protect municipal well groundwater resources from contamination by certain land use activities this is accomplished by imposing certain land use restrictions upon the area located within the approximate groundwater recharge area of the city municipal wells the restrictions imposed upon the property within this overlay district are in addition to the regulations governing the underlying residential commercial industrial or other zoning districts or any other provisions of the zoning ordinance 2 general provisions a the regulations established by this overlay district are intended to either prohibit certain land uses that might otherwise be permitted in the underlying zoning districts or to allow certain activities as a conditional use that might otherwise be permitted in the underlying zoning district b the uses prohibited in the well head protection overlay district are activities that as a result of normal operations or accidents may impair groundwater quality these prohibitions are intended to provide a reasonably high degree of assurance that within the municipal well recharge area discharges of contaminants into the groundwater supply will be minimized these preventive measures are important since groundwater cleanup is often prohibitively expensive and liability for such cleanup is often hard or impossible to establish c the uses prohibited within a well head protection overlay district are prohibited based upon the pollution experience of the individual uses the operational methods and technology generally employed by that type of use or the materials or products commonly handled by these uses as the technology of identified uses changes to nonrisk materials or operational methods the list of prohibited land uses may be amended to reflect these changes 3 establishment of

development site b bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site where appropriately designed and sited a bioswale is a linear vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities the flow of water being conveyed bioswale is slowed down allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding

application of the owners of the subject property or authorized agent of the owners of the subject property b a recommendation of the plan commission to the common council c by action of the common council d by request of the zoning administrator 3 application a zoning interpretation application contains all of the following a clear indication of the text of this title for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text b if the requested interpretation relates to the application of this title to a specific property the additional following information may be required digital files should be submitted whenever possible 1 a map of the subject property depicting a all lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 100 feet of the boundaries of the subject property b current zoning of the subject property and its environs and the jurisdictions which maintains that control c all lot dimensions of the subject property d a graphic scale and a north arrow 2 a written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities buildings and structures currently located on and proposed for the subject property 3 a site plan of the subject property as proposed for development said site plan shall conform to the requirements of section  c if the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this title a series of written responses to the following questions 1 how is the subject land use in general harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the citys comprehensive plan this title and any other plan program or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city 2 how is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought 4 review by zoning administrator a the zoning administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the requirements of this title if the application is determined to be incomplete the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant b the zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed interpretation provided in the application to determine whether the requested variance is in harmony with the citys comprehensive plan c the zoning administrator shall forward a report to the applicant indicating the interpretation of the zoning administrator if the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the comprehensive plan the zoning administrator shall note this determination in the report 5 standards for review this title shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the common council as noted in this title and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title is to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party ie the abutting landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title any interpretation which will result in any reduction of a normally required bufferyard or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements d this title has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of abutting property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this title should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council e in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by subsections 5a d above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters 1 no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation 2 no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted or conditional in the zoning district of the subject property see article ii 3 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see article ii 4 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see article ii 5 if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to section  6 effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this title these permits and approvals include but are not limited to required site plans special use permits conditional uses and certificates of occupancy 7 limitations on favorable land use interpretation a no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation unless a building permit is issued and development has begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period b an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued the interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued a favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall for any reason be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more   variances 1 purpose the purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and decide requests for permitted variation from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public interest  where owing to special factors a literal enforcement of the provisions
