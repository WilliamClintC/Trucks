cost eg under professional consulting and architectural engineering services contracts a cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking and for sole source procurements

reserved article ii  adult entertainment footnotes  2  editors note  adopted  amended art ii in its entirety with the exception of  1031 to read as herein set out former art ii  10321054 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted  state law reference nudity and related acts on premises ocga  3341  employee solicitation of patrons for drinks on premises ocga  3342 purpose based on city officials own observations of establishments that exploit live human nudity and human sexuality for commercial profit euphemistically referred to as adult entertainment and the experiences of other urban cities and counties including but not limited to austin texas  manatee county florida  the state of minnesota  indianapolis indiana  oklahoma city oklahoma  and phoenix arizona and as further described in city of erie v paps am 529 us 277 120 s ct 1382 2000 which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city of jonesboro georgia and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the mayor and council the mayor and council take note of the wellknown and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country moreover it is the finding of the mayor and council that the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality in all the forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has deleterious effects on the community where it takes place and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when adult entertainment is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol the mayor and council find that adult entertainment causes an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas including but not limited to disorderly conduct public intoxication prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use and corruption of public officials the mayor and council further find that adult entertainment establishments escalate undesirable community conditions including blight diminish property values increase the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources and increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described the mayor and council expressly find that the negative effects of adult entertainment are not limited to adult entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts other forms of adult entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general such other forms of adult entertainment include but are not limited to adult bookstores peep shows adult theaters massage parlors bath houses adult gift or novelty shops and lingerie modeling studios further based on the investigation conducted by the city regarding lingerie modeling studios it is the finding of the mayor and council that lingerie modeling studios are establishments that offer adult entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting based on the evidence presented to the mayor and council it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios by providing adult entertainment in a private setting lead to criminal behavior including but not limited to masturbation for hire prostitution and sodomy furthermore based on the investigation conducted by the city it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to adult entertainment business in that the activity occurs within a private setting as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all patrons of the establishment for the same reason the mayor and council have identified massage parlors as presenting similar risks of criminal behavior and problems of enforcement the mayor and council have determined that lighting visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to patrons and others accordingly the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health welfare safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate adult entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the city so as to limit the adverse impact on property values other business uses residential uses and public and semipublic uses  to ensure that adult entertainment uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts  to restrict adult entertainment and adult uses in heavilyused public pedestrian areas and to protect patrons of adult entertainment business from unreasonable risk of crime after giving due consideration to the considerations stated in these findings and the current state of growth and development of the city the mayor and council find that properties located within the city limits and abutting the right of way of tara boulevard are so situated as to provide sufficient vehicular access to patrons and suppliers while providing the desired containment from residential uses and pedestrian traffic regarding adult entertainment facilities and adult entertainment businesses this article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legallyprotected forms of expression this article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of providers and patrons of adult entertainment it is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that commercially exploit human sexuality entertainment to limit adult entertainment uses of property

that 1 land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  2 land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  3 the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  4 these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  5 localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution  and 6 therefore the city of jonesboro has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff b purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as

jonesboro city council makes the following findings 1 stormwater management is needed throughout the city of jonesboro while specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city of jonesboro is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 2 addressing the stormwater management needs in the city of jonesboro is essential to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city of jonesboro in a variety of ways 3 failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding streambank and ditch erosion property damage and degradation of water quality aquatic habitat and biological communities failure to manage these impacts can put the city of jonesboros ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk 4 the volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property therefore the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees 5 clayton county forest park jonesboro lake city lovejoy morrow and riverdale presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years the future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems in the city of jonesboro in concert with the management of other water resources in the county in order to do so there must be adequate and stable funding for the city of jonesboros stormwater management programs operating needs and capital 6 the feasibility report submitted to the county cities and clayton county water authority ccwa properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility 7 as a result the countys governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly

subdivisions a purpose minor subdivisions provide certain advantages to the applicant such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications given these advantages the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive andor contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision it is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of such chain subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels which collectively total more than three lots it is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit adjacent minor subdivisions within a threeyear time period in

b common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats contiguous common parcels as defined by these regulations shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision

filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of these regulations if property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership  however this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a threeyear period it is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years regardless of ownership res no 200510  1218

thoroughfare plan commonlyaccepted standards this information standards and design criteria commonly used by other jurisdictions design guidelines for street classifications this standards and design criteria used by the north carolina department of transportation jonesboro thoroughfare plan this the application of those standards and design criteria to the jonesboro context and comprises the proposed thoroughfare plan standards and criteria background the approach characterizing the jonesboro thoroughfare plan stems from new urbanism and traditional neighborhood development models the approach is also to keep it simple and accordingly the name of the plan is proposed as the jonesboro thoroughfare plan postwar development model the following excerpt conveys the roots of these development models that spell a return to a traditional development model that preceded widespread automobile ownership and suburbanization of america prior to wwii the traditional neighborhood street was in the range of 28 feet30 feet wide with corner radius of 5 feet10 feet since that time the typical local street has grown to a width of 36 feet with a corner radius of 25 feet the wider street was intended to move traffic more quickly and efficiently it has unfortunately faster traffic and increased amounts of asphalt have diminished the quality of our neighborhoods through the first quarter of this century the united states was developed in the form of compact mixeduse neighborhoods the pattern began to change with the emergence of modern architecture and zoning and ascension of the automobile after world war ii a new system of development was implemented nationwide replacing neighborhoods with a rigorous separation of uses that has become known as conventional suburban development or sprawl the majority of us citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last 50 years principles of new urbanism the strength of new urbanism lies in the design of neighborhoods this is guided by principles developed by town planners andres duany and elizabeth platerzyberk according to these planners an authentic neighborhood contains most of the following elements a the neighborhood has a discernible center this is often a square of a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner a transit stop would be located at this center b most of the dwellings are within a fiveminute walk of the center an average of roughly 2000 feet c there is a variety of dwelling types  usually detached dwellings townhouses and apartments  so that younger and older people singles and families the poor and the wealthy may find places to live d there are shops and offices at the edge of the neighborhood of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household e a small ancillary building is permitted within the backyard of each house it may be used as a rental unit or place to work eg office or craft workshop f an elementary school is near enough so that most children may walk from their home g there are small playgrounds near every dwelling  not more than a tenth of a mile away h streets within the neighborhood are a connected network that disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination i the streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees this slows traffic creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles j buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street creating a welldefined outdoor space k parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street parking is relegated to the rear of buildings usually accessed by alleys l certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings these provide sites for community meetings education religion or cultural activities commonlyaccepted standards a number of state highway departments have developed standards that advance tnd objectives these standards are consistent with jonesboros historic development pattern and are presented here for application to the proposed jonesboro thoroughfare plan street construction design guidelines design speed maximum design speeds should consider the street type vehicle use and the proposed speed limit as most streets are lanes and streets which provide direct access to neighborhoods the maximum desired vehicle speed is approximately 20 mph street types and widths specific dimensions of each street element are provided in the table below  dimensions are from curb face to curb face street types and proposed widths street type lane parking bicycle gutter median gutter lane 8 feet 8 feet na 1 foot na street 9 feet 6 feet na 2 feet na avenue 11 feet 6 feet 6 feet 2 feet 1 foot main street 11 feet 6 feet 6 feet 2 feet 1 foot boulevard 11 feet 6 feet 6 feet 2 feet 1 foot parkway 12 feet na na 2 feet 1 foot note bicycle lanes are optional when alternate routes to the same destination are provided many of the standards advocated in this reference are designed to accommodate the most frequent and numerous users of tnd street networks that is motorists cyclists and pedestrians use by oversized vehicles such as delivery trucks moving vans school buses and fire trucks is generally infrequent particularly on residential streets and lanes a basic premise of tndresponsive design is that a street should be no wider than the minimum width needed to accommodate the usual vehicular mix desired for that street on a properly designed tnd street the occasional oversized vehicle may cross the centerline of a street when making a right turn stopping sight distances minimum stopping distances are referenced to design speed according to the tnd standards advanced sight distances should be accommodated for both vertical and horizontal alignments stopping distances must be increased for downhill grades distances under wet pavement conditions are as follows design speed minimum stopping distance 20 mph 125 feet 25 mph 150 feet 30 mph 200 feet vertical curve design k values for vertical curve design should be consistent with design speeds the maximum centerline grades should also be consistent with design standards centerline radii the criteria for minimum centerline radius for design speeds of 25 mph or less no super elevation are design speed minimum centerline radius 20 mph 90 feet 25 mph 175 feet curb radii a minimum curb radius of 15 feet is recommended for design speeds of 20 mph certain intersections on avenues main streets and boulevards may require a curb radius of as much as 25 feet in instances of larger curb radii sidewalks may be set back six to 10 feet from curbs in addition onstreet parking may be prohibited within 30 feet of the intersection on each street intersection sight triangles the minimum sight triangle for stop conditions at street intersections shall be 70 feet along the major road rightofway and 20 feet along the minor road rightofway the intersection sight triangle shall be permanent rightofway these dimensions may be reduced for lower design speeds on lanes and streets curb construction all curbed streets shall be built in accordance with gdot requirements for vertical curb and gutter construction gutters for lanes are to be two feet wide  street median gutters are to be one foot pavement design alleys shall conform to city of jonesboro standards as to pavement section for local streets all other roads shall meet the pavement design criteria established in the city of jonesboro development  sidewalks minimum sidewalk width is five feet for neighborhoods and eight feet for commercial districts sidewalks shall also meet or exceed the guidelines of the americans with disabilities act cyclists on lower volume streets cyclists should be considered a normal part of the vehicle traffic on the street on higher volume streets cyclists should be accommodated with sixfoot wide bike lanes  separate bikeways may be considered routing for cyclists may include signs and striping including changing the color of the bike lane as appropriate transit road design should be compatible with transit transit should be addressed wherever it is present and should be appropriately planned for developing areas onstreet parking parking on lanes and local streets is not designated or marked onstreet parking along major streets should be signed marked or otherwise clearly designated curb cuts curb cuts or driveways should be minimized to reduce impacts to onstreet parking conflicts with pedestrians and cyclists and interruptions in traffic flow planting strips and street trees planting strips located between the curb and sidewalk parallel with the street shall be six feet or more in width small street trees may be planted within three feet of the back of curb and should generally be planted along the centerline of the planting strip along streets with design speeds of 20 mph or less or along streets with onstreet parking in commercial areas with high pedestrian volumes granted tree wells may be used in lieu of planting strips trees and other objects should be restricted from corners for distances of 30 feet on all sides to maintain sight lines along all planting strips the area between two feet and seven feet above ground shall be maintained as a clear zone to preserve sight lines and accommodate pedestrians utilities all utility installations within rightsofway shall be consistent with the city of jonesboro development regulations underground utilities may cross under or run longitudinally under the pavement in residential subdivision streets provided future utility stubouts are installed prior to paving underground utilities may cross under all other streets and roadways but may not run longitudinally under the pavement except in unusual situations approved by the city engineer lighting shorter light standards located on a reduced spacing are preferable to fewer taller highintensity light standards the scale of lighting fixtures and the illumination provided must be appropriate for both pedestrian and vehicular movement design guidelines by street classification alleys alleys provide access to residential and commercial properties but are not designed to handle alleys are found primarily in singlefamily residential developments and serve as rear access to garages business owners sometime use alleys for locating dumpsters utilities are often provided in alleys to connect to the rear of homes or businesses a minimum rightofway of 20 feet is required with a minimum pavement width of 12 feet lanes lanes provide access to singlefamily dwellings and are generally two to six blocks in length a street width of 18 feet is typical with storm drainage addressed by curb and gutter onstreet parking is permitted though usually limited to guests planting strips six feet in width parallel fivefoot sidewalks that are located on both frontages the design speed for lanes is 20 miles per hour mph and a 40foot rightofway is required streets streets provide access to many forms of housing and are generally two to six blocks in length streets are 28 feet wide with curb and gutter and onstreet parking planting strips six feet in width and fivefoot sidewalks on both sides of each frontage are typical design speed for streets is 20 mph and a 50foot right of way is required avenues avenues convey vehicular traffic over short distances at moderate speeds these routes serve as connectors between neighborhoods and mixeduse and commercial centers avenues often lie along an important axis terminating at prominent buildings or plazas avenues may also provide circulation around squares or neighborhood parks recommended street width is 26 feet on both sides of an 18foot median this configuration accommodates one 12foot travel lane a sixfoot bike lane and an eightfoot parallel parking space a minimum rightofway of 98 feet and a maximum of two travel lanes are recommended planting strips with a width of six feet and eightfoot sidewalks are also recommended on each side design speed for avenues is 30 mph main streets main streets provide lowspeed access to neighborhoods and highdensity residential and commercial districts a 66foot rightofway is required to accommodate sidewalks curb and gutter and onstreet parking which is to be striped travel lanes on main streets are 11 feet and limited to two travel lanes bike lanes are optional but if provided a minimum width of six feet is recommended sidewalks having a minimum width of eight feet and installed on each side of the rightofway are also recommended planting wells using sixfoot tree grates are recommended rather than medians bike lanes are optional features unique to main streets are bulbouts at intersections and midblock crossings  both of which are intended to enhance pedestrian use and safety posted speeds should not exceed 25 mph parkways parkways are designed to serve motorists at the edge of towns or in agricultural areas they are used for travel into town or for travel areas parkways are not designed for developed areas as when the parkway enters town these routes transition to a boulevard parkways require a minimum rightofway of 118 feet travel lanes are typically 1112 feet and a typical section uses a shoulder with ditches to accommodate runoff parkways can accommodate abundant pedestrian amenities  landscaped medians up to 30 feet wide multiuse trails ranging from 1014 feet in width planting strips of 720 feet and bikeways separated from travel lanes are not uncommon storm water runoff can be addressed using swales or curb and gutter the multiuse trails may be established on either or both sides of a parkway a paved shoulder having a minimum width of six feet should be provided on highspeed parkways that is those with posted speeds greater than 45 mph maximum design speed for parkways is 50 mph jonesboro thoroughfare plan standards and design criteria adopted by other jurisdictions can provide an appropriate frame of reference in considering local plans however this information must be tailored to the jonesboro context the following standards and design criteria are proposed the jonesboro thoroughfare plan establishes a street hierarchy comprised of primary arterial major collector and local street these are organized in order of size with the interstate conveying the highest traffic volumes and the highest speeds  local streets carry the lowest volumes and are characterized by the lowest speeds each street classification in the hierarchy is described below  primary arterial  major collector  local street primary arterials arterials are designed to provide a high degree of mobility and serve longer vehicle trips to from and within urban areas arterials form the skeleton of the roadway network linking urban centers such as the central business district industrial parks commercial centers major residential developments and other key activity centers primary arterials are designed to carry between 45000 and 75000 trips per day the city of jonesboro has only one primary arterial and that is tara boulevard highway 1941 major collector streets collector streets link neighborhoods to commercial districts and commuter traffic to secondary arterials these streets are well traveled and are built to an urban standard collector streets are typically two to fourlane facilities with an average daily traffic count between 7500 and 15000 vehicles the following streets comprise jonesboros major collector streets fayetteville road north avenue north main street south main street mcdonough street smith street stockbridge roadhighway 138 jodeco road local streets local streets serve neighborhoods and are generally arranged in a grid pattern although development out from jonesboros historic core tends to be served by curvilinear street patterns these roads accommodate access to collector streets and local destinations at low speeds  sidewalks encourage pedestrian travel and community livability standards and design criteria pertaining to local streets are as follows  local streets shall be limited to a twolane section with a two foot curb and gutter on each frontage  pavement sections shall be comprised of two 12foot lanes with parking permitted  stormwater runoff shall be addressed using drainage sales  fivefoot sidewalks shall be established on each frontage as well as landscaped strips having a minimum dimension of four feet shade trees shall be planted on 50foot centers  rightofway required for a local street shall be a minimum of 50 feet  all local streets in the town center shall have sidewalks
