property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated

statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development

are areas designated as floodway a floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters debris or erosion potential in addition the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights therefore the following provisions shall apply a the community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one 1 foot at any point b encroachments are prohibited including fill new construction substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway development may be permitted however provided it is demonstrated hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge a registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof c a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations provided that the community first applies for a conditional firm and floodway revision fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of  6512 and receives the approval of the building official d require until a regulatory floodway is designated that no new construction substantial improvements or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae on the communitys firm unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one 1 foot at any point within the community e only if subsections 4364b c or d

the city requires that 1 development impacts from new developments are mitigated of street rightsofway andor improvements to existing and new roadways  and 2 adequate infrastructure for new development is adequately evaluated and addressed b there must be a rough proportionality between the traffic impacts created by a new development and the requirements placed on the property owner or applicant for a new development to dedicate and improve offsite and abutting city streets the city will evaluate the project and determine what dedications if any are required to address both the nature and the extent of the impact that results from the proposed development the city desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated of transportation system improvements it is the citys intent to institute a procedure to assure that mandatory street construction requirements are proportional to the traffic demands created by the new development  applicability a the regulations

with these standards however applicability shall not include singlefamily residential or multifamily developments which consist of thirtyfive 35 or fewer dwellings b the city engineer may require the developer of any residential multifamily commercial or industrial development within the city limits and its jurisdictional area to conduct a traffic impact study tis if there is a reasonable expectation that the development may cause one 1 or more of the following conditions 1 produce trip generations during the peak hour in excess of seventyfive 75 vehicles per hour  2 a change in land

hour in excess of seventyfive 75 vehicles per hour  4 an additional access by an existing facility to a city of foley roadway that the city does not consider to be necessary for safe and efficient

approvals from aldot  5 assist in securing financial participation for major thoroughfare improvements from baldwin county aldot or other area wide transportation planning and management entities as may be established in the future  city evaluation and actions a the city shall evaluate the adequacy of the traffic impact study tis prepared by the applicant based upon such evaluation the city shall determine 1 whether the applicant may be approved in the absence of dedication of rightsofway or construction of improvements to each affected thoroughfare  and 2 the extent of the applicants obligations to make such dedications or improvements b the application for which a tis is being conducted shall not be approved until the city is satisfied with the financial arrangements related to required transportation improvements c the city shall condition the approval of the development application on one 1 or more of the following acts by the applicant 1 delay or phasing of development
