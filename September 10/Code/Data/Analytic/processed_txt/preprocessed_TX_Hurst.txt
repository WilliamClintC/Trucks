loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of the destruction in floodplains which cause an increase in flood height and velocity and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  52609 purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief effort associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future

subdividers of property to promote sound planning in the subdivision of land in order to prevent errors in platting rather than have the city be required to make expensive future corrections the rules and regulations as set forth in this chapter have been made after careful study by the planning and zoning commission and the city council of existing local conditions and the desirable future of modern subdivision planning principles as recommended by the city staff and consultants and as followed by other progressive cities in this state and this general locality b it is not the desire nor the intent of the city council or the planning commission to regiment the design of subdivisions of property in the city and its environs but rather to recommend the utilization to the fullest possible extent of good sound modern subdivision planning principles it is intended that as much freedom as possible be allowed the individual owners and subdividers in the design and ultimate development of new subdivisions so they will contribute to the community new residential neighborhoods with individuality and character and at the same time provide for sufficient and adequate major and secondary traffic thoroughfares public utilities parks playgrounds and other public grounds that may be required it is also intended by this chapter to preserve the integrity of the plans for the city which have been formulated and to meet the provisions of the zoning ordinance which is designed and intended to stabilize and protect the established pattern of the best land usage of all property within and to be ultimately added to the city c it is suggested that each owner or subdivider of land confer with the city staff before preparing the preliminary plat of his proposed subdivision and secure a copy of the rules and regulations governing subdivisions of land so that he may become thoroughly familiar with the citys subdivision requirements and policies and with the features provisions and recommendations of the various plans for the city that may relate to and have effect upon the general area in which the proposed subdivision is situated a3 plattingrequired

or owners of such land or their duly authorized agent shall obtain the approval of the city council in compliance with the regulations of this chapter an owner may seek approval of a plat of a portion of his land leaving the balance unplatted but the city council may require platting of all or a portion of the balance as a condition of approval of any portion in order to insure proper planning and installation of essential services a4   sameapplication fees required every application for preliminary plat final plat short form plat or replat shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount

amount of four dollars and seven cents $407 per one thousand 1000 gallons of water used or wastewater produced as more specifically set forth hereinafter 3 a monthly volume charge for residential class customers will be based on the individual customers average monthly water use during the preceding winter quarter months of december january and february but in no event shall the volume used to compute this monthly charge exceed twelve thousand 12000 gallons the volumes used to compute these charges are based on the amount of water used by the residential class customer as registered by the meter where no preceding winter quarter average is available from records the water and sewer department shall estimate a volume to be used for this monthly volume charge such estimated volume not to exceed twelve thousand 12000 gallons if the monthly volume of water used by residential class customers for any single month is less than the aforementioned winter quarter average the monthly volume charge for that month will be based on this lesser volume 4 the monthly charges to commercial and industrial class customers will be based on total water use as measured by appropriate meters with the provision that if a customer can show to the satisfaction of the director of public works that a significant portion of the metered water usage does not enter the sanitary sewers the customer will be charged for only that volume entering the sewers as determined by a method approved by the director of public works 5 no sewer service shall be provided to any customer outside the city except on

representative number of establishments in each group and shall apply this rate to the water consumption or metered wastewater as determined in subsection 2664d2 the authority shall then add the appropriate industrial surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each establishment classified into a class group 4 if an establishment contains operations from more than one 1 of the class groups and the authority determines that the surcharge rate for a particular class group would not adequately compensate the city for its cost of treatment the authority may assess a surcharge rate based on a proportional average of the class group rates involved or he may require the establishment to be billed for an industrial surcharge computed under the requirements of
