quality in the city of aberdeen the city shall adhere to all federal and state regulations regarding stormwater management and water quality protection added   regulatory authority the city of aberdeen is required to obtain coverage under the western washington phase ii municipal stormwater permit national pollutant discharge elimination system and state waste discharge general permit for discharges from small municipal separate storm sewers in western washington this permit is in compliance with the provisions of the state of washington water pollution control law rcw and the federal water pollution control act the clean water act title 33 usc  1251 et seq under the federal clean water act the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the united states the npdes stormwater program requires the implementation of stormwater programs phase ii of the npdes rules extends coverage to operators of regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s serving less than one hundred thousand 100000 the washington state department of ecology develops and administers national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes municipal stormwater permits in washington state the phase ii permit authorizes the discharge of stormwater to surface waters and to groundwaters of the state from municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 owned or operated by the permittee city of aberdeen the city is required to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable mep and use all known available and reasonable methods of prevention control and treatment akart to prevent and control pollution of waters of the state of washington added   stormwater quality stormwater is rain and snow melt that runs off rooftops paved streets highways and parking lots as it runs off it picks up pollution like oil fertilizers pesticides soil trash and animal manure most stormwater flows untreated into streams lakes and marine waters according to the department of ecology stormwater runoff is the leading threat to washingtons urban waters streambeds banks and habitats as the population grows in aberdeen urban development increases this results in more developed land and an increase in stormwater runoff and pollution to waters of the state unmanaged stormwater runoff can damage fish habitat contribute to flooding contaminate swimming areas pollute shellfish beds contaminate groundwater and degrade water quality the city works to improve the quality of stormwater runoff by requiring developers and property owners to utilize effective stormwater management principles and proven best management practices bmps when proposing development projects the goal of these requirements comes in the form of the following amanage stormwater as close to the source as possible bmimic natural processes on site that result in infiltration or evapotranspiration cpreserve andor recreate natural vegetation dminimize effective impervious surfaces eslow down stormwater transportation by promoting natural movement of water within an ecosystem the principles above are all part of a land development technique commonly known as low impact development lid proper management of stormwater runoff and implementation of lid practices minimize damage to public and private property reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion and sedimentation assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards reduce local flooding and maintain postdevelopment as nearly as possible the predevelopment runoff characteristics applied on a broad scale lid can maintain or restore a watersheds hydrologic and ecological

proposals particularly those on or near possible aquifer recharge areas should be evaluated as to their potential for groundwater contamination new or expanding existing uses that have the potential to generate leachates that affect groundwater quality should be permitted only if adequate protection measures are employed in site design frequently flooded areas development and nonproject actions should be reviewed as to their compliance under current regulatory provisions preventing damage to property due to frequent flooding projects that utilize fill beyond exempted levels shall be reviewed for their propensity to increase flooding on adjacent properties if it is held that such flooding is possible suitable mitigation measures are to be used to protect adjacent property owners in addition the effect of development on other critical areas that contribute to flood control such as wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat areas should be reviewed and appropriately mitigated geologically hazardous areas in addition to existing city ordinances regulating development in geologically hazardous areas the following strategies should be employed 1proposals on slopes greater than fifteen 15 percent should seek to preserve as much natural vegetation as practical to reduce the risk of erosion or slides 2in those areas considered prone to landslides or extreme erosion specific geotechnical reports are to be prepared that evaluate hazards present and how they will be mitigated 3project design should address the effects of such components as street construction storm water collection and disposal lot size and dimensions and restoration of disturbed lands wetlands development proposals on or adjacent to wetlands as identified in the federal manual for identifying and delineating jurisdictional wetlands shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria 1the capacity of the wetland in controlling or containing general flooding and storm water runoff 2the importance of the wetland in contributing to fish and wildlife habitat 3the recreational and aesthetic value of the wetland to the community 4the economic benefit to the community derived from a development proposal that may diminish the quality or size of a wetland no wetland shall be managed based upon consideration of only one of the above factors  rather the cumulative effect of all of the above values must be weighed in any development review decision the national wetlands inventory map will be used as a reference in determining the presence of wetlands on or near a project site

sma in 1972 to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines the sma requires that the city of aberdeen plan for the use of shorelines of the state within its municipal boundaries the sma and wac established broad policies that give preference to shoreline uses that encourage waterdependent uses uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are unique to or dependent upon use of the states shorelines protect shoreline natural resources including the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life promote public access the publics opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and people generally the sma recognizes that shorelines are among the most valuable and fragile of the states resources the city recognizes and protects private property rights in shoreline jurisdiction while aiming to preserve the quality of these unique resources for all state residents the primary purpose of the sma is to manage and protect the states shoreline resources by planning for reasonable and appropriate uses in order to protect the public interest in preserving these shorelines the sma establishes a coordinated planning program between the city and the state to address development and uses occurring in the states shorelines under the sma the shoreline master program smp was created and implemented based on a cooperative program of shoreline management between the city and the state with citizen contributions collected citys shoreline planning process the city developed this smp and it will implement and administer it permits and reviews the washington state department of ecology ecology provided funding for the update and reviews and approves the citys smp and certain local shoreline permit decisions amended   authority the shoreline management act of 197 rcw is the authority for the enactment and administration of the smp the community development director or an individual designated by the director shall be the administrator of the smp amended   purpose and intent the four 4 purposes of the smp are to acarry out the responsibilities imposed on the city by the sma  bpromote the public health safety and general welfare by providing a guide and regulation for the future development of the shoreline resources of the city  cfurther by adoption the policies of the sma and the goals of the smp  and dcomply with the state smp guidelines wac including a particular focus on regulations and mitigation standards to ensure that development under the smp will not cause a net loss of ecological functions amended   shoreline master program development the cities of aberdeen cosmopolis and hoquiam obtained grant number g1400451 from ecology in 2013 to conduct a comprehensive smp update the cities worked collaboratively smp update process the first step in the update process involved an inventory of the cities shoreline jurisdiction numerous rivers streams and lakes and their associated wetlands floodways and floodplains comprise the cities shoreline jurisdiction combined there are seven thousand four hundred sixtyseven 7467 acres and eightyfive 85 miles of shoreline associated with streams lakes and marine water bodies meeting the definition of shorelines of the state within the cities there are one thousand eight hundred sixtyeight 1868 acres and thirtynine 39 miles of shoreline in aberdeen the public participation plan guided public interaction throughout the development of the smp a citizen advisory committee cac reviewed smp documents particularly proposed shoreline environment designations policies regulations and provided feedback in a series of public meetings the shoreline inventory and characterization described existing biological and physical conditions for the sixteen 16 shoreline reaches covering the cities these reaches were analyzed and characterized to create a baseline from which future development actions in shoreline jurisdiction will be measured a technical advisory committee tac reviewed and commented on the shoreline inventory and characterization the public discussed the findings of the shoreline inventory and characterization and proposed shoreline environment designations at a community meeting shoreline environment designations were assigned for shoreline jurisdiction in the cities then goals policies and regulations for each shoreline environment designation and for all activities subject to the sma were developed to maintain the baseline condition the cac and the public reviewed these documents in the cumulative impacts analysis and the no net loss report the cities analyzed whether the updated smp implemented over time yields no net loss of ecological functions when considering reasonably foreseeable development in shoreline jurisdiction relative to the baseline established by the shoreline inventory and characterization the cities developed the restoration plan to address voluntary nonregulatory actions the cities would take to improve the shoreline jurisdiction above the baseline condition ideally the smp in combination with other city and regional efforts will ultimately produce a net improvement in ecological functions of the shoreline amended   applicability athe smp shall not apply retroactively to existing legally established structures uses and developments in place at the time of ecology adoption of the smp ball proposed uses activities and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to the sma and the smp whether or not a permit or other form of authorization is required except when specifically exempted by statute cin addition to the requirements of the sma permit review implementation and enforcement procedures affecting private property must be conducted in a manner consistent with all relevant constitutional and other legal limitations on the regulation of private property dfederal agencies are subject to this smp and rcw as provided by the coastal zone management act title 16 usc 1451 et seq and wac 173270601 eas

the geographic area in the city subject to the smp referred to in the smp as the citys shoreline jurisdiction according to rcw  the smp applies to the following shorelines of the state within the city athe area between the ordinary high water mark ohwm and the western boundary of the state from cape disappointment on the south to cape flattery on the north including harbors bays estuaries and inlets bsegments of streams or rivers where the mean annual flow is more than twenty 20 cubic feet per second clakes and reservoirs twenty 20 acres and greater in area dshorelands adjacent to these water bodies these include 1lands extending landward for two hundred 200 feet in all directions as measured on a horizontal plane from the ohwm  2adopted federal emergency management agency fema floodways and contiguous floodplain areas landward two hundred 200 feet from such adopted fema floodways  and 3all wetlands and river deltas associated with the streams lakes and tidal waters subject to the sma the following water bodies are subject to the citys smp grays harbor the chehalis river lake aberdeen the wishkah river wedekind creek the wynoochee river charley creek tidal portions of fry creek and newskah creek the city as recommended by the cac and approved by the city council did not choose to include additional areas in shoreline jurisdiction during the smp planning process these additional areas included the following the area beyond the minimum shorelands along stream corridors as defined in the sma the land necessary for buffers for critical areas as defined in a rcw that occur within shorelines of the state the extent of shoreline jurisdiction in the city is depicted on the official shoreline maps included in smp appendix 1 shoreline environment designation maps  the maps only approximately represent the lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction the actual lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction shall be determined on a casebycase basis established by the location of the ohwm the floodway which is defined as the adopted fema floodways adopted floodplains and the presence of associated wetlands in circumstances where shoreline jurisdiction does not include an entire parcel only that portion of the parcel and any use activity or development on that portion of the parcel within shoreline jurisdiction is subject to the smp the actual location of the ohwm floodway floodplain and wetland boundaries shall be determined at the time a development is proposed amended  02 shorelines of statewide significance aadoption of policy in implementing the objectives for shorelines of statewide significance the city based its decisions in preparing the smp on the following policies in order of priority with one 1 being the highest and seven 7 being the

harbors bays estuaries and inlets in the city the grays harbor estuary the chehalis river the wynoochee river and their associated shorelands are defined as shorelines of statewide significance these shorelines are considered resources for all people of the state  thus preference is given to uses that favor longrange goals and support the overall public interest cpolicies for shorelines of statewide significance the statewide interest should be recognized and protected over the local interest in shorelines of statewide significance to ensure that statewide interests are protected over local interests the city shall review all development proposals within shorelines of statewide significance for consistency with rcw  and the following policies 1encourage redevelopment of shorelines where it restores or enhances shoreline ecological functions and processes impaired by prior development activities 2the city should consult with ecology the washington state department of fish and wildlife wdfw the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation the shoalwater bay tribe the quinault indian tribe and other resources agencies for development proposals that could affect anadromous fisheries 3where commercial timber cutting takes place pursuant to rcw  reforestation should take place as soon as feasible 4activities that use shoreline resources on a sustained yield or nonconsuming basis and that are compatible with other appropriate uses should be given priority over uses not meeting these criteria 5the range of options for shoreline use should be preserved to the maximum possible extent for succeeding generations development that consumes valuable scarce or irreplaceable natural resources should not be permitted if alternative sites are available 6potential shortterm economic gains or convenience should be measured against potential longterm andor costly impairment of natural features 7protection or enhancement of aesthetic values should be actively promoted in design review of new or expanding development 8resources and ecological systems of shorelines of statewide significance and those limited shorelines containing unique scarce andor sensitive resources should be protected to the maximum extent feasible 9erosion and sedimentation from development sites should be controlled to minimize adverse impacts on ecosystem processes if site conditions preclude effective erosion and sediment control excavations land clearing or other activities likely to result in significant erosion should be severely limited 10public access development in extremely sensitive areas should be restricted or prohibited all forms of recreation or access development should be designed to protect the resource base upon which such uses in general depend 11public and private developments should be encouraged to provide trails viewpoints water access points and shoreline related recreation opportunities whenever feasible such development is recognized as a high priority use 12development not requiring a waterside or shoreline location should be located inland so that lawful public enjoyment of shorelines is enhanced amended  03 official shoreline

shoreline environment designation system the smas requirements for shoreline environment designations are found in wac 17326211 the city classified and mapped its shoreline jurisdiction into shoreline environment designations based on the following four 4 criteria found in the state smp guidelines wac 173262112a aexisting land use patterns what land uses have developed in each of the shoreline areas to date as documented in the shoreline inventory and characterization report and the smp map folio bbiological and physical character of the shoreline the range of ecological characteristics and functions identified for each of the shoreline reaches documented in the shoreline inventory and characterization report cthe goals and aspirations of the city as expressed comprehensive plan a citys comprehensive plan provides guidance goals and policies land use designations various elements such as land use housing transportation capital facilities and economic development as well as implementing development codes parks and recreation plans subarea plans and other plans dspecific criteria for each shoreline environment designation the specific criteria for the aquatic high intensity shoreline residential and urban conservancy shoreline environment designations are found in wac 173262115 the city may establish different shoreline environment designations provided they are consistent with the purposes and policies of the state smp guidelines based on these four 4 criteria this chapter establishes the shoreline environment designations used in the city for shoreline

team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in wac 365195900  ccharacteristics of a valid scientific process in the context of critical areas protection a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local governments regulatory decisions and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the functions and values of critical areas to determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information the director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process such characteristics are as follows 1peer review the information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline the proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers publication in a refereed scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peerreviewed 2methods the methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and reproducible the methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or if not the methods have been appropriately peerreviewed to ensure their reliability and validity 3logical conclusions and reasonable inferences the conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions the conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained 4quantitative analysis the data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods 5context the information is placed in proper context the assumptions analytical techniques data and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge 6references the assumptions analytical techniques and conclusions are well referenced with citations to relevant credible literature and other pertinent existing information dnonscientific information nonscientific information may supplement scientific information but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information common sources of nonscientific information include the following 1anecdotal information one or more observations that are not part of an organized scientific effort for example i saw a grizzly bear in that area while i was hiking  2nonexpert opinion opinion of a person who is not a qualified scientific expert in a pertinent scientific discipline for example i do not believe there are grizzly bears in that area  and 3hearsay information repeated from communication with others for example at a lecture last week dr smith said there were no grizzly bears in that area eabsence of valid scientific information where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function of permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area the director shall 1take a precautionary or a norisk approach that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved  and 2require application of an effective adaptive
