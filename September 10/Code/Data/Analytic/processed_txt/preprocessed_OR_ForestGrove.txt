parcels the minimum density standards set forth in table 33 focus primarily on subdivisions and multifamily developments  the standards do not apply to individual singlefamily building permits on existing parcels or to partitions or development on parcels smaller than onehalf acre  the city does not want to inhibit infill development or require densities that are out of scale with established neighborhoods with the application of minimum density standards to small parcels however this exemption does not reduce the target density allowed outright on parcels smaller than onehalf acre   it only removes the requirement for a minimum number of units eincentive density planned developments may request a density bonus up to a maximum of the incentive density shown in table 33 and shall be based on the following discretionary criteria 1the availability and accessibility of public transportation andor connectivity improvements likely to result in reduced vehicular use  2how well natural resources such as streams riparian areas and wetlands are protected integrated into the design residential development  defined as a common area and made accessible to as many individual parcelsunits as possible  3how well common recreational areas are integrated into the design of the residential development  such that there is the maximum number of physical connections to lots and units and visual connections to future dwelling sites   4public accessibility and use of the common recreation area where appropriate given the intended use of the area linkage to future trails etc  and 5other

have been identified as forest canopy when it can be shown that such area has less than 60% canopy crown closure and therefore should not have been identified as forest canopy the perimeter of an area delineated as forest canopy on the metro vegetative cover map may be adjusted to more precisely indicate the drip line of the trees within the canopied area provided that no areas providing greater than 60% canopy crown closure are declassified from the forest canopy designation to assert such errors applicants shall submit an analysis of the vegetative cover on their property using the aerial

commission luann arnott thomas beck aaron frye victoria lowe carl al miller lisa nakajima elena uhing  city staff jeffrey s beiswenger aicp senior planner jon r holan community development director  assisted by crandall arambula  adopted  march 2009 amended may 2015  amended march 2016   why do we need design review the community of forest grove has a desire to maintain its small town character and enhance the quality and functionality of its built environment the design review process uses the design guidelines in this handbook to help achieve this goal the guidelines help define the city of forest groves expectations for development and provide a consistent framework to review projects according to specific standards and guidelines  vision for forest grove in 199 the city adopted a vision statement which establishes a series of goals for the community to accomplish by the year 2010 design review is intended to help the city accomplish the following elements of the vision statement small town atmosphere new development should enhance the communitys existing character and help create a livable community for residents workers and visitors vibrant and charming downtown the focus of the community is downtown with its turnofthecentury charm and well maintained historic facades new development should reinforce the positive characteristics of the town center mobility for residents while the importance of the auto is recognized walking bicycling and transit use are also important new development should ensure that all mobility types are fostered and safety is enhanced a prospering city new development should promote the growth and vitality of current business and spur private investment by creating a quality built environment and predictable development framework high environmental quality space to breathe is essential to the community new development should help accomplish this by integrating landscaping open space and existing natural resources into site designs  essential services wellplanned design techniques should consider public safety and security on private property  role of design review the design review process recognizes that there are a variety of ways new development could accomplish design objectives the purpose of the design review process is to provide flexibility and creativity in new development while meeting city requirements and helping projects to achieve community character objectives the design review process is established by the citys development most developments are subject to the citys site plan review process they may or may not be subject to design review the design review process applies only to those projects which are in certain locations  the town center or commercial corridor  or are of a certain development type  multiunit residential mixed use and commercial buildings these locations and types of project have a particular significance and impact on the city and thus deserve the special attention that the design review process brings to them the projects to which design review applies are divided into four separate categories or focus areas depending on their location andor type and each with its own set of applicable design guidelines these focus areas are 1 town center 2 commercial corridor 3 multiunit residential and 4 historic districts and are outlined in detail in the guidelines that make up the bulk of this handbook  the design review process  which track forest grove has a two track design review process for each project to which design review applies the applicant selects the track most appropriate track 1 generally more specific and directive or track 2 potentially more flexible track 1 development standards these applicants refer to parts of the citys development   the projects are required to meet the clear and objective development standards which are provided in the code the standards establish a baseline for design which works in conjunction with other requirements of the development code track 2 design guidelines track 2 applicants refer to the guidelines provided in this document as well as to applicable provisions of the development projects must meet the development standards but would be allowed to vary from these standards if it is demonstrated that related guidelines and objectives were adequately addressed and that the deviation results in a higher quality development than would result under a strict interpretation of the code  the design review process  how does it work thefirst step is that the developer meets with city planning staff in a preapp conference to have an initial discussion about his project this meeting should be held early in the development process because it is a chance to discuss regulations that will affect the project before too much design has been done and to outline how best to proceed the developer then selects which design review track to follow and submits the drawings required under that track to the citys community development department as a design review application the developer has three choices otrack 1  offering the clarity and certainty of meeting clear and objective standards  otrack 2  offering the flexibility of interpreting the guideline intentions  or ocombination of tracks 1 and 2  a combination approach wherein the project may be evaluated by the standards for some categories and by guidelines for the remainder this mixandmatch approach will however kick over the project into the track 2 review body see below at the city level who reviews the project depends on its track and also a size threshold smaller projects are reviewed by planning staff in the community development department while larger projects are subject to planning commission review thus planning staff reviews smaller projects multiunit residential projects of 35 units commercial developments with a total building size less than 10000 square feet for track 1 and 3000 square feet for track 2 planning commission reviews projects larger than those listed above for those larger projects planning staff prepares a detailed staff report for the planning commissioners who then use it to review the project and make a decision after a public hearing all appeals go to the city council if the project is approved by the city by staff planning commission or city council the developer may proceed with the building permit process if the project is not approved the applicant may redesign the project and resubmit or appeal to the state land use board of appeals luba  how to use this document  project design considerations while only track 2 projects are evaluated according to these design guidelines this guidelines handbook is intended to be useful to potential developers who choose track 1 as well because it establishes a framework for the intentions and goals of forest grove development that is whether a developer chooses to follow track 1 or track 2 or a combination of tracks 1 and 2 the end result  quality development in forest grove  should be the same thus the design considerations covered in these guidelines will be relevant for any project that is subject to design review the following diagram outlines the design considerations which should be addressed by applicants to achieve the design review goals and be approved these design considerations are further explained in the guidelines in the remainder of this document   how to use this document  focus areas since the guidelines are divided into three categories or focus areas depending on project location andor type each project must address all guidelines in the focus area that applies to it the general idea of each of the focus areas is as follows 1town center forest grove began as a small farming community with a small downtown and a quality educational institution now pacific university as its nucleus since the communitys inception the town center has been important and still maintains much of its turn of the century charm with numerous intact historic buildings new development in the town center should reinforce the small town atmosphere and the positive qualities of the historic architecture 2commercial corridor forest grove has commercial zoned land running along the pacific avenue 19th avenue couplet as the primary eastwest travel route the character of development along this corridor has a dramatic impact on the perception of the community new development should ensure the functionality and improve the visual quality of the corridor 3multiunit residential forest grove has several areas designated for moderate to high density residential development new development should be compatible with surrounding residential neighborhood and create a safe and functional living environment for residents 4historic districts and landmarks retention and restoration of significant architectural features appropriate use of materials and sensitive new design help preserve and improve the integrity of individual buildings and the district as a whole in this regard the following collective actions help ensure longterm historic district success  maintain the architectural design pattern and details of the original construction and site  maintain the original building materials and use original construction methods  administer new construction thats historically representative of the structure or the district  each focus area guidelines section is subdivided into four categories 1 site 2 building 3 lighting 4 signs  each of these categories in turn includes 1 specific guidelines 2 descriptive statements 3 examples of recommended and not recommended types of development  how to use this document  approval criteria in addition to meeting the specific guidelines within each focus area all development must meet a list of five approval criteria the purpose of the approval criteria is to ensure that when combined all the individual elements of a proposed development result in a high quality project that emphasizes the unique characteristics of forest grove the premise is that the whole should be greater than the sum of its parts the approval criteria are as follows 1complement existing architecture new development shall be consistent with the quality and character of existing architecture in the community 2compatible multiunit housing and mixeduse areas new development shall be compatible with other types of uses and provide a safe pedestrian environment for residents 3dramatic landscape statements new development shall protect important trees and include dramatic landscape treatments 4sensitivity to the natural environment new development shall enhance natural resources and incorporate them into

inception the town center has been important and still maintains much of its turn of the century charm with numerous intact historic buildings this section focus area i establishes specific design review guidelines for new development in the town center the primary intent of the town center focus area is to reinforce the existing positive qualities of the architecture and streetscape while the city is not seeking new development to replicate the architecture of existing buildings new projects should use design elements that reinforce or enhance the character of the town center  applicability the city has two town center zones listed below and illustrated in the map on the following page unless otherwise noted design guidelines apply uniformly to both zones town center core tcc provides for a concentration of retail and office needs in the core commercial area of the city retail or office uses are required on the ground floor with an emphasis on those uses that serve a walkin clientele a combination of office and residential uses are allowed on upper floors design components should work together to form a unified district architectural elements should form a continuous and interesting storefront faade featuring streetscape amenities for the pedestrian shopper town center transition tct is similar in form and specific street front characteristics to the tcc with the primary difference being that retail uses are not required on the ground floor and therefore the vibrant streetscape may also include residential or office activities in cases where a development falls into both the town center focus area and another focus area both sets of guidelines may apply but where they conflict the guidelines for the town center take precedence the following

areas are generally in or close to the town center and commercial corridor the character of multiunit residential development should help provide a transition between the more urban character of commercial areas and lower density residential areas design review can help ensure that new development is compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods and can create a safe and functional living environment for residents the purpose of this section is to establish specific design review requirements for multiunit residential development multiunit residential development is defined as one or more residential structures containing more than one dwelling unit the guidelines are intended not to be prescriptive but rather to meet a variety of multiunit quality housing types commonly found in forest grove and washington county  townhouse  815 unit per acre  courtyardgarden  1623 unit per acre  condominiumlofturban housing  24 unit per acre and above applicability the city has a variety of areas that are designated for multiunit housing primarily multiunit housing is focused on land zoned either  residential multiunit low rml  residential multiunit high rmh land zoned community commercial cc and neighborhood mixed use nmu also allows multiunit development the design standards and guidelines in this section apply to multiunit development in these districts with multiunit being defined as buildingswhich include at least three dwelling units however within the nmu zone these standards may be modified approved mixeduse planned development mupd while multiunit residential development is also allowed in town center zones its character in those areas can be significantly different from that of the commercial corridor and residential zoning districts residential development in the town center is subject to the town center guidelines found in in the rml rmh cc and nmu zones these multiunit residential design guidelines apply to the multiunit types

applicant should address how well the proposed plan promotes the unique character of forest grove new development shall reinforce positive characteristics of town center improve visual character of commercial corridor and complement the character of neighborhoods each building or addition shall fit within the context of its greater surroundings and environment in terms of overall street impact scale and configuration forest grove has unique characteristics derived from its history  role as a regional center for the surrounding agricultural areas  and relationship to institutional uses such as pacific university property developed within the city has certain design characteristics which should be emphasized by new development in the town center new development should enhance the historic character of the town center buildings which disrupt the character would not meet the criteria in all focus areas projects should be functionally and aesthetically compatible with surrounding properties and the community as a whole multiunit residential projects should be compatible with adjacent neighborhoods and create a safe and functional environment for residents all projects subject to design review shall demonstrate that they meet the five approval criteria listed below and described on the following pages the applicant should include a written response to each criterion as part

welldesigned streetscapes   top view of historic buildings in the town center bottom city entrance east   criterion 1  complements existing architecture new development shall be consistent with the quality and character of existing architecture in the community forest grove has a number of architecturally significant and welldesigned institutional commercial and residential buildings some dating back to the early 1850s eg old college hall 1850 these structures enhance the community character of the community and establish a highquality design standard development should maintain and restore significant historic details on existing buildings new buildings should be architecturally compatible with neighboring buildings new buildings built in forest grove should enhance rather than detract from the existing character of the community the desired architectural character should vary depending on the location within the community large monolithic buildings lacking architectural details are discouraged   top view of a renovated historic building in the town center located on main street bottom view of goodwill store on pacific avenue   criterion 2  compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods multiunit residential developments shall be compatible with adjacent lower density residential development as well as commercial development some of the earliest buildings in the town center were hotels as early as 1870 and dormitories for the college many of the early twentieth century downtown buildings featured apartments above the storefronts the neighborhoods immediately surrounding the town center and along forest groves commercial corridor have historically contained some higher density housing intermixed with single family homes the community also has a number of elderly housing facilities many residents of these housing types have limited access to vehicles and need a safe walking environment three different types of built environments allow multiunit development in forest grove town center commercial corridor and residential neighborhoods new development should provide safe pedestrian environments be accessible to nearby commercial areas and provide a safe well designed atmosphere to meet the needs of residents project which are disconnected from surrounding neighborhood eg lacking pedestrian connections excessive setbacks large parking areas no visibility from public streets are discouraged   top welldesigned modern apartment complex bottom upper level residential units   criterion 3  creates dramatic landscape statements landscaping shall be used to create a design theme for a project complement the building architecture screen objectionable views and enhance privacy landscape features are key determinant of community character in the city forest grove was named for a grove of large trees present on the tualatin academy campus in the 1840s the community has several examples of dramatic landscaping treatments eg citys eastern entrance  historic grand lodge which helps define its character forest grove is also a tree city usa and has a recognition program for significant trees landscaping should be used to create a design theme for a project landscaping should be integrated into the design of developments to complement building architecture and create visual relief landscaping should also be used to screen objectionable views and enhance privacy landscaping should also be used for environmental benefits such as reducing stormwater runoff and providing shade landscaping that blocks visibility creates safety concerns and interferes with utilities should be avoided the use of invasive nonnative species is discouraged   top sidewalk connection in parking lot middle landscaping along public street bottom entrance sign with landscaping at apartment complex   criterion 4  sensitivity to the natural environment site plans shall be designed to avoid impacts to natural resources and integrate these resources into site plans for the enjoyment of residents the citizens of forest grove have a long tradition of respect for the natural environment in fact one of the early ordinances adopted by the city was a tree preservation ordinance the early settlement of the city was sited between two major waterways and until recently has primarily developed away from the floodplains and wetlands associated with these waterways avoiding impacts to natural riparian systems the city has also avoided impact to natural resources by developing in a relatively compact fashion when near natural resources new developments are required to avoid potential impacts site plans should avoid impacts to natural resources natural resources should be integrated into developments for the enjoyment of residents existing trees should be avoided when possible development that utilizes extensive paved areas and degrades wetlands or riparian areas should be avoided   top known as the tree this giant

these forest grove historic districts design guidelines were originally developed by michelle dennis and members of the historic landmarks board they have been updated and reformatted into the historic design review handbook along with the new development by the office of robert dortignacq architect in cooperation with the city of forest grove between october 2013 and july 2014 the ordinance to adopt the guidelines and standards was approved by the city council on  this publication has been funded with the assistance of a matching grantinaid from the oregon state historic

george cushing kaylene toews holly tsur larry wade  city of forest grove james reitz aicp senior planner jon holan community development director  introduction these historic district design guidelines have been developed to provide property owners and the historic landmarks board with guidance for the preservation restoration rehabilitation and maintenance of historic landmarks and new construction within forest groves historic districts they are based on the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation retention and restoration of significant architectural features appropriate use of materials and sensitive new design help preserve and improve the integrity of individual buildings and the district as a whole in this regard the following collective actions help ensure longterm historic district success  maintain the architectural design pattern and details of the original construction and site  maintain the original building materials and use original construction methods  administer new construction thats historically representative of the structure or the district   guidelines and standards in the interest of flexibility the strategy adopted by forest grove to accomplish the above integrates both guidelines and standards development standards clear objective and verifiable requirements provided in the code that protect forest groves architectural heritage these standards establish a baseline for design which works in conjunction with other requirements of the development guidelines recognizing that no set of standards can be perfect the guidelines provide guidance on how construction might deviate from the standards and yet still accomplish the goal of protecting our architectural heritage all projects must meet the development standards but projects would be permitted to deviate from the standards in some ways if it is demonstrated that the related design guidelines have been addressed and that deviations would result in a higher quality development in practice this strategy engenders a twotrack procedure designs or portions of a project not meeting or those requesting an exception to the standards track 1 shall be reviewed under the design guidelines track 2 correspondingly a twocolumn approach has been adopted in the body of this document labeled track 1 development standards the righthand column assumes that a project meets all the requirements set forth in the design standards development dc  procedure for review of proposed work affecting the exterior of landmarks the body of this column presents a summary of the development standards that apply to the particular section plus illustrative photos for the actual wording of the design standards see  cited above labeled track 2 design guidelines the lefthand column gives the guidelines and illustrative photos that provide information on how a project might deviate from the development standards that are summarized in the righthand column projects that elect to follow track 2 versus track 1 must receive historic landmarks board approval  applicability the development standards in this section apply to the exterior rehabilitation of buildings within one of the historic districts situations include existing historic contributing buildings additions or new development and to individually listed historic resources outside of the districts certain provisions apply to all properties the development standards themselves make recommendations that can be applied to many different resource types including buildings sites structures objects and districts there are additional considerations that may affect preservation or rehabilitation projects including land use and building codes before undertaking any exterior work on historic resources  et seq historic landmarks should be followed these design guidelines are consistent with the citys ordinances please note that those properties receiving tax benefits oregon special assessment program are subject to stricter standards for historic compatibility and require approval from the state historic preservation office properties within the historic districts may be eligible for benefits if qualifications are met including the citys historic preservation renovation grants a matching grant program information about renovation grants is available on the citys website wwwforestgroveorgov  history of building types in forest grove because the districts developed over several years in conjunction with the overall growth and development of forest grove they not only represent the broad spectrum of community residents they also represent a wide range of architectural styles and trends including local variations in general houses built for the working class were smaller and less elaborate than houses built for the middle and upper classes merchants and professionals were more inclined and better able to afford elaborate houses designed by architects and constructed with the finest materials architectural styles and their variants built in forest grove during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are indicated in table 1 table 1 forest grove architectural styles and variants  century architectural style variants 19th second empire victorian italianate victorian stick victorian queen anne victorian queen anne eastlake cottage free

eaveless tract houses  these images depict actual homes located in forest grove 2    wood was the most commonly used building material in the historic districts most of the historic buildings are of woodframed construction with some form of wood siding windows doors and architectural ornamentations were wooden many of the early homes in forest grove had only rudimentary foundations  but over time this changed currently almost all historic buildings sit on either poured concrete or concrete block foundations  however some foundations are composed of concrete and stone or concrete and brick many early roofs in forest grove were built using wood shingles with composition roofing introduced in the early 1900s there are a number of examples of historically significant houses both in and outside of the districts built using the taylor process hollow wall concrete construction patented method developed in the 1920s this construction utilized a concrete double wall with an air space most of these structures are clad with stucco but have woodframed roofing systems there are historically significant nonresidential buildings located in each of the historic districts central school located in the clark district is an excellent example of the 20th century period revival style of architecture with tudor style elements typical of schools built in the 1930s central school is of brick construction historic churches in the districts display the typical gothic revival elements most commonly in the arched windows the original portions of these churches were often constructed of wood although later additions include materials such as brick and stucco among the architects and builders who contributed to the development of forest grove were harley mcdonald william borchardt em

from its floor to its ceiling is below grade for a minimum of 50% of its perimeter block face refers to historic contributing buildings on the particular block face and on the same side of the street as the applicant property  may use historic noncontributing houses if there are no historic contributing buildings building line the line where the building or structure intersects grade at open walls the eave line shall be used building parts  main portion refers to the central building mass front portion the front section of the building  extends back one room or ten feet from the front wall wings refers to a subsidiary and extension portion of the building  at least one room in size bay refers to a room projection it may extend to grade the floor level or may be raised it may have its own roof historic buildings means historic contributing buildings unless noted otherwise oblique nonorthogonal skewed front walls front walls that are not parallel or at a 90 degree angle to their side walls primary building side the most architecturally significant side typically the front and the side that faces the street and that typically has the main entry secondary building sides non primary sides visible sides or portions portions of the building visible from the adjacent streets or public way for other building terms see the appendix of the design review handbook  building and addition placement intent maintain the open space and block defining qualities of the historic districts the building and addition placement section includes the following guidelines  orientation  spacing  setbacks   building and addition placement guideline preserve the historic open space qualities setbacks and building orientation determined by the historic buildings of the district description although there is not a uniform setback or spacing of houses in forest groves historic districts buildings are usually set back from the street on the lot with a relatively sizable front yard which includes a wide parkway between street and sidewalk buildings in a residential district are generally located on lots so that open space exists between them lot widths and building widths vary but there is generally a repetitive pattern of buildings and open space created by side yards and driveways between buildings    track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended  orientation locate and position new buildings similar to the historic buildings on the block face  orient the building front towards the street building entries should be at the front of the building facing and accessing the street  position additions at the rear of the building if possible occasionally a side ell may be an appropriate addition new structures and additions are not recommended on the front faade  moving or repositioning a historic building or structure may affect its historic significance and needs to be reviewed carefully  spacing maintain the pattern of buildings set apart by open spaces between them as established historically in the district and block face  removal of nonhistoric additions is encouraged as is reconstruction of missing historic features and additions with proper documentation  maintain public parking strips sidewalks and street trees as appropriate for the block face setbacks maintain consistency in the historic pattern of setbacks and building spacing throughout each block front setbacks should be yards perhaps with driveways along the sides of the buildings  new construction setbacks for all buildings should match those of the surrounding historic buildings  the front setback should be a yard not a parking area related orientation locate the primary building side and entry of the building to face the public way this side is typically parallel to the street maintain a similar orientation of the neighboring historic buildings  additions are not allowed onto the primary side of a historic building  new structures or additions are not allowed in the front yard  existing historic buildings or structures may not be moved or repositioned without guideline review see   spacing maintain the existing front and side spacing and building placement determined by historic buildings within the block face  removal of nonhistoric features or reconstruction of historic features with documentation is allowed on historic buildings see ivi  maintain parkways and sidewalk alignment for the block face see   setbacks maintain and preserve the front yard setback as determined by historic buildings within the block face existing noncomplying historic as well as nonhistoric structures may remain and may be repaired but not enlarged  maintain average side yard setbacks as determined by historic buildings on the block face  accessory dwelling units adu either attached or detached the side yard is governed by  table 37    typical spacing and setback found in the districts new construction set back or brought forward from the street in ways that cause misalignment disrupts the rhythm of the historic development pattern new construction that maintains the existing setbacks fits better into the historic streetscape mixed home sizes as found in the districts note orientation to street and parkway new construction in the district that maintains historic setback spacing and orientation qualities an example of 2 story residences in the district illustrating the historic spacing and openness qualities mixed shapes sizes and styles in the districts displaying the historic spacing and orientation qualities   building design intent the intent of the building design guidelines section is to preserve the unique historic contributing qualities of the historic districts for existing historic buildings the particular interest is to provide direction for sustaining those resources as they require maintenance and alterations the intent for nonhistoric buildings and new development is to provide guidance for the design of their new construction and alterations such that the end result does not deter or diminish the overall historic qualities of the historic districts a compatible new building or addition should complement the existing pattern of the historic district this involves designing buildings that use an architectural style that is similar to its neighbors historical photographs can help in this regard occasionally a property owner wishes to increase the living space within an existing building in fact a number of historic buildings in forest grove have had additions constructed the building design section includes the following guidelines  height  width  shape  roofs dormers and roof features  porches  front side and rear elevations  outbuildings and garages  exterior siding and decorative architectural details  doors and windows  foundations   building size scale and compatibility guideline the existing historic buildings sizes scale and shapes in the district should be evaluated and respected when considering modifications additions or when constructing new buildings description buildings in the historic districts are generally one oneandahalf or two stories in height as are the churches and central school    track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended  maintain elements that define the existing size scale relationship to the ground and site shape and architectural styles of historic buildings in the district  additional floors are generally not appropriate attempt to gain additional floor space use of additions to the rear or side of the building or by the addition of appropriate dormers on the roof to create additional space on the attic level  the size and scale of new buildings should be consistent with surrounding buildings in the district  any additions should be compatible with the original building design and architectural style  except in limited locations very large buildings such as mansions or large apartment complexes are inappropriate in the district larger buildings should generally be located at corners and smaller buildings should generally be located in the midblock  no addition should overwhelm the scale of the building  the additional space should be compatible in design but distinguishable from the original building compatible materials and construction techniques should be used  additions should be made so that if the addition ever were to be removed there is minimal damage to the original structure  the site shall not be significantly regraded or altered for the purpose of gaining additional stories or building size   1 story   1  story2 stories 1 storybasement related height  height limit at eave or parapet the height from grade at the building line to the predominant roof eave that exists for historic buildings on the block face up to a maximum of 25 feet historic noncontributing buildings may be used if there are no historic contributing buildings on the block face  height limit at ridge the height from grade at the building line to the main roof ridge that exists for historic buildings on the block face up to 10 feet above the allowable eave height  the maximum number of above grade stories is 2  the height or number of stories of the front portion of historic buildings may not be increased  historic buildings may be raised no more than 3 feet from their existing height  the maximum height from grade at the building line to the main level for new buildings is 4 feet  basements are allowed for all buildings the site may not be substantially regraded for basement use width  the width of a new building front may not vary more or less than 20% from the range that exists for historic buildings on the block  the front width of historic buildings may not be increased more than 10% shape  the overall primary building shape and that of additions must be representative of existing historic buildings on the block face  additions to historic buildings shall be designed to be secondary to the main building  oblique skewed and nonorthogonal front walls are not allowed on the primary building  rounded walls or porches are allowed for secondary walls or additions     example of a singlestory cottage raised 3 feet to allow lower level improvements  the historic relationship to the

utilize the existing roof shapes and qualities of the historic buildings as a guide for alterations and new work roof forms vary in shape and pitch most are of moderate pitch although there are examples of steeply pitched and shallow roofs the majority of roofs are gabled or hipped although there are also examples of gambrel roofs and clipped gable or jerkinhead roofs   track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended  the repair and alteration of roofs should match the original shape and pitch generally the same roof pitch should be used for additions  the same roof type and material should be used for additions  the roof form of new buildings should be compatible with that of neighborhood buildings  distinctive decorative features such as dormers character defining chimneys and exposed rafter tails should be retained new dormers generally should have the same character as the existing roof for example a gabled dormer on a gabled roof and should be designed in proportion to the roof area and other windows in the house  dormers that did not exist historically should be kept to the rear of the house and out of view from the public rightofway whenever possible  do not install roof features that never existed or that create a false historical appearance this may include cupolas cresting or ornate and corbelled chimneys skylights roof vents new chimneys and flues mechanical systems and roof decks should be as inconspicuous as possible from the public rightofway  restoration of missing historic features with proper documentation is encouraged  when feasible roof materials should be repaired or replaced in kind match the original patterns textures and materials when possible when repair or replacement of an original material is not possible the use of composition shingles is acceptable  inappropriate roofing materials include metal tile concrete and vinyl these materials should be avoided unless there is clear evidence that they were used when the building was constructed  related roofs  roof forms for the main structure additions and wings where visible are to be gabled or hipped shed roofs are not allowed for the main building portion parapets and nonvisible roofs are not allowed for the main roof unless represented by historic buildings on the block  roof shape shall be consistent with other historic buildings on the block in style configuration and pitch  roofs shall have a minimum of 12 overhang or the average of historic buildings on the block face  gable roofs shall have matching roof slopes  porches or bays may have lower sloped roofs than that of the main roof these roofs may be gabled hipped shed or more complex  shallow stepped gable roofs a maximum of 2 are allowed  the roof shape and slope of the main portion on historic buildings as visible shall not be changed  roofing types not allowed where visible sheet metal clay concrete or metal tile single ply types  gutters and downspouts  types allowed painted sheet metal copper  types not allowed vinyl plastic except as a downspout receiver hub visible for a maximum of 12 above grade    example of a new building with complying roof and

roof on a new home example of noncomplying shed roof shapes and sheet metal roofing materials    dormers and roof features  dormers on all buildings are to match the existing building style shape and relative proportion dormers shall intersect the main roof below the main ridge  new dormers are not allowed on a front sloping roof of historic buildings  a maximum of 2 dormers are allowed on the front of new buildings  the total area for all dormers on a particular slope is limited to 33% for gable roofed dormers and 50% for shed roofed dormers  new decorative roof feature additions such as cupolas towers crestings railings are not allowed  chimneys on historic buildings retain and repair above the roofline  skylights are not allowed on the front sloping roof  solar panels satellite dishes mechanical equipment are not allowed on the roof or walls of the front building portion this includes the front and sides extending back 10 feet examples of complying historic dormers examples of excessive and outofscale dormers   porches guideline preserve the front porch and entry of historic buildings utilize those existing historic front porches as a design clue for new construction description a front porch is a characteristic feature of many historic homes serving as the transition from the street to the interior of the house and providing outdoor living space as well as protection from the weather the front porch designates the front and primary entry for the house   track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended  avoid removing original porches and their distinctive features such as posts railings and stairs  or replacing them with incompatible porches that destroy or cover up characterdefining features of the house  repair porch elements whenever possible if repair is not possible replacement of materials should be in kind and original design and details should be retained  porches should not be enclosed unless the railings detail and open quality of the porch are carefully preserved  when trying to replicate a historic porch that has been removed base the replacement design on historic photographs and historical research and documentation if no photographs or written descriptive evidence are available use a period design that is suitable for the style of architecture replicating trim details and siding materials of the house  porch repairs and replacements should conform to current building codes related to railing height spindle spacing step spacing etc  the use of porches should be compatible with that of surrounding historic buildings and consistent with the buildings architecture if the nearby houses have porches consider designing the new building with a porch that is compatible in style and scale or if the nearby houses are of a vintage where porches were not included the new building should be designed without a front porch or with one that is modest and does not draw attention to itself or defines the main entry otherwise  porches on new buildings shall respect the style character of existing historic buildings on the block face upper level porches may be allowed if represented on the block face new porches stairs and components shall integrate with and match the style materials and finishes of the building related new porches shall comply with the above requirements for spacing setback building form shape and roofs  new front porches must have front street access  new porches on all buildings are to match the existing building style shape and proportion  porches on historic buildings shall not be removed or relocated  new houses and accessory dwelling units adus shall incorporate a porch or architecturally defined entry for each main level unit unless sharing an existing porch or entry the minimum porch dimensions are four feet by four feet and sixteen square feet per dwelling unit  porches shall have roofs and are to be integrated with the building and finished accordingly they shall be consistent with the main buildings style  front porches and roofs shall serve the main level and be one story in height  raised front and visible side porches require finished enclosures or skirting below their walk structure consistent with the main building style  front porches on historic buildings may not be enclosed  side porches serving the main or basement level are allowable they are to be secondary but consistent in style and detail with the front porch  porches above the main level on the front of the building are not allowed unless existing elsewhere on historic buildings on the block face  new exterior stairs are allowed for ground floor entrances only  raised decks visible from the street are not allowed  materials not allowed  exposed

front side and rear elevations guideline preserve the defining qualities the front elevation with minimal alterations description the front elevations of buildings in the historic districts are generally considered the main facades they are sometimes distinguished from the side and rear elevations by the use of more elaborate architectural detail and ornamentation    track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended maintain the front facade orientation to the street or corner unless historic orientation was different original features of each elevation such as porches balconies bay windows and trim details should be retained and rehabilitated additions to buildings should be located on the rear and side elevations note the front portion includes the first ten feet of the sides additions and alterations on historic buildings shall be historically appropriate and consistent and shall use representative products and materials the design of new buildings or alterations to nonhistoric or historic noncontributing buildings shall not worsen the integrity of the block face or historic district avoid creating a false historical appearance that is incompatible with the style of the building rehabilitation should be based on sound pictorial or documented evidence  related the front faade orientation and access for historic buildings shall be maintained the major defining features including entry porches roofline bays and dormers shall be retained on the front and visible sides of historically contributing buildings the front faade orientation and access for new buildings shall be consistent with historic building examples on the block front faade new buildings shall avoid very flat wide and tall front and visible side walls with minimal relief and level parapets the front shall create relief by a limited use of projections and recesses such as a porch bay wing or the roof slope openings new buildings shall have windows on the front and visible sides of habitable spaces at each level each such space shall have a minimum of one window rear elevation unless specifically noted as significant the rear and not visible side elevations of historic buildings may be altered those alterations must be consistent with the overall building design and use products and materials noted as acceptable in the standards     outbuildings and garages guideline garages and outbuildings are important but secondary structures for the historic building description garages and outbuildings should not be overlooked as important components of historic properties there are a number of historic garages in forest grove alterations or additions to these buildings should follow these guidelines    track 2 design guidelines track 1 development standards recommended  whenever possible original garages or outbuildings should be retained or restored and maintained rather than replaced  whenever possible retain and repair historic materials or replace them in kind  if replacing a historic garage use photographic documentation to guide the design for the replacement early garages were often designed to match the house  replacement of such garages should take such design and materials usage into account  if constructing a new garage for a historic property the size and scale of the garage should be compatible with the historic house for which it is being constructed the shape and pitch of the garage roof and siding materials should match that of the house  the key element in garage design is the door repair original garage doors whenever possible if replacement is necessary avoid overhead roll doors unless the garage is recent enough to have an overhead roll door originally consider using typical early garage doors which are often sidehinged paneled bifolds with the top third glazed it is possible to construct sidehinged bifold doors that can be activated with a garage door opener  houses built after world war ii might have had a carport rather than a garage as with garages these should be designed to be compatible with the historic house related new garages and accessory buildings shall be historically consistent with the primary building in style size materials and roof  replacement garages retain and repair over replacement for both structure and materials  location and orientation where an alley exists locate the garage for alley access garages and outbuildings shall be located in the rear where possible garages may be located in the side yard or may be attached if recessed behind the primary building face by a minimum of six feet and if meeting the side yard setback and spacing requirements  garage doors total width is limited to  of the primary building face width if facing a street height is limited to eight feet construction style and materials shall be consistent with the main building a maximum of one double garage door or two single doors facing the street is
