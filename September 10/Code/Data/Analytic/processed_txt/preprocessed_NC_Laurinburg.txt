building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the retail sales and services classification however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping center has not changed  19 article 6 zoning districts 2 a mere change in the status of property from

introduction the following supplemental regulations shall pertain to the uses listed in the table of uses and activities located in which are identified with an s for supplemental regulations for any use which requires the issuance of a conditional use permit the supplemental use regulations listed herein may be in addition to any other fair and reasonable conditions placed on the use by the city council the conditions may impose greater restrictions on a particular use than those which are listed herein accessory uses  the table of uses and activities  classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use 1 constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or 2 is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a zoning permit  for purposes of interpreting subsection  1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is of minor consequence in and of itself or is subordinate in relation to the principal use 2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness  without limiting the generality of subsections  and  the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above 1 offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry an administrative or artistic

unless otherwise specifically provided in this eg nonconforming signs and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this be continued  nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of nonconforming lots  when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily residence that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot  when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements  cannot reasonably be complied with then the entity authorized by this issue a permit for the proposed use the udo administrator board of adjustment or city council may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations  2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety  for purposes of subsection  compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible  2 article 8 nonconforming situations  this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with  subject to the following sentence if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations  except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements  subject to subsection  a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building  subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a sand pit may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming  3 article 8 nonconforming situations situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur  notwithstanding subsection  any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations  notwithstanding subsection  whenever i there exists a lot with one or more structures on it  and ii a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot  and iii the parking or loading requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with i parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and ii such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or conditional use permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit the purpose of this subsection is to encourage the continued use of an existing building when a change in use would require more parking spaces than can be accommodated on the building lot this subsection is not intended to be a mechanism to circumvent the parking requirements of this ordinance and is applicable only to situations involving change in use of an existing building repair maintenance and reconstruction  minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than twentyfive percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a conditional use permit issued pursuant to this section  if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twentyfive percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a conditional use permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in  4 article 8 nonconforming situations  for purposes of subsections  and  1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections  and  by doing such work incrementally 3 the appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser  the board of adjustment shall issue a conditional use permit authorized by this section if it finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 there is no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming use  2 there is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking loading and landscaping requirements  and 3 there is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety in issuing a conditional use permit the board may affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions such as but not limited to landscaping and buffering to separate dissimilar uses or to screen parking and loading areas change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists  a change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or conditional use permit in accordance with may not be made except in accordance with subsections  however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed  if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as  5 article 8 nonconforming situations permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status  if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the board of adjustment issues a conditional use permit authorizing the change this conditional use permit may be issued if the board of adjustment finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of   and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this section that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this section is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created  if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the board of adjustment issues a conditional use permit authorizing the change the board of adjustment may issue the conditional use permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning or conditional use permit  and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection  of this section are satisfied  and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for  6 article 8 nonconforming situations abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations  when a nonconforming use is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes  if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the board of adjustment issues a conditional use permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this conditional use permit may be issued if the board of adjustment finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the conditional use permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected  for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter  when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this the 180day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this 7 completion of nonconforming projects  all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction in addition as provided in gs 160a385b neither this ordinance nor any amendment to it shall without the consent of the property owner affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been  7 article 8 nonconforming situations issued pursuant to gs 160a417 prior to the enactment of the ordinance making the change so long as the building permit remains valid unexpired and unrevoked  except as provided in subsection  all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning conditional use or sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this issue permits for the type of development proposed the permit issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the permit issuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building zoning sign or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective 2 except as provided in subsection 1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of i the total estimated cost of the proposed project and ii the ordinary business practices of the developer  8 article 8 nonconforming situations 6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him 7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the permit issuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the permit issuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that i at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures 8 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the permit issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the permit issuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming  when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection  ln addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subsection 1 the permit issuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations  9 article 8 nonconforming situations  the permit issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection  that is submitted more than sixty days after the effective date of this permit issuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year  the udo administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for tax purposes and developers if different from the owners of all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development this notice shall be sent by certified mail not less than fifteen days before the effective date of this the permit issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section these applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of this so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted nonconforming signs  signs in existence on the effective date of this do not conform to the provisions of this but which were constructed erected affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations shall be regarded as nonconforming signs although it is not the intent of the encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as follows 1 no nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign 2 no nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for periodic change of message 3 no nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape size type or design of the sign other than to make the sign conforming 4 no nonconforming sign shall be reestablished after the activity business or use to which it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed 5 no nonconforming sign shall be reestablished and all remains of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds fifty percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction if damaged by less than fifty percent but repairs are not made within three months of the time such damage occurred the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be removed  10 article 8 nonconforming situations 6 no nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless the sign can be made to conform with this its new location  signs located on premises which come within the zoning jurisdiction of the city of laurinburg after the effective date of this which signs do not comply with the provisions of this be subject to the requirements listed above  any nonconforming sign which is structurally altered relocated or replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this signs in existence on the effective date of this do not comply with provisions regulating use of strobe lights ziplights flashing lights or rotating beacons  flags streamers or strings of lights  or permanently installed or situated merchandise shall be made to conform within ninety days from the effective date of this the udo administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed accordingly the udo administrator shall give ninety days written notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign within ninety days after the ninetyday written notice has been given the udo administrator or his duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings according to the procedures specified in gs 160a175  offpremises signs that are protected from enforced removal by the outdoor advertising control act shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection  unless and until just compensation is provided in accordance with the cited statute termination of

performance standards flexibility in administration authorized  the requirements set forth in this article concerning the amount size location and nature of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with multifamily residential and manufactured home park developments are established by the council as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted city plans the council recognizes however that due to the particular nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the permit issuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that i the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and ii because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards  whenever the permit issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this article pursuant to subsection  the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a

served by the street may be used as a useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive  3 whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety both within and outside of the subdivision  the classification of streets shall be as follows 1 minor a street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties it serves or is designed to serve not more than nine dwelling units and is expected to or does handle up to seventyfive trips per day 2 local a street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties it serves or

for new driveway entrances or requests for modifications to existing driveway entrances when not associated with a zoning special use or conditional use permit request shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer the city engineer shall issue a driveway permit in such cases specifications for driveway entrances are set forth in the city of laurinburg construction standards if driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements this shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection   for purposes of this section the term prima facie evidence means that the permitissuing authority may but is not required to conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed development complies with subsection   63 article 9 performance standards street connectivity requirements  an interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public health safety

general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to  restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities   require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction   control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters   control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and  prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  83 article 9 performance standards the objectives of are to  protect human life safety and health   minimize

zoning amended  the zoning of a relatively small area of land differently from the way the majority of the surrounding land is zoned spot zoning is legal only if the government establishes that it is reasonable reasonableness is determined by considering the size of the area  any special conditions or factors regarding the area  the consistency of the zoning with the land use plan  the degree of change in the zoning  the degree it allows uses different from the surrounding area  and  page a34 appendix a appendix a definitions the relative benefits and detriments for the owner the neighbors and the surrounding community the city of laurinburg should consider the following factors in deliberating any potential spot zoning 1 the size and nature of the tract  the larger the area of spot zoning the more likely it is to be reasonable singling out an individual lot for special zoning treatment is more suspect than creating a zoning district that involves multiple parcels and owners special site characteristics such as topography availability of utilities or access to rail or highways can be important in this analysis 2 compatibility with existing plans  if a clear public policy rationale for the different zoning treatment is set out in the local governments adopted plans that evidences a public purpose for the zoning by contrast a zoning action that is inconsistent with a plan may indicate special treatment that is contrary to the public interest and thus be unreasonable 3 the impact of the zoning decision on the landowner the immediate neighbors and the surrounding community  an action that is of great benefit to the owner and only a mild inconvenience for the neighbors may be reasonable while a zoning decision that significantly harms the neighbors while only modestly benefitting the owner would be unreasonable 4 the relationship between the newly allowed uses in a spot rezoning and the previously allowed uses  the degree of difference in the existing surrounding land uses and the proposed new use is also important the greater the difference in allowed uses the more likely the rezoning will be found unreasonable for example in an area previously zoned for residential uses allowing slightly higher residential density may be reasonable while allowing industrial uses would be unreasonable 5 ownership  in order to constitute spot zoning the area to be rezoned must be owned by a single owner start of construction includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued provided the actual start of construction repair
