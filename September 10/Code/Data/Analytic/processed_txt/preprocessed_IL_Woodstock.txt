rezoning petition in lasalle national bank of chicago v county of cook 12 ill2d 40 145 ne 2d 65 the illinois supreme court established six factors to be considered when reviewing a zoning request subsequently in the case of sinclair pipeline company v village of richton park 19 ill 2d 370 167 ne2d 406 the supreme court added two other factors the factors in these cases constitute the legal basis for the review of zoning decisions by a local government and are summarized below 1 the existing uses and zoning of nearby property are the adjoining property uses consistent with the proposed use are there any conflicts between the proposed zoning district and the uses allowed therein and the uses either allowed or existing on nearby properties moreover what is meant by the term nearby zoning has to begin and end somewhere and just because a use exists on one side of a street does not mean it must extend across it often streets are used as zoning demarcation lines 2 the extent to which property values are diminished by particular zoning restrictions an increase in property value because of a change in allowable uses by itself is not a basis for rezoning rather it is only one factor to be considered and must be weighed against any real or potential detriment to the public welfare resulting from the zoning change 3 the extent to which the destruction of property values of the applicant promotes the health safety morals or general welfare of the public this is both a fact question and also a policy question as it relates to the proposed use 4 the relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner for example in considering a proposed commercial rezoning next to a residential area one consideration would be the impact on the residences as compared to the benefit to the entire community of having a commercial development in the proposed location 5 the suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes under this consideration topography soils parcel size and location and other physical characteristics of the parcel to be rezoned are examined to see if the zoning is appropriate 6 the length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the immediate area and the general vicinity of the subject property this criterion is more relevant to infill properties than to outlying vacant lands proposed to be annexed to the city in the former the length of time the property is vacant may suggest that current zoning is inappropriate and that rezoning is appropriate in the latter case unannexed land that has been vacant does not in and of itself necessarily suggest rezoning is appropriate 7 the community need for the proposed use one weighs the need in the community for the proposed zoning change for example the city may consider whether sufficient commercial zoning already exists or whether a rezoning is appropriate due to a scarcity of multiplefamily zoning 8 the care in which the community has undertaken to plan its land use development here the courts look at a citys comprehensive planning documents to determine if previous proposals have been made to the plan regarding the land being rezoned if zoning is challenged it is helpful if the city has a record with regard to existing zoning being consistent with its comprehensive plan if the plan suggests the rezoning of the property it is difficult to defend against it also past comprehensive planning efforts in the municipality may indicate the weight to be accorded the citys decision 44 special use permits  application filing unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  13 an application for a special use permit verified by the owner or

section establishes required approval procedures for vacating plats streets alleys easements public places or parts thereof commentary to implement the goal of protecting sensitive natural resources these regulations encourage subdivisionplanned unit development design that preserves natural resources and other significant environmental features the following stepbystep conservation design process provides guidance in designing developments which acknowledge the importance of ecologically sensitive resources and the need to maintain and protect environmental amenities and features of a site the foremost factor to consider when developing property is the land the first step is to identify all natural resources floodplain wetlands lakes ponds channels and other water bodies steep slopes mature and young woodlands and significant trees meadows and prairies and soil types that are present on the site significant vistas and scenic areas that are present on the property and worthy of preservation should also be identified this step will provide an indication of areas that are free of sensitive natural resources and other significant features where building and development activity should occur on a property the mchenry county soil and water conservation service maintains information that may be used initially to identify the natural resources and conservation areas at the preapplication stage of the subdivision approval process the second step is locating building sites once natural and conservation areas are identified building sites should be located to take advantage of open space and scenic views smaller lot areas and smaller lot widths which maximize the number of lots facing natural and conservation areas should be considered in order to provide more efficient use of the usable land after open space and conservation lands have been identified and building locations established the third step is to design the street and circulation network to provide access to building sites and to allow movement throughout the subdivision the street layout should avoid sensitive natural resources such as wetlands woodlands significant tree stands and wildlife habitats and should be designed to take advantage of open space vistas interconnection of internal streets and street connections to adjoining lands should be provided to create opportunities for future connectivity the fourth step after conservation areas are identified building sites established and streets located is to establish lot lines a mix of building styles and uses will allow for flexible lot sizes and design and enable a subdivision to take maximum advantage of conservation subdivision concepts the fifth and final step in this process is to determine how each building site can be served by essential public utilities this may require innovation on the part of the engineering professional in order to provide utility service while protecting natural resources and amenities additional information regarding the protection and preservation of natural resources can be found in conservation design standards and regulations and exhibit i conservation subdivision

into the city shall automatically be classified in the ag district until such time as rezoned by the city council 7a2 district descriptions a agriculture district the ag agriculture zoning district permits land use activity that is compatible with existing rural character and agricultural uses while not permanently preventing future development options when population growth or other forces establishes a need or desire on the part of the city to unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  a4 convert land from the ag designation to a higher intensity zoning classification these areas may be rezoned to permit more intensive uses residential dwellings home occupations and low intensity agricultural activity including but not limited to the preparation cultivation andor sale of ornamental floral arrangements seeds and greenhouse products are permitted on tracts that meet the standards of this zoning district or where a special use permit has been approved commentary intensive agricultural uses are most suitable outside the city of woodstock where land parcels are large enough to accommodate farming and the raising of livestock where the risk of coming into conflict with urban land activity is minimal and where the need for municipal water and sanitary sewer services does not exist or where the provision of such services is impractical in some instances the ag zoning designation serves as a means of placing development activity on hold until such time as the city determines a more appropriate zoning designation and permanent use b estate district the e estate zoning district provides areas for lowdensity larger residential home sites with a maximum of one dwelling unit per acre properties zoned e should include only those tracts that abut or are in close proximity to existing largelot single family development and may also be appropriate for areas where topography or natural features make conventional urban development difficult or impractical tracts with an e zoning designation may serve as an appropriate transition between rural agricultural and urban uses the creation of unique development sites is encouraged on such land especially when it is characterized by topographic diversity woodlands wetlands and other environmental amenities and resources the e district is expected to provide land for only a small amount of

than 24 apartment dwelling units f neighborhood business district business establishments in the b1 zoning district are intended to serve the immediate needs of the surrounding neighborhood and to accommodate neighborhood oriented lowintensity retail sales and service uses the b1 zoning designation is appropriate in existing residential neighborhoods and for new residential developments that include a mixeduse component g general business district and central business district the b2 zoning district is intended to provide the widest variety of goods services and mercantile functions within the city the b2c zoning district is also intended to provide this same variety in the area typically identified as woodstocks downtown while providing this variety in such a way that land uses are easily accessible by walking and compatible with both public and private parking facilities the b2c district seeks to protect preserve and enhance historic and architectural character conserve the value of buildings and encourage appropriate use of land in the downtown this district acknowledges that woodstocks downtown contributes significantly to the citys overall image  that the economic vitality of the downtown is important to the overall welfare of the city  that the proper use of property in the downtown will offer social and cultural benefits to the citizens of woodstock  that a diversity of business office institutional park and residential uses is desirable and appropriate in the core area of the city  that standards and criteria which encourage new buildings retain the values of surrounding land parcels and protect the citys traditional character will promote good urban design  and that the encouragement of development within walking distance of the train depot and at sufficient densities that will support the station and downtown businesses is a wise use of land h service & retail district the b3 zoning district allows for the establishment of a variety of

in some instances may be detrimental to the planning goals and objectives of a community in regard to conservation design best management practices refers to a combination of conservation measures structures or management efforts that reduces or avoids adverse effects of development on a site on adjoining land and on waterways and water bodies best management practices are used to control soil loss and enhance water quality to minimize impacts to surface water and groundwater resources to improve water circulation patterns and to reduce negative impacts to the chemical physical and biological characteristics of wetlands the application of best management practices should be used whenever possible to achieve the citys development goals and objectives examples of best management

review and building permit review process the conservation design approach may be applied to a portion of a development site and it can be used or combined with other approaches to land development such as a traditional neighborhood development 8b3 conservation development site design the primary factor in determining acceptable site design is the land and its underlying characteristics proposed development shall be designed to fit the topography physical features and soil conditions of the subject site site design that recognizes natural drainage patterns the use and preservation of native vegetation and the stabilization of soils during construction and which protects enhances and maintains natural resources is encouraged the general steps indicated below shall be followed when designing the layout and arrangement of a development site additional information about the conservation design process including visual renderings prepared for each phase in the conservation design process can be found in exhibit i a the first step is to identify all natural resources conservation areas open space areas and physical features floodplain wetlands lakes ponds channels and other water bodies steep slopes mature and young woodlands and significant trees meadows and prairies and soil types on the site significant vistas and scenic areas that are present on the property and worthy of preservation shall also be identified these features shall be preserved and protected from any negative impacts generated as a result of the development or other land disturbing activities b the second step is to locate building sites once natural resources and conservation areas are identified building sites should be located to take advantage of open space and scenic views smaller lot areas and smaller lot widths which maximize the number of lots abutting natural resources and conservation areas should be considered in order to provide more efficient use of the land as well as to protect the development rights of the property owner and the number of occupancy units permitted by the underlying zoning of the property c the third step is to design the street and circulation necessary to provide access to building sites and to allow movement throughout the subdivision and onto adjoining lands the street layout should avoid sensitive natural resources such as wetlands woodlands significant tree stands and wildlife habitats and should be designed to take advantage of open space vistas interconnection of internal streets and street connections to adjoining land parcels should be provided to create opportunities for future connectivity unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  b5 commentary the following illustrations provide a comparison of a conventional subdivision design and a conservation development approach to development conventional subdivision design conservation subdivision design same number of building sites and increased open space from growing greener  a conservation planning workbook for municipal officials in pennsylvania pa department of conservation and natural resources october 1998design unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  b6 d the fourth step is to establish lot lines and lot sizes in order to take maximum advantage of conservation subdivision concepts this step creates individual building lots and allows ownership of said lots to be transferred from one land owner to the next e a fifth and final step which is separate from the initial conservation design approach but which is required for all development proposals in the city is to prepare engineering plans which indicate how each building site can be served by essential public utilities while at the same time acknowledging the need to preserve and protect the environmental resources on a site this may require innovation on the part of the engineering professional in order to provide utility service while protecting natural resources and amenities 8b4 permissible and prohibited activities a permissible activities are those in accordance with the purposes of this part of the review and approval process for a conservation

illinois  page a17 appendix h statement on natural landscaping natural landscaping is the design construction and maintenance of landscapes that provide beneficial natural functions which are typically lost installation of conventional lawns or agriculture natural landscaping stresses the preservation and reintroduction of plants native to the woodstock and northern illinois area native plants are hardy and attractive and can be used to stabilize soil reduce flooding absorb pollutants and sustain wildlife within the city of woodstock the use of natural plant materials for landscaping is encouraged the city recognizes the importance of the preserving and restoring natural plant communities and places significant emphasis on the protection and enhancement of these communities within woodstocks boundaries when new development is proposed the establishment of native plant species is recommended for placement in drainage swales at the perimeter of detention basins within areas designated for and reserved as open space within buffer and transitional areas between different uses and at the edge of streams lakes and wetlands the establishment of natural areas must include short and long term management for both routine and remedial maintenance the maintenance responsibility should be set forth as part of an agreement between the property owner or the homeowners association and the city so that the city has a record of who is responsible for such maintenance such an agreement should be a condition of development approval among the approaches to managing natural areas are o natural areas may be dedicated to the city or other public agency such as the mchenry county conservation district o a homeowners association may take possession of the natural area and assume responsibility for its maintenance o a conservation easement may be granted to the city or other governmental agency or to a notforprofit group whose primary purpose is to maintain the natural area o the owner may continue to own the natural area in order to facilitate the maintenance of natural areas the city may use a special service area ssa which provides funding if the owning entity is unable to properly manage the natural area over time additional information on natural landscaping and its long term ownership and maintenance can be found in unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a18 appendix i conservation subdivision design unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a19 subdivisions where the street system is the first thing to be identified followed by lot lines fanning out to encompass every square foot of ground into houselots when municipalities require nothing more than houselots and streets that is all they receive but by setting community standards higher and requiring 50 to 70 percent open space as a precondition for achieving full density officials can effectively encourage conservation subdivision design the protected land in each new subdivision would then become building blocks that add new acreage to communitywide networks of interconnected open space each time a property is developed from growing greener  putting conservation into local codes natural lands trust inc november 199 wwwnatlandsorg unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a20 appendix j conservation concepts for development and general principles of soil erosion and sediment control a  conservation concepts for development  encourage common open space a common area without property lines and managed by professionals contracted by a homeowners association common areas may also protect rivers lakes streams wetlands wildlife and water quality  surface and groundwater quality minimize impacts of runoff by using best management practices bmps such as buffers vegetated swales instead of curb and gutter constructed wetlands and wetland bottom detention to improve the quality of runoff and protect environmentally sensitive areas wetlands rivers streams  groundwater quantity reduce impervious areas in groundwater recharge soils i order to maximize infiltration  maintain existing vegetation throughout the development process bmps such as eliminating mass grading protecting existing trees wooded fence rows and odd areas vegetated hillsides and wetlands contribute to the maintenance of existing vegetative resources  permanently stabilize all cropland going to development bmps such as permanent or temporary vegetative cover as well as the use of perennial grasses and legumes provide a filter for erosion wildlife habitat during development and stabilize the highly erodible land from the erosive forces of rainfall  permanently stabilize all stormwater and drainage conveyance easements prior to their use  plan for the establishment of native vegetation in all common areas drainage areas and conservation areas utilize native vegetation that improves biological diversity for water quality and wildlife habitat and prohibits the use of fertilizers pesticides and mowing  minimize disturbance of sensitive highly erodible soils this helps to preserve the hydrologic condition of the soil profile and improve permeability and infiltration that promotes groundwater recharge  restore existing vegetation the restoration of native vegetation improves wildlife habitat stormwater runoff and water quality  maintenance maintain all land for long term benefits  use buffers buffers provide esthetic amenities and also water quality and natural resource protection  eliminate stormwater detention drainage into agriculture drain tiles  erosion and sediment control plan highly erodible soils require a wellplanned and implemented erosion control and sedimentation control plan utilizing the above referenced bmps unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a21 b general principles of soil erosion and sediment control  plan the development to fit the particular topography soils drainage patterns and natural vegetation of the site  preserve and protect areas of natural vegetation on the site  take special precautions to prevent damage which could result from development activity adjacent to watercourses lakes and wetlands  minimize the extent and duration of the area exposed at one time  apply temporary erosion control practices as soon as possible to stabilize exposed soils and prevent onsite damage  install sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and perimeter control practices prior to site clearing and grading to protect disturbed areas from offsite and onsite runoff and to prevent sediment damage to areas located down slope of the development site  keep runoff velocities low and provide for retention of runoff on the site  provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways  implement final grading and install permanent vegetation on disturbed areas as soon as possible  implement maintenance and followup program from mchenry county soil & water conservation district unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a22 appendix ja performance standards for restoration planting maintenance and monitoring of natural open space and naturalized stormwater management facilities the requirements listed below apply to puds subdivisions and conservation design developments involving the creation of natural and naturalized open space areas their purpose is to ensure that the overall design intent for these areas including existing open spaces prairies wetdetention basins drainage swales and buffers is achieved and maintained particularly during the initial plant establishment phase such areas are intended to provide an aesthetic healthy diverse community of native vegetation to meet the objectives of soil stabilization stormwater treatment and wildlife habitat this is accomplished by complying with the following requirements 1 the development and implementation of a landscapeplantingmonitoring and maintenance plan 2 routine monitoring of planting success 3 followup repair reseeding andor replanting to meet performance criteria 4 preparation of three annual reports summarizing monitoring data documenting maintenance and remedial activities in comparison to stated performance criteria 5 preparation of a long term monitoring and management to maintain the areas in perpetuity 6 evaluation of performance standards at the end of the threeyear monitoring and management period and required long term monitoring and management provisions monitoring is required annually for a minimum of three full growing seasons following planting under circumstances where the minimum performance standards cannot be achieved alternative performance standards must be presented to the city for approval the establishment of native prairie and wetland vegetation within any pud subdivision or conservation development shall be carefully planned and executed to ensure long term success native planting efforts should be considered on an equal footing with other major infrastructure improvements of a development such as roads public utilities and building standards without performance standards open space restoration and native plant establishment is likely to fail in many circumstances leaving future home owner associations or the city with major management problems that they may not have the expertise or resources to address therefore it is important to provide reasonable performance standards to regulate the planning establishment and monitoring success of native plantings within developments 1 landscapeplanting plan a site specific landscapeplanting plan shall be submitted to the city with required site or final engineering plans the plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional in the field of natural resources and who is acceptable to the city at a minimum the plan shall include  a map drawn to scale and depicting all proposed planting areas proposed management units should rely heavily on soil types topography and hydrology management unit mapping will also show the overall layout of the development to demonstrate that naturalized areas are adequately setback from homes and other infrastructure so that the potential for fire hazard during controlled or accidental burns unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a23 is reduced if applicable fire breaks including those in the form of of mowed paths should also be identified  a list all plants seeds andor plugs to be used within each management unit all plantings will consist of species native to mchenry county of a local genotype and appropriate for the proposed habitat the number of plants and plugs to be used and the amountweight of seed per species shall also be included along with seeding rates per acre for each species  a threeyear management schedule which includes proposed timing and description of the following site preparation application of herbicides seeding activity mowing controlled burns and similar activities areas restored to native communities should be protected by silt fencing or construction fencing to prevent unnecessary disruption or destruction due to nearby construction activity 2 plant monitoring the following tasks shall be performed within each management unit identified in the landscapeplanting plan during the first 3 years  plant inventory of all naturally landscaped areas this inventory shall determine overall vegetative cover the total number of species and the prevalence of undesirableinvasive species consistent with specified performance criteria this inventory is used to determine where followup seeding or planting is needed and to identify locate and remove undesirable weedy species on a timely basis permanent transect vegetation sampling techniques should be used within each management unit to adequately document and monitor plant community establishment over the initial 3 year period the presence of any plant species observed outside of a transect and not documented by sampling along such transect shall also be noted sampling techniques and summaries shall be compiled consistent with methods described in plants of the chicago region by floyd swink and gerould wilhelm  establishment of permanent photographic monitoring locations photographs will be taken to document the establishment of vegetative cover erosion problems and other relevant maintenance concerns within each management unit identified in the landscapeplanting plan photographs must be of satisfactory quality and resolution to accomplish the intent of the performance standards and shall be taken from the same locations during each monitoring event a detailed description of the cameraphoto location based on distance from a permanent structure the orientation of the photo and the vegetation zone being photographed shall be provided additional photos should be taken of problem areas and remedial activities 3 performance criteria in order to ensure adequate diversity of plants to respond to varying environmental and hydrologic conditions to ensure the establishment of native landscapes that are functional aesthetic and costeffective and to provide reasonable variety to meet aesthetic expectations a minimum of 10 species of native plants are required within any naturalized stormwater facility such as wetland detention basins or swales a minimum of 40 native species will be established in any upland prairie recreations the success of natural landscaping can be affected by the appropriateness of the plant species selected the effectiveness of the grading and installation of stormwater management basins and swales the quality of the plant material used and attention to early maintenance with upland prairie recreations it is appropriate to leave soils undisturbed since mass grading will result in compacted soils and may lead to serious weed problems land currently under agricultural row crop production should remain unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a24 undisturbed if possible until prairie seeding can be accomplished this will contribute to the success of the native landscape by preventing the establishment of weeds and minimizing the corruption of the seed bank the success of the project will be formally evaluated by the following vegetation performance standards monitored over time  by the end of the first full growing season upland planted areas should have 90 percent vegetation cover and no upland area greater than 10 meter square shall be devoid of vegetation a cover crop of annual rye or oats may be used to help achieve this goal if an area is designed as an aquatic or emergent system it is anticipated that portions of the submerged area will be periodically exposed and without vegetation cover due to fluctuating water levels if by the end of the first full growing season the basin emergent zones andor side slopes fail to support the establishment of sufficient vegetation then corrective measures regarding the fundamental design of the area andor planting plan shall be required at least 75 percent of the plugs root stock and tubers and 90 percent of the seeded species should be present and alive  during the second growing season at least 60 percent of the permanent species planted in seed form should be evident ninety percent or more of species planted as plugs root stock and tubers shall also have persisted into the second season if this fails to occur a determination must be made as to why and remedial action shall be necessary remediation may include overseeding andor plugging of appropriate species finally undesirable invasive plant species shall not be prevalent in any of the management units specifically none of the following shall be among the five most dominant plant species in the overall vegetative cover  reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea  common reed phragmites australis  purple loosestrife lythrum salicaria  nonnative thistle cirsium spp carduus spp  sweet clover melilotus spp  crown vetch coronilla varia  wild parsnip pastinaca sativa  garlic mustard alliaria petiolata  teasel dipsacus spp  ragweed ambrosia spp  kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis  buckthorn rhamnus spp  sandbar willow salix interior  honeysuckle lonicera spp  multiflora rose rosa multiflora  box elder acer negundo  at the end of the third full growing season at least 75 percent of the seeded permanent species and 90 percent or more of species planted as plugs root stock and tubers are expected to be established alternatively native perennial species that volunteer on the site excluding undesirable invasive species may also be counted in determining the preceding criteria qualitative vegetative sampling within each management area shall achieve the following to be determined a success and a mean coefficient of conservatism shall meet or exceed 3 and the floristic quality index shall meet or exceed 20 swink and wilhelm the five most dominant species of the overall vegetative cover within each management unit shall not include any of the undesirable species listed above under the 2nd season performance unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a25 standards if the identified level of species development fails to occur a determination must be made as to why and a remedial action plan must be prepared and submitted to the city for approval the approved remedial plan must be implemented and continued monitoring will be required beyond the third growing season until these performance criteria are met where the minimum performance standards cannot be achieved a written explanation and alternative performance standards must be approved by the city 4 annual reporting an annual monitoring report shall be submitted to the city and shall include the following  a summary of vegetation data collected within each management unit including an assessment of compliance with performance criteria  a description of vegetation maintenance activities including overseeding replanting and control of undesirable weedy species and an assessment of their effectiveness in meeting performance criteria  photographs and accompanying descriptions taken at permanent monitoring stations  a summary of planned maintenance activities for the coming year 5 long term monitoring and management plan  continued maintenance shall be provided to maintain a diverse native plant community consistent with performance criteria to minimize the proliferation of weeds and undesired woody vegetation and to prevent erosion long term maintenance should consist of control burn management every one to three years as required by site conditions to maintain the established native plant communities minimal spot control and application of herbicides may be necessary  long term maintenance shall include the removal of trash or debris and the removal of obstructions from basin outlet structures periodic removal of accumulated sediment from swales forebays and settling basins shall be done to maintain the function and aesthetics of stormwater facilities at a minimum sediment shall be removed from forebays and sediment basins when 1 or more feet of sediment has accumulated 6 sign off and acceptance final approval and release of improvement guarantees shall not occur until a final inspection by the city verifies that performance criteria have been met when the performance standards have been met the city shall allow the areas to be placed under the control of an approved conservation organization or homeowners association to implement the long term management of the natural areas in the event that conditions of performance criteria cannot be met an alternative plan shall be prepared or a feeinlieu of payment to be determined by the city may be used to meet performance criteria standards unified development edition city of woodstock illinois  page a26 appendix k sample rezoningspecial use permit petition in the matter of the
