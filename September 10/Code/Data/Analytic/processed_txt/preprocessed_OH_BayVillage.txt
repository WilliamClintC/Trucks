perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing  2 the person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense b when the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c 1 when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2 c1 of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the traffic 3 c1 of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition incorporated into the offense d voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a

drug or alcohol and a drug orc 290121 50108  culpable mental states a a person acts purposely when it is the persons specific intention to cause a certain result or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature b a person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact c a person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist d a person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the persons conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature a person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist e when the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element orc 290122 50109  attempt a no person purposely or knowingly and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient

the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth e it is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense the actor terminated his complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose f whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender a charge of

appears c in a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed it is a defense that the high managerial officer agent or employee having supervisory

specific location in which the use is proposed such monitoring is necessary because the external impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in advance and therefore may vary from site to site making it possible that without the planning commissions review a particular use could be inappropriate in a certain location within the district b these regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner while safeguarding the property rights of all individuals and the health safety and general welfare of the community toward these ends it is recognized that this zoning provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in a specific district with respect to such considerations as
