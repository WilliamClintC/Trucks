ecigarillos epipes ehookahs electronic nicotine delivery systems etc are electric or battery operated devices designed to deliver nicotine flavor andor other substances vapor inhaled by the user 14 the use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years 15 more than one study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vaping 16 some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine 17 electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products 18 the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made accordingly the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this section are 1 to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment  and 2 to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke 11101 22106   10714 definitions the

of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which he is physically capable of performing if that conduct is all that is required for commission of a particular offense or if an offense or some material element thereof does not require a culpable mental state on the part of the actor the offense is one of strict liability if a culpable mental state on the part of the actor is required with respect to any material element of an offense the offense is one of mental culpability state law reference similar provisions ala  13a23 construction with respect to culpability requirements a when a statute or ordinance defining an offense prescribes as an element thereof a specified culpable mental state such mental state is presumed to apply to every element of the offense unless the context thereof indicates to the contrary b although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute or ordinance defining an offense an appropriate culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such culpable mental state a statute or ordinance defining a crime unless clearly indicating a legislative intent to impose strict liability states a crime of mental culpability c if a statute or ordinance provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense that element also is established if a person acts recklessly knowingly or intentionally if recklessness suffices to establish an element that element also is established if a person acts knowingly and intentionally if acting knowingly suffices to establish an element that element also is established if a person acts intentionally state law reference similar provisions ala  13a24 casual relationship between conduct and results  relationship to mental culpability a a person is criminally liable if the result would not have occurred but for his conduct operating either alone or concurrently with another cause unless the concurrent cause was sufficient to produce the result and the conduct of the actor clearly insufficient b a person is nevertheless criminally liable for causing a result if the only difference between that which actually occurred and what he intended contemplated or risked is that 1 a different person or property was injured harmed or affected  or 2 a less serious or less extensive injury or harm occurred c when causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law the element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actors conduct state law reference similar provisions ala  13a25 effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability a a person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in that conduct under a mistaken belief of fact unless 1 his factual mistake negatives the culpable mental state required for the commission of an offense  or 2 the statute or ordinance defining the offense or a statute or ordinance related thereto expressly provides that such a factual mistake constitutes a defense or exemption  or 3 the factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification as defined in this chapter b a person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in that conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not as a matter of law constitute an offense unless his mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in a statute or the latest judicial decision of the highest state or federal court which has decided on the matter c the burden of injecting the issue of mistake of law under subsection b of this section is on the defendant but this does not shift the burden of proof d a mistake of law other than as to the existence or meaning of the statute or ordinance under which the defendant is prosecuted is relevant to disprove the specific state of mental culpability required by the statute or ordinance under which the defendant is prosecuted state law reference similar provisions ala  13a26 consent a the consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense if such consent negatives a required element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense b when conduct is charged to constitute an offense because it causes or threatens bodily harm consent to such conduct or to the infliction of such harm is a defense only if 1 the bodily harm consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not serious  or 2 the conduct and the harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport  or 3 the consent establishes a justification for the conduct under this chapter c unless otherwise provided by this chapter or by the law defining the offense assent does not constitute consent if 1 it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct  or 2 it is given by a person who by reason of immaturity mental disease or defect or intoxication is manifestly unable and known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct  or 3 it is given by a person whose consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense  or 4 it is induced by force duress or deception state law reference similar

lacks capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law d intoxication in itself does not constitute mental disease or defect within the

development except duplexes adjacent to or abutting a residential zoning district a buffer strip along the property lines of the developing property is required the buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot lines the type of buffer may consist of any or all of the following see residential buffer options in the appendix a an opaque fence not less than six 6 feet in height with

credits in order to encourage the preservation of opelikas older trees certain requirements relating to the number and density of new trees may be waived in the event existing trees are preserved a for each existing significant tree with a dbh between six 6 inches and ten 10 inches fifteen 15 fewer points are required for each existing significant tree between i l and twentyfour 24 inches twenty 20 fewer points are required for each existing significant tree with a dbh over twentyfour 24 inches twentyfive 25 fewer points are required however precautions must be taken during construction to prevent damage to the existing trees and any tree that dies during or because of construction must be replaced with a similar species or species approved by the city horticulturist to equal lost tree points eg an oak with a dbh of twentyfive 25 inches is claimed as an existing tree but subsequently dies the developer must replace the tree with tree plantings which exceed 25 points b trees for which an ownerdeveloper wishes to receive credit must be in the developed area and cannot be in undeveloped portions of the parcel this stipulation prevents a developer with a large tract of land from claiming credit on portions left undeveloped and thus eliminating landscaping on the developed portion of the parcel maintenance the owner is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of planted trees in perpetuity within hisher development after all plantings are finalized the developer will schedule an inspection of the plantings with the city horticulturist and landscape installer if all plantings appear to be in good condition the city horticulturist will issue a certificate of completion to the developer and building official if plantings are subsequently damaged in poor condition diseased or dead the city horticulturist may require the property owner to replace the plantings and bring the lot back into compliance failure to bring the lot into compliance could lead to the city
