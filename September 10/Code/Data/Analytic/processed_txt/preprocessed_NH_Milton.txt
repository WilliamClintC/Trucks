article xiii wetland conservation ordinance adopted  these regulations are intended to 1 control and regulate the development of structures and of land use on jurisdictionally occurring wetlands which could contribute if uncontrolled to pollution of surface and ground water by wastewater or septic systems or toxic substances 2 prevent unnecessary or excessive expense to the town in providing and maintaining essential services and utilities as a result of inharmonious use of wetlands 3 prevent the destruction of natural wetlands which provide flood protection and water storage provide recharge of groundwater supply and provide augmentation of stream flow during dry periods 4 encourage those uses that can be appropriately and safely located in wetland areas 5 protect presently existing natural wetland wildlife habitats 6 prevent damage to abutters structures and properties a description 1 a wetland also see wetlands and wetlands buffers definitions in of the milton zoning  is hereby determined to be an area which would be delineated as a wetland using the methodology required by the state of new hampshire department of environmental service wetlands bureau surface waters and including the buffer requirements of section h of this department of environmental service wetlands bureau requires wetlands to be delineated using a combination of the corps of engineers wetlands delineation manual technical report y871 environmental laboratory department of the army 1987 and the field indicators for identifying hydric soils in new england version 2 new england interstate water pollution control commission 1998 as of the writing of this approved wetlands delineation methodology uses three parameters hydric soils hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology the precise location of a wetland boundary in any particular case shall be determined by onsite inspection of soil types and vegetation by a certified wetland scientist using the methodology required by the new hampshire department of environmental service wetlands bureau 2 in all cases where the rules of this from those of the underlying zoning district in the town of milton any conflict between such regulations shall be resolved by applying the morerestrictive regulation 3 areas to be excluded from this a where the wetland or surface water is an isolated wetland smaller than three thousand 3000 sq feet  b the wetland or surface water is a vegetated swale or roadside ditch a sedimentationdetention basin an agriculturalirrigation pond a septage lagoon or a wetland on converted cropland b purpose  the purpose of this to protect the public health safety and general welfare by controlling and guiding the use of land areas which have been found to be subjected to high water tables for extended periods of time wetlands are a critical natural resource which effect water quality flooding wildlife recreation and aesthetics and their protection is a goal of the master plan wetlands protect surface water quality by reducing the velocity of surface water runoff allowing for the deposit of sediment and 38 nutrients wetlands protect shorelines from erosion wetlands absorb water during times of flooding thus helping to reduce floodwater elevations wetlands help to maintain the quality of groundwater recharge wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including fish birds deer and other animals wetlands contribute to a broad range of recreational opportunities including canoeing hunting fishing and bird watching wetlands contribute to the aesthetic values of the town providing open space natural vistas landform contrasts and early autumn foliage these purposes in combination with the fact that wetlands are often ill suited to development activities  demonstrate why the long term protection of wetlands contributes greatly to the welfare of the community the publication buffers for wetlands and surface waters chase deming and latawiec revised may 1997 recommends that buffers around wetlands also be protected since unbuffered wetlands may not be able to adequately fulfill their functions the guidebook defines buffers as a naturally vegetated upland area adjacent to a wetland or surface water in this definition naturally vegetated includes the following uncut or undisturbed forest minimally disturbed or managed forest and abandoned pasture or fields c permitted uses within the naturally vegetated buffer  permitted uses shall be as follows 1 any use that does not involve the erection of a structure or does not alter the surface

approvals shall occur as set forth in these subdivision regulations for approved phased developments the deadlines for each phase as stated in the approved phasing schedule shall be substituted for the twoyear limitation period set forth above any request for an extension of time for a particular phase as described in of these regulations shall only apply to the particular phase and such extension shall not automatically apply to any later phases of the development 713 phased development the board may require or an applicant may request permission for construction of the proposed subdivision in phases if the board requires or permits phased development the review and approval procedure shall be as follows a for purposes of these regulations phased development shall mean a project which is approved to be constructed in phases over a total period of time which may be in excess of the time limits set forth in 6 of these regulations or those in rsa  phased development may also include a project for which the planning board has imposed a phasing requirement in order to mitigate the impact of a development on community facilities services or utilities 17 if the board requires or permits phased development the development shall be b reviewed and approved as a whole under these regulations and shall be treated as a whole for purposes of applying all development review standards criteria and submission requirements the applicant shall submit with the application a proposed phasing schedule c which if approved by the board shall be included as part of any

particular phase shall not be considered final under rsa ii nor shall any plan of that phase be recorded in the strafford county registry of deeds until the security for the improvements which are part of that phase has been properly posted with the town or until such required improvements have been completed inspected and approved by the town d in determining whether to grant an applicants request for phased development or to approve a proposed phasing schedule the board may consider the totality of the circumstances including but not limited to the following factors 1 the extent to which review of the development in its totality is logical and reasonable due to the degree to which the proposed phases are wellintegrated both as to their use and development scheme and as to common infrastructure and other improvements by contrast with a series of superficiallyrelated projects which could just as effectively be reviewed individually  2 the degree to which the integration of the phases as described above would make private investment in such improvements unlikely without the predictability of a phased approval 3 the extent to which phasing will benefit the town by mitigating and making more predictable the impacts of the complete development upon community facilities services utilities and other town goals as set forth in the master plan 18 4 the extent to which the proposed phasing schedule represents a realistic timeline for active and substantial development progressing at a steady pace considering the type and complexity of the project as a whole rather than an attempt to maintain vesting during significant periods of nondevelopment  5 the total length of time proposed and the degree of unpredictability or board uncertainty involved with respect to whether a later phase or phases will continue to meet current regulations at the time of construction and considering potential changed conditions which might occur in the meantime within the neighborhood or the town as a whole e prior to recording the final plat for each later phase the applicant shall submit to the town planner or officer a copy of the final plat the planner or shall then determine whether the development is in accordance with the approved phasing schedule and whether required security for that phase has been provided to the town if the development is proceeding in accordance with the approved phasing schedule the later phases shall be presumed to be vested against changes in town land use ordinances and regulations except as otherwise specified by the board as part of its approval however the town planner or officer may determine that due to specific circumstances including but not limited to noncompliance with applicable regulations or conditions of approval a later phase or phases should not be considered vested under rsa  or the new hampshire common law of vested rights in such a case the town planner or officer may forward to the planning board a recommendation to initiate proceedings using the procedures of rsa a as applicable to revoke approval of a phase or phases f if the applicant anticipates being unable to meet any time deadlines set forth in the approved phasing schedule with respect to any phase he or she may apply to the planning board for an extension of up to two 2 years for the particular phase pursuant to of these regulations the request for an extension shall be submitted to the land use office prior to the expiration of the deadlines involved if the applicant fails to meet any such deadline or extension thereof then the approval of that phase and any subsequent phases shall be considered void and such phases shall no longer be presumed vested however the applicant may resubmit the application for such phases to the board for further review and reapproval considering changes in ordinances regulations or other material circumstances which have occurred in the town since the original approval 714 permission to visit property a for the town to effectively and efficiently review development applications town staff and members of the planning board must have the ability to enter a property that is the subject of an application b submission of an application for minor subdivision or design review or final plat review of a major subdivision shall be deemed as the granting of permission for

waiver of regulations upon written request from the applicant the planning board may at its discretion waive or modify any part of these regulations other than those regulations required by state law the basis for any such waiver or modification granted by the board shall be recorded in the minutes of the board the board may only grant a waiver or modification of these regulations if the board finds by majority vote that a strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations  or b specific circumstances relative to the subdivision or conditions of the land in such subdivision indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations all written requests for waiver or modifications of these regulations shall address items a andor b above depending on which criteria are being relied upon to justify the request for waivers from a submission requirement

have been met if during its review the planning board determines that the waived information is necessary to complete its review then the applicant shall provide that information minor lot line
