of a billboard that is nonconforming due to location in the cbd a natural area or a historic district ii four points per sign face for the removal of any other nonconforming billboard iii three points per sign face for the removal of a conforming billboard that is capable in its existing structural condition of safely supporting a multiple message sign of the same area as the existing sign face iv two points per sign face for the removal of any other existing billboard that is not capable in its existing structural condition of safely supporting a multiple message sign of the same area as the existing sign face v one additional point per sign face for the removal of a billboard visible from a street or highway with a functional classification of interstate freeway or principal arterial vii no points are awarded for the replacement of an existing billboard while a digital billboard may be approved where an existing static sign has been removed from a conforming location this sign removal does not count toward the required mitigation points the points must be obtained from other sign sites b a mitigation plan shall be submitted for review by the planning department and more than one new multiple message sign may be included in a single mitigation plan the cumulative points earned for sign removal may be applied to multiple signs within a single mitigation plan and sign permit application however any excess points remaining are not carried over or banked for future applications in other words mitigation points will not be tracked beyond a single sign project which may involve multiple new signs the reason for this is to avoid conflicts between mitigation points and the existing cap on the total number of allowable offpremise signs c if the cumulative result of a sign project and mitigation plan is a net reduction in signs then the maximum allowable number of offpremise signs for the city as a whole will be reduced immediately this means that signs removed under a mitigation plan can only be replaced with the multiple message signs being mitigated they cannot be replaced with other signs in the future d relocating an existing multiple message sign from one location to another within the city shall not require a mitigation plan provided that such relocation does not result in an increase in the overall number of sign faces or structures whether static or multiple message located in the city in lieu of a mitigation plan the applicant shall remove three existing billboard sign faces under the current billboard inventory as required in subsection j a conditional use permit is nevertheless required for the relocation or replacement of a billboard sign 3 permitted locations of multiple message signs a sign message must be directed to

reserved subchapter   special purpose districts division 1  general provisions purpose special purpose districts are established to address planning and land use issues and opportunities that go beyond the general purposes of the citys conventional zoning districts they are narrowly constructed for the special purposes and unique circumstances defined in the purpose statement for each district and are only to be applied to the unique areas of the city that align with the stated purpose and siting criteria the special purpose districts are as follows a the special purposeresidential light industrial srli district is a mixeduse district meaning that it is intended to encourage a mix of compatible land uses in a variety of locations and scales in order to preserve and enhance the vitality of the neighborhood the overall intent for land uses in the srli district is to allow the continuation and limited expansion of existing single and two family residential uses to allow the addition of attached or accessory residential uses livework unit dwelling in conjunction with a business etc where they enhance the vitality of a commercial or industrial use to allow very limited new residential uses and to allow a carefully selected set of commercial and light industrial uses that will be compatible with the existing and anticipated housing in the area other compatible uses may also be allowed where they are consistent with the overall purpose of the district because of the wide range of uses particular to the srli mixeduse district careful site design and adherence to the applicable land use performance standards refer to subchapter  division 9 are especially important the srli district is not an overlay zone but rather completely replaces the underlying zoning where it is adopted overlay zones could then be applied in addition to the srli district 1 siting criteria the srli district may be applied to neighborhoods with the following characteristics a a wide array of land uses from singlefamily residential to commercial and light industrial intermixed within close proximity to each other b close proximity to an intensive industrial or manufacturing area imparting to the mixeduse neighborhood significant potential for commercial and industrial redevelopment over the long term c signs of decline at the time of rezoning which might include blighted properties increased crime decreased owneroccupancy and the like that need to be immediately addressed for reasons of protecting public health safety and welfare and for stabilizing property values d very old housing stock much of which predates zoning but with a substantial proportion that has been wellmaintained e geographic isolation due to natural features and transportation corridors such as arterial streets and railroads which limit to some extent service provision and amenities 2 in addition the purpose of the srli district is a to be applied as an intermediate measure due to the nearterm infeasibility of public redevelopment while redevelopment for commercial and light industrial uses remains as the long range plan public funding is not available in the foreseeable future certain features of this district are intended to preserve the ability to allow for such redevelopment should it become feasible in the future while not penalizing the property owners that wish to continue using existing properties b to encourage home ownership and owneroccupancy by making existing one and twofamily residential properties conforming uses that can be maintained and rebuilt subject to the requirements of this subchapter and in some cases expanded however the srli district does not affect the floodplain zoning refer to subchapter  that may also apply structures and uses in the srli district that are nonconforming due to the presence of floodplain must comply with the applicable floodplain zoning regulations c to encourage and preserve commercial and light industrial redevelopment as a long term strategy by limiting new residential construction and by recognizing the right of commercial and industrial uses to operate within the established land use performance standards for glare heat vibration noise odor air quality explosionfire hazard waste discharge and pollution d to support the vitality of the neighborhood by allowing for quality affordable housing to be located within walking distance of employment opportunities e to encourage innovative site and building design that allows for a unique mix of land uses in a way that does not lead to land use conflicts  principal uses for the special purpose districts a in general table 211 principal uses in the special purpose districts lists all permitted and conditional uses allowed in the special

late and early hours of operation and the like the conditions described may occur as a result of any industrial operation which is in conformance with accepted customs standards laws and regulations residents in areas zoned srli should be prepared to accept such conditions as a normal and necessary aspect of living in an area with a history of industrial land uses and an active industrial sector

concurrently with rehabilitation and improvements that will bring the entire structure into code compliance and a condition of good repair c definition and standards for new residential uses 1 new residential use shall be defined as any of the following a construction of a dwelling regardless of the type where the parcel had been vacant prior to  effective date of this ordinance b construction

than 12 months has not been subject to a raze order issued by the city and can be modified repaired or reconstructed in compliance with all other applicable codes and ordinances 3 new residential uses may only be granted a conditional use if the plan commission and city council find that a the residential use is located in a predominantly residential area b the residential use will not adversely affect commercial and industrial uses in the area c the residential use will not be subject to excessive noise smoke dust noxious odor toxic materials safety hazards or other adverse impacts from

obscure the architectural features of the principal building and shall be designed to be compatible in materials size and appearance with the principal building b buffers and screening due to the intensity of the mixeduses in this district buffering and screening are particularly important to manage potential land use conflicts but because of the existing lot sizes and densities space for buffering is very limited for this reason a screening approach is required as a minimum standard but buffering is also permitted and encouraged in order to require buffers or screens more frequently and to allow for narrower buffers that better fit the sites in this neighborhood these regulations replace the landscape buffer requirements found in section  and the parking lot perimeter landscaping requirements found in section   and  still apply 1 screening is required around new development that involves a vehicle service use a production processing and storage use a transportation use or a parking area for any nonresidential use any of which that abuts a residential use on a separate parcel that is either directly adjacent or directly across the street or alley within the srli district the screening required under this section needs only to extend along those property boundaries where the residential use adjoins or is directly across the street or alley a in the application of this provision new development is defined as any of the following i new construction or reconstruction of buildings or other structures ii expansion or structural alteration of buildings or other structures that are visible from residential property within the srli district iii expansion or reconstruction of parking areas that are visible from residential property within the srli district iv erection or replacement of mechanical equipment that is visible from residential property within the srli district b buffer or screen depth no minimum depth is required but where landscaping materials are used the depth shall provide adequate space to sustain the long term health and growth of the plantings no less than five feet 2 as part of the conditional use process buffers or screens may be

height a maximum of six feet in height and not less than 90 percent opaque on a yearround basis screening located along front and corner side yards is limited to four feet in height and not less than 90 percent opaque on a yearround basis and which effectually blocks automobile headlights from trespass on adjacent property b screens that include landscaping are encouraged where there is adequate space on the site with at least one tree and five shrubs for every 50 linear feet recommended c because buffers are not required in the srli district fencing if used shall be constructed of visually appealing materials that do not detract from the value of adjacent residential properties woven wire ie chain link cyclone etc or sheet metal fencing are not permitted for screening any metal fencing used for screening shall be of a decorative variety board on board fencing masonry walls berms and landscape buffers are preferred d screening may be interrupted for necessary pedestrian and vehicle access e if a compliant screen is already present on the abutting property the new screen on the subject property should complement the existing screen and the requirements may be reduced accordingly for example backtoback fences or walls are not necessary but landscaping clusters may be added to enhance an existing berm fence or wall 4 proposed bufferscreen design shall be submitted on a site plan and community development review team review may be required as determined by the zoning administrator c note that the srli district will be considered a residential district when determining whether development outside of this district but adjacent to a residential use must comply with the buffering requirements of sections   or   parking and loading requirements in srli district parking

greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure b to provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land c to preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater floodplains wetlands streams steep slopes woodlands and wildlife habitat d to permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development e to reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development f to promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community and contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions g to encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood h to encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries i to promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connecting to surrounding areas businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles j to conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and view of open space k to preserve important historic and archaeological sites

finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff from land development activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction land development activity runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loadings 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine

storm water utility 1 findings a the city finds that the management of storm water and other surface water discharges within and beyond its borders is a matter that affects the public health safety and welfare of the city its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area the development of land increases impervious surfaces and results in increased storm water runoff failure to effectively manage this increased storm water runoff affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the green bay sanitary district by among other things increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary sewer in addition surface water runoff may create erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences with water damage and create sedimentation and other environmental damage in the city b the cost of operating and maintaining the city storm water system ensuring regulatory compliance and financing necessary plans studies repairs replacements improvements and

to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the construction site as follows 1 for permitted construction sites of land disturbing construction activity reduce the total suspended solids load by 80 percent on an average annual basis as compared with no sediment or erosion controls until the construction site has undergone final stabilization no person shall be required to exceed an 80 percent sediment reduction to meet the requirements of this paragraph erosion and sediment control bmps may be used alone or in combination to meet the requirements of this paragraph credit toward meeting the sediment reduction shall be given for limiting the duration or area or both of land disturbing construction activity or other appropriate mechanism 2 soil loss prediction tools that estimate the sediment load leaving the construction site under varying land and management conditions or methodology identified in subch v of ch nr 151 wis adm shall be used to calculate sediment reduction the soil loss prediction tool must show that bmps that by design discharge no more than five tons per acre per year or to the maximum extent practicable of the sediment load carried in runoff from initial grading to final stabilization 3 no person shall be required to employ more bmps than are needed to meet a performance standard in order to comply with maximum extent practicable erosion and sediment control bmps may be combined to meet the requirements of this paragraph credit may be given toward meeting the sediment performance standard of this paragraph for limiting the duration or area or both of land disturbing construction activity or for other appropriate mechanisms b notwithstanding paragraph a if bmps cannot be designed and implemented to reduce the sediment load by 80 percent on an average annual basis the plan shall include a written and sitespecific explanation as to why the 80 percent reduction goal is not attainable and the sediment load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable c site erosion control the following criteria apply only to land development or landdisturbing construction activities that result in runoff leaving the site 1 channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing site shall be diverted around disturbed areas if practical otherwise the channel shall be protected as described below in paragraph 3b or 3c sheet flow runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 05 feet sec across the

conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time 3 runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either subsection a and b or a and c and wdnr technical standards whichever is more restrictive a all disturbed ground left inactive for 15 or more days shall be stabilized by mulching temporary or permanent seeding sodding covering with tarps or equivalent control measures seeding and sodding may only be used from may 1 to september 15 of any year if temporary seeding is used a permanent cover shall also be required as part of the final site stabilization b for sites with ten or more acres disturbed at one time or if a channel originates in the disturbed area one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed sedimentation basins shall be designed constructed and maintained per wdnr technical standards at a minimum each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet the basin shall be designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size based on the set of oneyear design storms having duration from 05 to 24 hours the basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water c for sites with less than ten acres disturbed at one time filter fences straw bales or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site if a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes site filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel d runoff from sites or slopes of 12 percent or more may require additional or different control methods which are not listed in section 3 above d any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material should not be located with a down slope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel if remaining for 15 days or more the piles shall be stabilized by mulching vegetative cover tarps or other means erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than 15 days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile instreet utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control when exposed for more than 15 days and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bale or other appropriate filtering barriers 4 location the bmps used to comply with this section shall be located prior to runoff entering waters of the state or regional storm water treatment facilities regional storm water treatment facilities are appropriate for control of postconstruction pollutants they should not be used for construction site sediment removal 5
