of variances a the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance b the variance criteria set forth in this subchapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners c the city council shall help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate passed 9172014  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the alp s6 44 canyon lake  building and construction procedures of this subchapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in

the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its

present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment slope and topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection active alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion as a result any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards the technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage the federal emergency management agency fema has formulated a mapping procedure for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain regulation referred to as the fema alluvial fan methodology an active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria a flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex  b abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper upstream source area  and c an environment where the combination of sediment availability slope and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards but occurs only on alluvial fans it is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard counter to active alluvial fan flooding hazards an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths however areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding as with active alluvial fan flooding may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainly an alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding hazards the hazards may vary spatially or vary at the same location contingent on the level of flow discharge spatially for example upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan hazards may vary at the same location for example with a flow path that may be stable for lower flows but become unstable at higher flows more detailed information can be found at femas website guidelines for determining flood hazards on alluvial fans at  www femagovfhmft_afgd2 shtm# 1 47

guidelines the implementation of the hillside grading guidelines is essential to affect continued quality community development the city of canyon lake desires to encourage planning engineering and development that results in minimal site grading in addressing the varying terrain and highly visible hillside areas this can be accomplished by following the natural contours as much as possible from large scale subdivision design to individual lot grading plans graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing terrain significant natural vegetation should be retained and incorporated into projects whenever possible the guidelines shall apply unless specifically modified by the approving authority and findings are made that the modification is consistent with the findings listed in k hereof a grading must minimize the disturbance to the natural landform not destroy visual quality and community character nor create conditions that may result in landslides flooding or erosion b no grading shall take place in known or suspected hazardous areas as determined by the city without a geological survey andor other data and tests as requested by the city c projects located in hillside areas shall incorporate clustering varying setbacks multiple orientations and other site planning techniques to preserve open spaces protect natural features and offer views to residents d transitioning slopes minimal radius rounding at edges of cut and fill slopes is not acceptable proper transitioning from manufactured slopes to natural slopes shall be achieved gradually and naturally using radii or irregular curvilinear shapes that will blend into the adjoining topography tangentially and not create abrupt changes e good grading design must be exercised for safety as well as aesthetics and should incorporate the following measures 1 utilization of landform or contour measures to produce cutandfill slopes compatible with existing land character continuous unbroken slope surfaces that are visible from offsite are discouraged linear or straight slopes shall not alp s3 20 canyon lake  planning and zoning exceed 100feet in distance before next rounded contoured edge edges and exposed tops and toes of slopes shall be rounded with a minimum fivefoot radius where there are linear slopes up to 50 feet in length and tenfoot radius where linear slopes are greater than 50 feet the parallel planes of adjacent linear slopes shall be offset by minimum distance of tenfoot measured perpendicular to the planes 2 grading slopes contoured by varying slope increments and undulating banks vertically and horizontally 3 varied cutandfill banks and drainage terrace spacing to alleviate monotony and to allow informal landscaping 4 berms at top of slopes and other locations used to screen vary profile and ensure drainage away from slopes 5 varied pad levels to avoid appearance of monotonous slope banks and flat level lots f minimal grading this is typically used for large lot singlefamily homes custom homes with variable foundations that conform to the existing slopes and other uses such as golf courses that utilize the least amount of grading in order to get the facility and structures built but is also acceptable for commercial uses this technique embraces the following concepts 1 grading should be limited to individual flat graded pad areas for residential building sites grading should be limited to only the required building areas and adjacent outdoor amenities in steep hillside areas 2 foundation systems that require little or no grading are encouraged forcing the architecture to conform to the land rather than the land to conform to the dwelling 3 roadways driveways and individual building pads should be designed to conform with contours and to attempt to daylight in the center of the road or building pad to ensure a minimum cut and fill situation g all manufactured cut and fill slopes exceeding tenfeet in height which will be either exposed to permanent public view or are adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas should be designed with features characteristic of natural slopes where physically feasible so that their ultimate appearance will resemble a natural slope this will include slopes along streets and highways slopes adjacent to parks schools or open spaces and other public facilities and other prominent and visible slopes h clustering of development is encouraged within the allowable density identified in the general plan this is particularly important in environmentally sensitive areas in
