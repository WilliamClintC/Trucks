specifications for public works construction b hydrology 1 drainage area delineation the size and shape of each watershed and associated subbasins onsite and offsite shall be determined for each

electronic versions are not available when the city topographic information is insufficient or physical conditions may have changed from those shown on the maps it may be necessary to supplement the maps with field topographic surveys the actual conditions at the site should always be verified by a reconnaissance survey inlet placement should also be taken into account during the delineation of drainage areas each proposed inlet shall have an independent drainage area 2 rainfall the intensitydurationfrequency idf curve included in appendix a shows anticipated rainfall rates for storm durations from five minutes to 24 hours this curve has been prepared using the information contained in the us department of commerce hydro35 national technical information service publication no pb272112 june 1977 for storm durations less than 60 minutes for durations beyond 60 minutes the information shown was derived from technical paper no 40 soil conservation service may 1961 3 storm frequency the following guidelines shall be followed to determine the storm frequency to be used to design a storm drainage system drainage facility design recurrence interval closed storm sewer systems tenyear with 100year positive overflow for inlets on grade in streets such that the depth of flow in the street does not exceed the top of curb for inlets at low points or in a roadway sag the 100year flow must be captured within the curb culverts and bridges 100year concretelined channels 100year earthen channels 100year detention facilities 100year the drainage system shall provide overflow at all low points and identify the overflow path on the plans and on the plat as applicable the term positive overflow means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded the excess flow can be conveyed overland along a grassed or paved course normally this would mean along a street or alley if not the excess flow path shall require the dedications of drainage easements on private property 4 runoff calculations the selection of method to be used to calculate runoff depends upon the size of the contributing drainage area at the most downstream point of the project the rational method is acceptable for designing projects with drainage areas of less than 100 acres a unit hydrograph method is required for projects with larger drainage areas regardless of the method used runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed conditions in accordance with the ultimate land use assumption in the current ultimate land use plan for the city the design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream properties and calculating runoff as if the offsite property was developed without any detention if an approved regional detentionretention facility is in operation the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility a procedure for drainage areas less than 100 acres 1 methodology the rational method is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge therefore the duration of the storm used is equivalent to the time of concentration of the basin the formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is q   cia where q   the maximum rate of discharge cfs c   coefficient of runoff based on topography soil land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the rainfall producing runoff occurs i   intensity of rainfall for the time period it takes for flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to reach the point of design inhr a   drainage area contributing to the runoff at the specified concentration pointoutfall acres 2 runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient c in the rational method equation is dependent on the character of the soil and the degree and type of development in the drainage area normally as a drainage area develops the amount of runoff increases in proportion to the amount of impervious area the runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate land use as recommended in the current city ultimate land use plan 3 time of concentration the time of concentration is the longest time without interruption of flow by detention devices for a drop of water to flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to the point of concentration point of design of the basin note that this is not necessarily the point at the longest physical distance from the point of concentration but the point from which it will take runoff the longest time to reach the concentration point scs methodology is recommended to determine the time of concentration t c  this method separates the flow watershed into three regimes sheet flow shallow concentrated flow and open channel flow  sheet flow sheet flow is flow over plane surfaces it occurs in the uppermost area of the defined basin the time of concentration in minutes for sheet flow is determined using the following equation t c sheetflow   60 d  v where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second t c   time of concentration minutes the longest flowpath for the water is determined for each basin begins at the most hydraulically distant point in the basin and ends at the concentration point for the basin the sheet flow length is then measured along this flowpath from the uppermost part of the basin for a length no more than 300 feet at a maximum distance of 300 feet sheet flow typically changes to shallow concentrated flow a slope should be estimated along this length of flow a velocity corresponding to this slope was determined using the upland method graph found in appendix a  shallow concentrated flow shallow concentrated flow typically begins where sheet flow ends a projected slope should be established along the flowline for the shallow concentrated flow length a velocity corresponding to this slope is determined from the shallow concentrated flow graph in appendix a the time of concentration in minutes for shallow concentrated flow is determined by the following equation t c shallowconcentratedflow   60 d  v where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second t c   time of concentration minutes  open channel flow open channel flow is applicable for large channel sections and closed storm sewers in some cases in most cases it is not applicable for the rational method since large channels indicate large watersheds where a unit hydrograph method is applied in the city the time of concentration for open channel flow is determined using the following equations t c channelflow   60 d  v where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second t c   time of concentration minutes where v is estimated using a combination of the continuity equation and mannings equation v   n r 23 s 12 where n   mannings n r   ap   hydraulic radius feet a   area square feet p   wetted perimeter feet s   slope feet feet   resulting time of concentration the time of concentration is the sum of the sheet flow shallow flow and open channel flow segments t c   t c sheetflow + t c shallowconcentratedflow + t c channelflow  resulting time of concentration of inlets when designing inlets and laterals the time of concentration is equal to the inlet time the design engineer shall compare the specified inlet times in the table below to the actual calculated inlet time by computing the flow time overland and along the gutter to the first inlet in no case shall a shorter inlet time or time of concentration be used than the times specified in the table below the following table includes the values for coefficient of runoff and minimum inlet time for different land uses in

average flow velocity of six feet per second from the inlet to the point of concentration b procedures for drainage areas greater than 100 acres 1 methodology a unit hydrograph method is required for

in question for artificial channels and storm drainage systems stream routing can be performed using the muskingum cunge method that method uses the mannings coefficient reach length channel slope and shape of the channel to determine the storage of the channel reach in ponds and natural channels the modified puls routing method should be used the modified puls method uses a stagestoragedischarge
