legislature has in ic 3674 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the city council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 9152014  422 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 9152014  423 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and fmake federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 9152014  424 objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight

number shall be round down to the nearest whole number   examples of how to calculate the maximum number of animals permitted in a rural residential zoning district example 1 a 7acre lot is located in an rrb zoning district and the owner wants to have some cows but he or she also has 3 horses and 40 chickens how many cows can he or she have and still have the 3 horses and 40 chickens  from table 2a the maximum aue per acre for the rrb district is 100 since there is 7 acres the total allowable aue for the lot is 100 x 700   700 aue  the aue table shows that each horse and cow has an aue of 100 and chickens have an aue of 003 calculate the total aue for 40 chickens 40 x 003   12  calculate the total aue for 3 horses 3 x 100   300 total aue for the chickens and horses is 120 + 300   420 the remaining aue that can be used for additional animals is 700  420   280 a mature cow has an aue of 100  therefore the number of mature cows allowed is 280 10   280 rounding to the next lower whole number the maximum number of cows allowed is 2 example 2 a 160acre lot is located in an rrc zoning district and the owner wants to have 50 chickens and some sheep if he or she has 50 chickens how many sheep can he or she have  from table 2a the maximum aue per acre for the rrc district is 050 and given a lot size of 160 acres the total aue permitted on the lot is 050 x 160   080 aue  the aue table shows that the aue for one chicken is 003 since the owner wants 50 chickens the total aue is 003 x 50   150 which exceeds the allowable aue of 080 for the 160 acre lot therefore 50 chickens are not allowable  how many chickens are allowed the number of allowed chickens is 080003   2667 rounding to the next lower whole number shows that 26 chickens are allowed  the owner now wants to have 1 sheep and reduce the number of chickens one sheep has an aue of 010 so the aue available for chickens is 080  010   070 the number of permitted chickens is calculated as 070003   232 rounding to the next lower whole number shows that 23 chickens are allowed example 3 a 1450acre lot is zoned rra husband and wife owners want to raise heifer cattle hogs and chickens but primarily heifers the wife needs to have a minimum of 100 laying hens they both agree that they want 2 hogs to butcher how many heifers are permitted on the 1450 acres  from table 2a the maximum aue per acre for the rra district is 100 and given the lot size of 1450 acres the total aue permitted is 1450 x 10   1450 aue  the aue table shows the aue for 1 chicken is 003 and for 1 hog 55 lbs to 300 lbs is 030 therefore for 100 chickens and 2 hogs the total aue is 100 x 003 + 2 x 030   360 aue given a total aue for the lot is 1450 then the balance that can be used for heifers is 1450  360   1090 aue heifers have an aue of 070  therefore the number of heifers allowed is 1090070   1557 rounding to the next lower whole number shows that 15 heifer cattle are allowed   table 2a1 description of restriction excludes b1 lot b1

following chart of buffering distances these distances shall be applied to all incompatible adjacent land uses as noted dspecial exceptions in applying the requirements of the chart attention should be focused on the actual use in a proposed zone if the use involves a special exception appropriate buffering should be determined by the requirements of the zone in which the special exception use would normally be located see the following chart of buffering distances on the following page eeffectiveness of buffers 1the goal of these buffering requirements is to describe the minimum buffering required to protect one use from the potentially negative effects of an intruding use attention should be given to adistance between incompatible uses  bwidth of buffer  cheight of buffer  and dsubstance of material used to buffer 2consideration must be given to the specific use within a particular intruding zone as not all uses in a given zone will have the same negative effects on surrounding land uses different kinds of buffers will be required by different intruding uses to effectively buffer protected uses 3the performance standard of the buffer should be that the protected use should be no more affected by the intruding uses presence as it would be by the presence of any use that would not require a buffer fexamples of buffers 1in general natural buffers are preferred over humanmade buffers anatural buffers include 1topographical variations including hills and ravines  2vegetation including evergreen trees and dense growths of deciduous trees and hedges  3bodies of water including creeks ponds and lakes  4combinations of the above including landscaped mounds  and 5judicious site planning with regard to prevailing wind directions bhumanmade buffers include 1intervening nonintruding land uses  2fences  and 3pools 2the appropriateness and adequacy of a proposed buffer should be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness at mitigating anticipated negative effects of an intruding use if equivalent effectiveness can be obtained with alternative buffering methods not listed above they should be looked upon with favor by the governing body  chart of
