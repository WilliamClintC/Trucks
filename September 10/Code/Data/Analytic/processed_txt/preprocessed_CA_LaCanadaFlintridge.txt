of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 that it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 that of of the

hillsides are a valuable resource to the community providing a visible geographical boundary to the city and aesthetic relief to the viewscape from virtually every location in la caada flintridge to date hillside development in this community has generally avoided creating the significant negative effects common to the practice of mass grading to provide building sites the end product of past development practices in la caada flintridge has largely been the retention of natural land forms and the communitys semirural character however much of the remaining undeveloped acreage in the city can best be described as steep consisting of slopes in excess of thirty 30 or forty 40 percent andor visually prominent further the citys hillsides contain or surround several significant environmental and aesthetic resources and are traversed by hiking and riding trails the purpose of this chapters development standards and guidelines is to protect existing open space and to ensure that any hillside development is orderly and consistent with desirable existing surrounding development patterns is carried out in a manner which promotes and enhances public safety and general welfare and is not disruptive of the predominant hillside character of the community 2 2002  policies the following policies are reflective of community standards and shall apply to all hillside development projects undertaken in the city a existing community character as defined by such factors as visual appearance density road widths and vegetation shall be preserved andor enhanced  b prominent landforms within the community including but not limited to ridgelines knolls valleys creeks either dry or active or other unique topographic features or viewscapes shall be maintained the most significant of such landforms are identified in the prominent landform policy of the citys general plan c major hillside viewscapes visible from points within the city shall not be detrimentally altered by the intrusion of highly visible cut andor fill slopes building lines andor road surfaces  d the visual impact of grading shall be minimized  e levels of development shall be coordinated with available and potential circulation capacities and shall be controlled by the ability to provide adequate access within the constraints defined in this chapter  f development in areas of exposure to high fire risk shall be subject to reasonable mitigation measures formulated during the project review process to reduce such risk  g development shall be planned in such a manner as to avoid flood mudslide and subsidence to residents and structures on or near hillside areas as well as downstream of any project  h significant environmental and recreational resources shall be maintained and enhanced including measures to prevent visual or physical encroachment into such resources  and i new lots created under the provisions of this chapter shall be properly planned and designed to result in development which is in conformance with this chapter 2 2002  applicability a this chapter shall apply to any lot or parcel of land residentially zoned and in residential use which has an average slope of fifteen 15 percent or greater additionally the provisions of this chapter shall apply to previously graded hillside lots the slope of which had been equal to or greater than fifteen 15 percent prior to grading and for which no building permits currently in effect have been issued b for the purposes of this chapter average slope shall be defined as the relationship between the change in elevation rise of the land and the horizontal distance run over which that change in elevation occurs the average slope s is computed on the net area of a parcel by the following formula s   100il a where s   average percent slope i   contour interval in feet l   summation of length of all contours in feet a   area in square feet of parcel being considered c city hillside development permit

parcel is unique for many criteria a fixed standard may not be an appropriate means of ensuring harmonious development due to the complexities of topography the varying degree of site visibility the effects of local soil conditions on prospective landscaping and many other variables thus this chapter contains not only development standards mandatory or shall statements but also guidelines qualified shall statements thresholds are also included indicating the level of review required for a given category of project as outlined in c the intent is not to discourage appropriate project characteristics which require higher levels of review but rather to ensure that the opportunity is provided for public review of projects of any theoretical potential for disruption of the hillside
