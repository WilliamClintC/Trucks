facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection 3 are met 3 an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  c the industrial user submitted the following information to the potw and treatment plant operator within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance 2 the period of noncompliance

judicial determination on any claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 6 the industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided the requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b generalspecific prohibitions an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 294a of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharge from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section a if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible b an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the potw within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it became aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided with five 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 2 bypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection 2 of this section 3 the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in subsection 3a of this section art 1 81511 miscellaneous

usage and metered sewage 2 in lieu of a sewage meter the user may install auxiliary water meters to measure that portion of water used which is diverted from entering the sewage system in the event an auxiliary water meter is installed the volume of water metered by such meters shall be deducted from the total volume of water usage before the sewer service rate schedule is applied c no refunds allowances or reductions from the one hundred 100 percent water use base will be granted commercial or industrial users for any time period prior to approval of a sewage metering or diverted water metering system art 1 81511 determination of extra strength a the city will perform analyses at intervals no greater than twelve 12 months to determine the strength of sewage discharged by commercial
