which may be affected by unplanned land usage  4252001 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote preserve and enhance the natural resources within the city of falcon heights and protect them from adverse effects occasioned by 1 poorly sited development or incompatible activities by regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive land  2 minimizing conflicts and encouraging compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water quality and environmentally sensitive lands  and 3 requiring detailed review standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed for such areas thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development and protection of water quality and natural areas  4252001 definitions for the purposes of this chapter the following terms phrases words and their derivatives shall have
