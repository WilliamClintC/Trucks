texas  1977  new york new york times square  1994  and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the city council finds a sexually oriented businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation b sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area c each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the citys rationale for this chapter exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses additionally the citys interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city the city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects as added by #795 april 200 as replaced by #816 dec 2006 91102 definitions for purposes of this chapter the

purpose authority and jurisdiction a purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore to the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards the following subdivision regulations guiding the planning commission are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the planned region  to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provisions for light air recreation transportation water drainage sewer and other sanitary facilities b authority these subdivision regulations are adopted under authority granted by tennessee the planning commission has fulfilled the

vegetation shall be maintained andor installed which is at least thirty 30 feet in width as measured from the top of the bank of such stream or body of water except as may be in conflict with the intent of this ordinance provisions of the zoning ordinance flood damage prevention ordinance or other ordinances and regulations of the city buffer areas may be occupied by nonpolluting uses and areas such as grassed or landscaped yards park and picnic areas greenways walking trails andor undisturbed native vegetation the stormwater technician may allow driveway and road construction to occur buffer upon finding that the integrity of the buffer will not be compromised permits for stream crossings may also require permits from federal state and other local agencies b whenever a development or redevelopment is adjacent to a stream or has a stream flowing property designated as impaired or high quality then a buffer zone shall be maintained in accordance with the most current tncgp discharges into impaired or high quality waters an undisturbed vegetative buffer of thirty 30 feet as measured from the topofbank shall be maintained adjacent to all freeflowing waters of the state located including bodies of water such as perennial and intermittent streams rivers ponds and lakes and wetlands buffer width depends on the size of the drainage area streams or other waters with drainage areas less than 1 square mile will require buffer widths of 30ft of buffer zone streams or other waters with drainage areas greater that 1 square mile will require buffer widths of 60ft minimum in all urbanized areas a 60 feet  buffer width has been established for sites that contain or are adjacent to a receiving stream designated as impaired or exceptional waters this 60ft buffer can be established on an average width basis at a project as long as the minimum width of the buffer is more than 30 feet  at any measured location in areas of the jurisdiction an undisturbed vegetative buffer of thirty 30 feet can be established on an average basis at a project as long as the minimum width of the buffer is no more than fifteen 15 feet at any measured location vegetated preferably native water quality buffers protect water bodies by providing structural integrity and canopy as well as storm water infiltration filtration and evapotranspiration buffer zones are not primary sediment control measures and should not be relied upon as such every effort should be made of construction activities not to take place within the buffer and the buffer should remain in its undisturbed state of vegetation bmps providing equivalent protection to a receiving stream as 31 a natural riparian buffer zone may be used at a construction site such bmps shall be designed to be effective in protecting the receiving water from effects of stormwater runoff as a natural riparian zone a justification for use and a design of equivalent bmps shall be included in the swppp such equivalent bmps are expected to be routinely used at a construction project typically located adjacent to surface waters these projects include but ate not limited to sewer line construction roadway construction utility line or equipment installation greenway construction construction of a permanent outfall or a velocity dissipating structure etc enhancements restoration and reestablishment may be allowed with proper permits the authority may allow a variance to the water quality buffer requirements when a variance is allowed by the authority mitigation must be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment as the undisturbed buffer a determination that standards cannot be met may not be based solely on the difficulty or cost associated with implementation if it is infeasible to provide an undisturbed naturally vegetated buffer of any size between the disturbed portion of your site and any waters of the state sediment and erosion controls certified by a tn licensed professional engineer to achieve the equivalent sediment load reduction as an undisturbed naturally vegetated 30foot buffer may be implemented on approval by the storm water appeals board 1 exception if preexisting development on the site has resulted in significant disturbances within the 30foot buffer for example sites where all vegetation in the 30foot buffer area has been removed and replaced with impervious surfaces as a result of prior development you are exempt from complying with the buffer requirements as long as the area of encroachment is not extended 32 post construction 1 landscaping and stabilization requirements a any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be revegetated according to a schedule approved by the pigeon forge public works dept storm water technician the following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts 1 reseeding must be done with an annual or

established and are capable of controlling erosion 3 any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventyfive percent 75% of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum seventyfive percent 75% survival for one 1 year is achieved 4 if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements the authority may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume timing and rate of runoff 5 for projects discharging to waters considered impaired by sediment or habitat alteration due to inchannel erosion the swppp shall include a description of measures that will be installed during the

shall also include a description of measures that will be installed to dissipate the volume and energy of the stormwater runoff to predevelopment levels 6 velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide a nonerosive velocity flow from the structure to the receiving stream so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the stream are maintained and protected eg there should be no significant changes in the hydrological regime of the receiving water the swppp shall include an explanation of the technical basis used to select the velocity dissipation devices to control pollution where flows exceed predevelopment levels the tennessee erosion and sediment control handbook provides measures that can be incorporated into the design or implemented on site to decrease erosive velocities an aquatic resources alteration permit arap may be required if such velocity dissipation devices installed would alter the receiving stream and or its bank 33 b in addition to the above requirements a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed this plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction but who will

must be taken into account in selection of runoff reduction management measures c incentive standards for redeveloped sites a 10% reduction in the volume of rainfall to be managed for any of the following types of developments such credits are additive so that a maximum reduction of 50% of the runoff reduction requirements for a project that meets all 5 criteria 1 redevelopment 2 brownfield redevelopment 3 high density development 4 vertical density 5 mixed use and transit oriented development within  mi d pollutant removal  for projects in urbanized areas that cannot meet 100% of the runoff reduction requirement unless subject to the incentive standards the remainder of the stipulated amount of rainfall must be treated prior to discharge with a technology reasonably expected to remove 80% of the total suspended solids tss the treatment technology must be designed installed and maintained to continue to meet this performance standard e offsite mitigation  for projects in urbanized areas that cannot meet 100% of the runoff reduction requirements the authority may allow runoff reduction measures to be implemented at another location within the same usgs 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc as the original project offsite mitigation must be a minimum of 15 times the amount of water not managed on site the offsite mitigation location or alternative location
