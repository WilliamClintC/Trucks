attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variation is requested in no event however shall the city grant a variation which would allow the

of the property would impose upon the owner a practical difficulty or particular hardship as opposed to a mere inconvenience if the requirements of this strictly enforced  and 2 the plight of the property owner was not created by the owner and is due to unique circumstances  and 3 the difficulty or hardship is peculiar to the property in question and is not generally shared by other properties classified in the same zoning district andor used for the same purposes  and 4 the difficulty or hardship resulting from the application of this title would prevent the owner from making a reasonable use of the property  however the fact that the property could be utilized more profitably with the variation than without the variation shall not be considered as grounds for granting the variation  and 13 21 5 the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or otherwise injure other property or its use will not substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public health safety morals and welfare and will not substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood  and 6 the variation if granted will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will be consistent with the goals objectives and policies set forth in the comprehensive plan 7 the variation will not unreasonably increase the

neighborhood in which the property is located  and 3 whether the granting of the variance will be beneficial to the public welfare of the city as a whole  and 4 whether the granting of the variance will adversely impact the use or structure on abutting properties and if so whether the applicant is proposing to provide a landscaped or other appropriate buffer to reduce those adverse impacts  and 5 whether the granting of the variance will either increase the number of employees hired by the applicant or allow the applicant to maintain a profitable business within the city  and 6 whether the nonconforming use andor structure has existed for more than five years  and 7 whether the applicant has been offered significant financial incentives by the city andor county to relocate his or her nonconforming use andor structure within the city andor county 61340 jurisdiction a when a property owner or his agent shows that a strict application of the terms of the zoning title relating to the use construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land imposes upon him practical difficulties or particular hardship then the zoning board of appeals may grant such variations of the strict application of the terms of the zoning title as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent when the board is satisfied under the evidence heard before it that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the provisions of the zoning title or in the following instances 1 to permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a zoning district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record prior to the date
