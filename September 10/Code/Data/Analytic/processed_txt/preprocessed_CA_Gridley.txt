improvement agreements aany deferred improvement required by the city engineer pursuant to contain the following precautionary warnings to the owner in substantially the following form precautionary warnings to owner the owner is cautioned and advised that by entering into this agreement the owners legal rights and property rights will be affected as examples and not by way of limitation owner is apprised of the following with respect to this agreement 1the agreement will create a lien against owners property a lien is a charge or security upon property for payment of some debt obligation or duty in this particular case this agreement will be recorded in the butte county recorders office and the lien will be of public record in the event owner fails to abide by the terms and conditions of this agreement the city would have the right to foreclose the lien ie the city would have the right to sell owners property in satisfaction of the obligation in addition the recording of the lien could prevent or make difficult the ability to obtain a loan from a lender secured by owner s property 2this agreement gives the city the right at anytime to call due owners performance under this agreement upon the giving of ninety 90 days notice it is very difficult for the city to predict the time when it might require owners performance under the agreement and owner should not assume that any particular length of time will pass before the city gives ninety 90 days notice to perform 3owner acknowledges that the obligations created by this agreement will run with the land which means that these obligations are imposed both upon owner and any successor to the owner and in that regard the recordation of this agreement might cause the fair market value of owners property to decrease 4owner is further advised that exhibit b to this agreement sets forth the street frontage improvements to be constructed however it is difficult to determine the scope of the improvement work until the project is designed and adequate survey data is available it is also possible that the field conditions may change between the time this agreement is executed and the time the improvements are constructed the cost of the improvements may involve items not easily estimated such as utility relocation costs undergrounding of culverts street widening and the like the construction costs will vary depending upon the method of contracting for the work private construction is normally less expensive than a public works project 5finally owner is encouraged to contact a qualified real estate agent attorney or other person of appropriate qualifications and expertise to advise them regarding the potential impact of this agreement on the value andor marketability of their property or to in any other respect counsel them regarding the consequences of signing this agreement 6in the event the owner has requested an engineers estimate pursuant to gridley municipal c it is expressly understood and agreed that the city engineers estimates shall not be binding upon the city for purposes of any subsequent construction or the owners costs thereunder and said estimate shall be given as an accommodation to the owner and to aid the owners decision whether or not to enter into this deferred improvement agreement as opposed to installing frontage improvements concomitantly with the development of the land the subject of this agreement in addition the failure of this deferred improvement agreement to contain the language specified in gridley municipal shall not invalidate the agreement if it would otherwise be enforceable without such provisions bin addition to the foregoing warnings any deferred improvement agreement between the city and the owner shall advise the owner that the requirement to install frontage improvements does not necessarily mean that the improvements shall be located at the front of the dwelling or other structure being constructed by the owner in addition any deferred improvement agreement shall contain a provisions that the owners obligations to construct frontage improvements shall occur not less than 90 days after notification by the city of gridley that the owner must proceed to construct frontage improvements as specified in the deferred improvement agreement cupon receipt of a written request from the owner prior to the execution of any deferred improvement agreement under the city engineer shall prepare an estimate as to the specific frontage improvements and the estimated cost of construction which would be required if the owner were to install the frontage improvements at the present time the city engineers estimates shall not be binding upon the city for purposes of any subsequent construction or the owners costs thereunder but shall be given as an accommodation to the owner and to aid the owners decision whether or not to enter into a deferred improvement agreement as opposed to installing the frontage improvements at the time of the new construction for development of the land in question the failure of a deferred improvement agreement to contain the terms specified in this section shall not invalidate the agreement if it would otherwise be enforceable without such provisions  installation required for occupancy the construction of curbs and gutters andor sidewalks shall be deemed to be an integral part of the overall construction when such construction is required as a condition of the permit as set forth in this chapter and the premises shall not be passed upon for occupancy by the building inspector until the required curbs and gutters andor sidewalks are properly and completely installed  part 1987  installation by citycosts aif the property owner does not provide for the

on the matter giving ten days notice to the land owner of its intention to commence construction of the curbs and gutters andor sidewalks at which hearing the land owner may appear and object andor agree to forthwith comply with this chapter cif the land owner has not complied within thirty days of the public hearing then the city will proceed to install the curbs and gutters andor sidewalks

noncompliance with the general prohibitions in a of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in b 3 b20 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either aa local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or bno local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city of gridley was regularly in compliance with its waste discharge requirements and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  bypass afor the purposes of this section 1bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production ba user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c1if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the director of public works at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2a user shall submit oral notice to the director of public

public works may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d1bypass is prohibited and the director of public works may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless abypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  bthere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and cthe user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2the director of public works may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the director of public works

required to pay their fair share of capital improvements needed as a result of the projected growth further that the capital improvement cost for new growth is determined in the city development impact fee study bthat the city finds that it is necessary that its development impact fee for capital improvements go into effect immediately in order that all properties in the city pay their fair share of the cost associated with the improvements immediate implementation of these fees is necessary due to the current and immediate threat to public safety which will result should there be a

elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in d1 ffloodways since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply 1until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any point within the city of gridley 2within an adopted regulatory floodway the city of gridley shall prohibit encroachments including fill new

increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 3if f1 and 2 are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   variance procedure anature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of gridley to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bconditions for variances 1generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of gridley need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of gridley believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and bsuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the butte county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency cappeal board 1in passing upon requests for variances the city of gridley shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the adanger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bdanger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  csusceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  dimportance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community

property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jexpected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and kcosts of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2variances shall only be issued upon a ashowing of good and sufficient cause  bdetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and cdetermination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of c1 c4 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes
