improved air quality and enhanced aesthetics 6 disconnect downspouts from roofs and direct the flow to vegetated infiltrationfiltration areas such as rain gardens 7 retain rooftop runoff in a rain barrel for later onlot use in lawn and garden watering 8 use multifunctional open drainage systems in lieu of more conventional curbandgutter systems 9 use bioretention cells as rain gardens in

of system failure 11 reduce sidewalk width and grade them such that they drain to the front yard of a residential lot or retention area 12 reduce impervious impacts of residential driveways by narrowing widths and moving access to the rear of the site 13 use shared driveways 14 reduce width of residential streets depending on traffic and parking needs 15 reduce street length primarily in
