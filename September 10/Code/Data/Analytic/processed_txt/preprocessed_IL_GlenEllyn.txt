promote progressive development of land and construction thereon by encouraging more creative and imaginative design for land developments than is possible under the more conventional zoning regulations by allowing planned unit developments as a particular type of special use within each zoning district the planned unit development provisions are intended to allow more efficient use of land and thus result in more economical land development further the planned unit development provisions allow greater design flexibility than is normally permitted by the district regulations thereby encouraging more rational utilization of the topographic and natural characteristics of the property as a means of promoting preservation of natural site qualities better urban amenities more open space and a higher quality project  b the following objectives may be obtained use of the planned unit development procedure 1 to permit a maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by allowing a variety of housing andor commercial uses in a single development and permitting a flexible application of the individual district regulations for each use  2 to promote a more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and if permitted as part of the project more convenience in the location of commercial uses serving nearby residential areas  3 to encourage a development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and geological features scenic vistas trees and other vegetation and prevents the disruption of natural drainage pattern  4 to facilitate a development pattern more in harmony with the objectives of the comprehensive plan for land use transportation facilities and community facilities  c the planned unit development is intended to provide for developments incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a unit such development should provide amenities not otherwise required by law and establish facilities and open space greater than the minimums required by law  d the planned unit development may also provide for a greater population density in undeveloped areas than that reflected by the present zoning restrictions provided the developer demonstrates that any increment of public cost attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the planned unit development  e the planned unit development may provide for a wide range of development techniques and ownership methods including conventional subdivisions cluster developments zero lot line subdivisions with common areas controlled by an owners association condominium ownership of land and buildings or other ownership
