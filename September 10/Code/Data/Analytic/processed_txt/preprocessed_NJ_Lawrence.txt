effect on or before  the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed 4% of the average rent levels for that apartment for the preceding 12 months in calculating average rent for an apartment for the preceding 12 months for any month in which no rent or less than full rent was charged because of a vacancy the rent to be employed for calculation purposes is the last full months rent charged for that apartment 2 for extensions and renewals taking effect on or after  the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed the percentage increase in the index provided for in hereof calculated by comparing the index for the immediately preceding calendar year at years end with the year and index for the calendar year immediately preceding that year thus for increases in 1986 governed by this section the percentage increase is to be determined by comparing the 1985 years end index with the 1984 years end index if for example the 1984 years end index were 200 and the 1985 years index were 210 then the percentage increase allowable in 1986 would be calculated as follows 210  200 200   005 the aforesaid percentage increase would be applied to the average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months as calculated in accordance with 1 above for the purposes of determining the maximum increase allowable thus if the index calculations were to produce a maximum allowable percentage increase of 5% and if the average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months were to be $500 then the maximum allowable increase for that apartment on an extension or renewal would be $25 $500 x 005 3 for extensions and renewals taking effect on or after  the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed the percentage increase in the consumer

lawrence code  32517   32518 powers of the rent stabilization board year immediately preceding that year thus for increases in 1993 governed by this section the percentage increase is to be determined by comparing the index for the month of september 1992 with the index for the month of september 1991 for example the index for the month of september 199 was 1352 if the index for the month of september 1992 were to be 14190 then the percentage increase allowable in 1993 would be calculated as follows 14190  1352 1352   005 after rounding to the nearest 001 or 5% the aforesaid percentage increase would be applied to the average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months as calculated in accordance with 1 above for the purposes of determining the maximum increase allowable thus if the index calculations were to produce a maximum allowable percentage increase of 5% and if the average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months were to be $500 then the maximum allowable increase for that apartment on an extension or renewal would be $25 $500 x 005 b beginning  the index to be utilized for making the calculations called for by 2 above shall

a danger to the lives and property of the public  that such flooding is also a danger to the natural resources of the municipality the county and the state  that development tends to accentuate such flooding by increasing storm water runoff due to alteration of the hydrologic response of the watershed in changing from the undeveloped to the developed condition  that such increased flooding produced by the development of real property contributes increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and tends to increase channel erosion  that such increased flooding increased erosion and increased pollution constitutes deterioration of the water resources of the municipality the county and the state  and that such increased flooding increased erosion and increased pollution can be controlled by the regulation of storm water runoff from such development it is therefore determined that it is in the public interest to regulate the development of real property and to establish standards to regulate the discharge of storm water runoff from such developments as provided in this storm water management goals storm water management plans submitted pursuant to shall demonstrate

required to achieve the minimum density required shall be as set forth in this subsection if a site initially lacks the sufficient density of trees required or if site clearing reduces the tree density to below the minimum required the developer shall plant additional trees to meet the minimum these trees are termed replacement trees regardless of whether they are for initial planting to meet minimum requirements or for replanting after site clearing has occurred trees otherwise required to be planted for landscape buffer areas or parking lots pursuant to 525 as the case may be may be counted towards the required tree density the planting of replacement trees shall be required under the following conditions a to establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site  b where

replacement trees shall be sufficient to produce a total required tree density rds of at least 15 units per acre as described herein units shall be determined based on the conversion factors in tables 519 520 and 521 3 the spacing of replacement trees shall be compatible with areal limitations and the characteristics of the species that are planted 4 when the administrative officer or his designee

be provided in the form of payment of 80% of the uniform unit prices for bond estimates as prepared by the division of engineering and shall be placed in a shade tree account i calculations for rtd calculations for determining the required tree density rtd are as follows 1 step 1 required tree density shall be calculated by multiplying the factor of 15 by the gross tract area example 2 acre site has a rtd of 30 2 x 15   30 2 step 2 the existing tree density etd of the trees that are to remain within the tree save area of the tree protection zone shall be calculated by converting the caliper from the tree survey see paragraph d4 and d6 above to tree density units as indicated in table 519 example the tree survey identifies 15 trees that will remain on the site in the step 1 example after development as follows 7  12 locusts 3  14 maples 3  18 oaks 1  20 oak 1  30 sycamore converting the caliper to tree density units yields the following values caliper density units no trees etd 12 8 x

replacement tree units to caliper inches or tree height based on tables 520 and 521 any number or combination of trees that meets the minimum required for replacement may be used  however coniferous evergreens shall be limited to no more than 40% of the total required replacement trees example 10  3 red oaks   60 tree units  2  4 sycamores   14 tree units  and 3  2 river birch   15 tree units for
