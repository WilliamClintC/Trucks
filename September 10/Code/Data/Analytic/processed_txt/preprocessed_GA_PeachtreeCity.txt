prior to preparation and submittal of a site plan the applicant should evaluate the proposed developments compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development to the greatest extent practicable the site plan shall be prepared in a manner that will conserve and protect natural resources including air quality trees natural vegetation existing topography streams creeks wetlands watersheds water quality and wildlife habitat development of each site should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes ie access building sewage disposal etc where appropriate existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety  access the entire parcel rather than simply a particular project shall be considered in formulating and approving access plans interparcel site access for pedestrians golf carts and vehicles should be provided to adjacent properties when land uses are compatible common access easements for shared driveways along state highways and busy streets are strongly encouraged if at all feasible with the development plan service functions eg deliveries

and loading areas separate from main circulation and parking areas  grading plan developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion where cut and fill is required balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged abrupt or unnaturalappearing grading is strongly discouraged every effort should be made to avoid the creation of harsh easily eroded banks and cuts the height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping tall smoothfaced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas where this is not possible the walls shall be finished in a manner that is compatible with the exterior of the building and screened with landscaping terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls particularly in highly

period not to exceed 180 days subject to the approval of the city engineer  3 major transmission lines which do not provide service to adjoining properties but are intended to distribute service between substations subject to the approval of the city engineer  and 4 when an electric distribution line already exists overhead on adjacent to or across the street from a piece of property zoned for industrial use that line may be extended overhead to the industrial property provided the overhead line extension is placed underground at the closest feasible point to the property line and does not attach directly to any structure on the property  and 5 underground utility lines being installed relocated or upgraded within the city shall be located in accordance with standard drawings 303 and 304 in the design standards section at the rear of the this land development ordinance those utilities being placed along publicly owned and maintained rightsofway shall follow drawing number 303 those utilities being placed along privately owned and maintained streets shall follow drawing number 304 exceptions may be granted by the city engineer with the concurrence of the utility company or companies involved  marking standards for underground utilities i definitions the following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article a emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life health or property  the interruption of utility services  or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action b extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article such extraordinary circumstances may include but shall not be limited to hurricanes tornadoes floods ice and snow and acts of god ii white lining a background white lining is a practice that has been widely used in the united states where the national transportation board concluded that premarking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage the procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where white lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked b purpose the purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation white lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time this technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately in short premarking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate c examples  timing examples of areas to be white lined are smaller involving only a portion of a particular address or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines service lines such as for water gas electricity and sewer utility pits cuts and repairs curb repairs bore holes directional boring pathways pole and signage placements etc such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive white lining shall be completed prior to contacting ga811 to obtain a locate request ticket number electronicvirtual white lining is not an acceptable or recognized method d exceptions to white lining exceptions are allowed as follows 1 unless one or more utility facilities are damaged five times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90day contract period white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with gpsc rule 5159413 a copy of gpsc rule 5159413 currently in effect is attached as exhibit a and by this reference is incorporated herein a large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt as stated above will be subject to no more than a twoday shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon  2 homeownersoccupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel homeownersoccupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business a contractor or a utility businesses contractors and utilities are not exempt from white lining  3 emergencies and extraordinary circumstances as such terms are defined herein are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and hence also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section however if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance then the excavators failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section also preexcavation emergency locate ticket requests that is a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section  4 residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential addressparcel requests only  and 5 termite baiting systems e white lining symbols as directions to locator white lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines andor arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated start and end of such linear white line therefore it is important to identify the starting and ending points f identification of white lining excavator in order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavators name or the applicable locate ticket number or both iii facility marking by or for utilities a utility markings facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their upc alpha code along with the type material if known that the facility consists of at the beginning and end of locates also arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues in accomplishing the locate task the line locator shall use industryapproved and generally accepted methods of locating the tolerance zone shall be 24 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities 1 to avoid confusion on long runs the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner 2 the marks shall indicate the approximate centerline of the underground lines for example the middle of the cable line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks 3 location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet 4 the line locator person marking the lines shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area 5 in areas such as flower beds rock gardens etc flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint the decision to use flags paint or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions for instance flags or stakes in wet areas offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks 6 dead ends stubouts termination points etc shall be marked as follows 7 lines that have connections eg ts or ys or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy 8 manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover 9 facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner 10 unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known by placing a green t or y or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral 11 when facilities share the same trench they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified this would apply to lines that share the same color code for example cable television and telephone lines 12 if the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known if the size is not known then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches 13 duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot 14 in areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface however offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark for example the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow 15 in areas where cables are spliced the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice when the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with sp should indicate the area of distortion or splice pit authority ocga  2593 2596 2597a2 25912 25913f 46220i and 46230 and gpsc utility rule 5159101  2202014

the visual appearance of the community as a whole as well as the commercial appeal of individual establishments the mission or intent of this requirement is to adopt design standards which over time will establish a streetscape and image that will make the city unique to surrounding jurisdictions establishes a unifying theme presents the traveling public with a sense of arrival is harmonious with its surrounds is aesthetically pleasing and enhances the character of the community as such the following goals at a minimum are established a to encourage the rehabilitation redevelopment of commercial areas b to reinforce and promote the established village center planning concept and associated retail and commercial development c to facilitate and encourage safe attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation and alternate forms of transportation within a development along a corridor and throughout the community d to promote and encourage new development to be compatible in both scale and character with adjoining developments e to use landscaping techniques to soften the effect and blend each development with the surrounding areas f to further energy conservation and stormwater management design g to ensure that quality development throughout the city is obtained development or redevelopment of all retail commercial office andor industrial tracts lying within 500 feet of the centerline of sr 74 or sr 54 or within 500 feet of the centerline of any scenic road community or village collector as defined by this ordinance shall comply with the requirements of this article each new development andor changes to existing development located within these areas shall be reviewed by the planning commission for conformance with these guidelines there shall be no alteration of the existing condition of land uses structures landscaping or lighting within these areas without approval of the planning commission however if a proposed development will not be visible from the road once the project is completed the planning commission may waive review of the development the compatible relationship of each development within these areas is of critical public concern for any building or site enhancements the intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative site planning engineering or architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience the planning commission shall base their review on the guidelines established herein as the sole basis for their review  architectural design the design of all structures walls fences signs light fixtures and accessory buildings shall be unobtrusive and of a design material and color that blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings and the scale of neighboring architecture complying with the intent of this section innovative high quality design and development is strongly encouraged to enhance property values and longterm economic assets along designated corridors diversity of architectural design is highly encouraged however multiple buildings on the same site or within the same development should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings franchise architecture for single or multiple buildings within a development should be avoided in order to create buildings that complement one another franchise architecture is defined as building design that is trademarked or identified with a particular franchise chain or corporation and is generic or standard in nature franchises or national chains should follow the standards of this article to create a building that is compatible with the development in which it is located utilizing similar architectural design building materials or color selections to blend in with the surrounding development architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area design compatibility includes complementary building style form size color materials and detailing the architect should consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process a size the relationship of the project to its site  b scale the relationship of the building to those around it  c massing the relationship of the buildings various parts to each other  d fenestration the placement of windows and doors  e rhythm the relationship of fenestration recesses and projections  f setback in relation to setback of immediate surroundings  g materials their compatibility with the surrounding developments  and h context the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings buildings should incorporate alcoves arcades awnings covered walkways porticoes or roofs that protect pedestrians from the rain and sun in addition when appropriate buildings should incorporate changes in mass surface lighting or finish to emphasize entranceways blank walls that can be seen from any street public or private are prohibited walls shall have offsets jogs or other distinctive changes in the building facade long or continuous wall planes shall be avoided particularly in pedestrian activity areas where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view the height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures especially where buildings will be located very close to each other it is often possible to adjust the height of a wall cornice or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building similar design linkages such as window lines should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings  building height and massing the height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures especially where buildings will be located very close to each other it is often possible to adjust the height of a wall cornice or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building similar design linkages such as window lines should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings the massing of a building can be defined as the overall geometry length width and height of its perceived form massing is a significant factor that contributes to establishing the character of a specific building of particular importance in defining the massing of a building is the overall height of the form both actual and perceived as well as the geometry of the roof in order to reduce the apparent bulk of multistory buildings and maintain pedestrian scale by providing a sense of base middle and top the following guidelines must be met a top the top of the building shall emphasize a distinct profile or outline with elements such as projecting parapets cornices upper level setbacks or pitched rooflines b middle the middle of the building must be made distinct by change in building materials andor color windows balconies recessed panels step backs or other decorative features the middle of a building typically consists of a pattern of upperstory windows c base buildings shall have a distinct base at the ground level by using articulation and materials such as stone masonry or decorative concrete distinction of the base may also be defined by windows alcoves water tables a change in materials texture or color building overhangs canopies awnings or other architectural elements for multistory buildings a base may be one story tall defined by a storefront a cornice or a change in materials the facades of all buildings shall be proportionally divided using architectural elements including windows and entries in conjunction with porches arcades and awnings any wall surface over 30 feet in length should include at least one change in plane larger buildings shall be divided into bays of 25 to 40 foot widths bays can be articulated by pilasters piers differentiation in material texture or color or by variation in the wall plane  2212008 editors note  adopted  repealed the former  726730 and enacted new provisions in lieu thereof formerly  726730 pertained to exterior building materials and architectural elements exterior color selection primary colors accent colors and awnings respectively and derived from adopted  exterior building materials and architectural elements all sides of a building may have an impact on adjoining developments and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials ie brick wood and stone unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used as a general rule front facades should be at least 80 percent brick andor stone side facades should be at least 50 percent brick andor stone rear facades do not have a minimum requirement for primary materials and can consist entirely of secondary materials eg stucco tertiary materials ie wood and metal should be used for decorative elements and trim only the following

building color complements that of its neighbors colors can be classified as the base color used on the majority of the building surface trim color used on the window trim fascia balustrades and posts and accent color used on signs awnings and doors the base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color if natural brick is used it should not be painted  2212008 editors note see note at section 726 primary colors a maximum of three predominant colors should be designated as a primary unifying element accent colors should not be considered predominant colors flexibility may be used to allow additional colors andor a range of predominant colors provided that these colors are in the same family of colors or are similar to each other any color specified as a primary unifying element shall be dominant in the building facade  2212008 editors note see note at section 726 accent colors accent colors may be used as a secondary unifying element provided they are used throughout the development  2212008 editors note see note at section 726 awnings the use of awnings on buildings is encouraged to provide protection from sun wind and rain and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior it is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame covered by a canvas material aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances particularly when integrated into shopping center designs solid colors are preferred over striped awnings but striping is permitted if colors complement the character of the structure or group of buildings awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity where awnings are used they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face awnings on second floor windows can be used to soften the appearance of a particular elevation or to assist in reducing the scale of the overall building  2212008 editors note  adopted  enacted provisions intended for use as  731 inasmuch as there

footnotes  9  editors note adopted nov 4 199 renumbered art xii  1201 and 1202 as art xiii  1301 and 1302 and added a new art xii  12011209 as herein set out purpose and scope the implementation of the master plan for the development of peachtree city has been temporarily disrupted because of delays with the dot project to improve ga 54 to a fourlane arterial thoroughfare between ga 74 and coweta county therefore in order to protect the health safety and general welfare of the community it has been determined to be necessary to adopt the following traffic impact ordinance for the ga 54 corridor the corridor is defined as all that property both north and south of ga 54 between ga 74 and coweta county and extending from the ga 54 rightofway a distance of 6000 feet to the north and 6000 feet to the south the traffic impact ordinance shall establish a minimum standard of traffic operations for the corridor and provide for an administrative process to assure that no development is undertaken that would result in a lowering of the level of traffic operations below that established minimum standard this article shall remain in effect until the dot highway improvements are under contract or upon the gdots refusal to issue further mitigationproject permits      applicability this article shall apply to all development projects in the city for which a development permit has not been issued as of the date of the adoption of this article    traffic impact model the city shall retain a traffic engineering consultant to prepare and maintain a traffic impact model for the corridor the model will be based on the traffic conditions in the corridor at the time the article is adopted the model will then be updated to reflect the impact of each new project that is subsequently approved for development in accordance with this article    acceptable standard of traffic operations the minimum acceptable standard of traffic operations within the corridor shall be defined as follows a for an unsignalized intersection the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 45 seconds b for a signalized intersection the volume to capacity composite ratio shall not exceed 110  and the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 60 seconds c the delays referred to in a and b above shall be calculated according to the methodology described in the highway capacity manual as updated in 1994    traffic impact study a a traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project within the corridor that has access only from ga 54 or is otherwise located within the corridor on a street which ultimately only has access from ga54 b a traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project outside the corridor if that project will generate 100 or more peakhour trips as defined in the institute of transportation engineers ite publication traffic access and impact studies for site development c a traffic impact study must be performed by a qualified traffic engineer d a traffic impact study must be prepared at the expense of the developer of a proposed project e a traffic impact study if required must be performed in accordance with the general guidelines recommended in the ite publication traffic access and impact studies for site development unless otherwise specified in this article or as directed by the city a traffic study must include the projected traffic from all previously approved projects that are not yet in place at the time of the study the extent of the study area must be clearly defined by the developer and approved by the city prior to actually initiating the study and the study must as a minimum include a thorough analysis of the am and pm peakhour traffic over the entire corridor    evaluation and determination each required traffic impact study will be evaluated by the city as to its technical accuracy and its impact on the established minimum standard of traffic operations in the corridor the cost of this evaluation shall be reimbursed to the city by the developer  and each evaluation shall produce a determination that a proposed project either complies with the established standard or it does not comply a if it is determined that a proposed project complies with the established minimum standard of traffic operations for all intersections in the corridor a development permit shall be issued for the project provided it meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances b if it is determined that a proposed project will not comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations at one or more intersections in the corridor the developer may 1 reach an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact the project will have on traffic in the corridor  or 2 delay implementation of the project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with the dot plans  or 3 delay implementation until traffic is reduced in the corridor by other capital improvements to the point where the proposed project is able to comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations within the corridor c if a developer reaches an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact of a project in accordance with b1 above a development permit shall be issued for the project provided the mitigation plan is fully implemented as a part of the permitted work and provided the project including the mitigation plan meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances d if a developer delays implementation of a project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with b2 above a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of the dot improvement work provided the project meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances e if a developer delays implementation of a project in accordance with b3 above a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of other capital improvements that reduce traffic in the corridor to the point where the project is able to comply with the
