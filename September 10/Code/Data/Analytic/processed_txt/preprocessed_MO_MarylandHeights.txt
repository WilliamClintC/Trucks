site minimize concurrent areas of soil disturbance  phase work to the extent practical vegetative cover  for areas not subjected to traffic vegetation provides the most practical method of dust control and should be established as early as possible temporary vegetation should also be used see seeding and sodding bmps for additional information sprinkling  the site can be sprinkled with water until the surface is moist this practice is effective for dust control on large areas haul routes or other traffic routes but constant repetition is required for effective control tilling  roughen the surface and bring clods to the surface this is an emergency measure that should be used before soil blowing starts begin tillage on windward side of the site chisel plows with shanks spaced about 12 inches to 18 inches apart and spring toothed harrows are examples of equipment that may produce the desired effect see surface roughening bmp for additional information wind barriers  solid board fences snow fences burlap fences crate walls and similar materials can be used to control air currents and blowing soil barriers placed at right angles to prevailing wing currents at intervals of about 10 times their height are effective in controlling soil blowing street cleaning  paved areas that have soil on them from construction sites should be cleaned continuously at least daily utilizing a street sweeper or bucket type endloader or scraper mulching  this practice offers a fast and effective means of controlling dust when properly applied binders and tackifiers should be used

erosion and siltation control measures will not remain effective for long periods of time without proper training of inspection staff and effective records of results of inspections it is difficult to determine what maintenance is required the inspector needs to fully understand the swppp the swppp is more than just words and symbols on a piece of paper  it is a blueprint for contractors to follow the inspector must know the implementation schedules know where and when bmps are to be installed know what bmps are to be maintained or eliminated and fully understand the limitations of bmps the contractor needs to be informed by the inspector of any noncompliance or violation issues it is recommended that the inspector meet at least weekly with the contractors to avoid problems that might lead to noncompliance issues also the inspector must be cognizant of hisher responsibilities relative identifying where identifying where modifications to the swppp are needed and recognize when it is necessary to involve owners designers and regulatory personnel in modifications to the swppp or concerns about the operation of the swppp open and regular communication with all companies and agencies is essential the inspector also needs to be aware of appropriate contacts regarding maintenance of bmps or other concerns at some points of the project the developers land development personnel may be the sole contact  at other stages of construction it may necessary to communicate with personnel responsible for building construction general inspection guidelines follow to provide some additional guidance to the inspector these guidelines are provided as a tool for the inspectors use and do not attempt to address all items that can be included on a specific swppp the importance of reporting the results of the inspections and follow up with appropriate personnel cannot be stressed enough general swppp inspection requirements the inspector is responsible for inspecting the site to ensure proper installation operation and maintenance of bmps  performing inspections weekly and within 24 hours of rainfall in excess of 025 inches  determining the overall effectiveness of the swppp  determining the need for additional control measures  promptly notifying the permittee and the site contractors responsible for operation and maintenance of bmps or the deficiencies found during an inspection  notifying the permittee site contractors and the city immediately of any situation requiring immediate action  noting corrective actions taken  forwarding report of inspections to the department within 5 days of inspection the inspector should have detailed knowledge about the site specific swppp particularly the location and type of control measures  the construction requirements for the control measures  spill prevention and cleanup measures  inspection and maintenance record keeping requirements the inspector should determine the following from the inspection the effectiveness of each bmp  the maintenance that needs to be performed on the bmp  the need for revisions to the swppp general items to inspect bmps installed in timely fashion bmps installedperforming

missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one 1 percent chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for st louis county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood  121814 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in subsection 1010a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for
