water conservation by informing the public of ways to conserve water 2the following methods will be used to inform water users anewspaper articles one feature article per year minimum in the henderson daily news  bdirect mailings in the first year of production there will be three direct mailings covering areas of conservation on indoor water use outdoor and lawn watering and plumbing retrofit information in each subsequent year there will be two more direct mailings covering water conservation or specific aspects as required  and cprinted handouts and direct communication with customers new and existing using various pamphlets and printed material of the state water development board american water works association texas water utilities association and information created inhouse will be given to all new customers when they request service  and existing customers when they visit city hall distribution will also be made at citysponsored seminars bsuggestions on ways to save water which may be included in public information are listed below 1bathroom atake a shower instead of a tub bath  showers use less water  binstall a lowflow shower head which restricts water flow at 60 pounds per square inch to not more than three gallons per minute  ctake short showers and install a cutoff valve or turn the water back on again to rinse  ddo not use hot water when cold will do  water and energy can be saved by washing hands with soap and cold water  hot water should only be added if hands are especially dirty  ereduce the level of the water in the bathtub by one or two inches if shower is not available  fturn off water when brushing teeth until time to rinse  gdo not let water run when washing hands  instead hand should be wet water should be turned off while scrubbing and water should be on again to rinse  consider installing a cutoff valve on the faucet  hshampoo hair in shower  it takes only a little more water than is used to shampoo during a bath and much less than shampooing and bathing separately  itest toilets for leaks  to test add a few drops of food coloring to water in the tank do not flush  if coloring appears in the bowl within a few minutes fixture needs adjustment or repair  jhold hot water in the basin when shaving instead of letting faucet continue to run  kuse a toilet tank displacement device to reduce the amount of water in tank but still provide enough for flushing  a onegallon plastic milk bottle can be filled with stones or water recapped and placed in the tank bricks are not recommended for this purpose as the eventually crumble and could damage the working mechanism  these devices should not be used with new lowvolume toilets  linstall faucet aerators to reduce consumption  mnever use toilet to dispose of tissues cigarette butts or other trash  this is a waste of water and places unnecessary load on treatment plants  and ninstall new lowvolume flush toilet when building a new home or remodeling a bathroom 2kitchen ause a pan of water or place a stopper in the sink for rinsing pots and pans when cooking rather than turning on the faucet each time for rinsing items  bnever run a dishwasher without a full load  this saves water expensive detergent and energy  cuse garbage disposal sparingly  never for just a few scraps  dkeep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator  running from tap until cool is a waste  euse a small pan of cold water to clean vegetables rather than letting the faucet run  fuse only a small amount of water in your pots and use a lid for cooking most food  this method will save water and food is more nutritious  and guse a pan of water for rinsing dishes when handwashing rather than running the faucet 3laundry awash only a full load in washing machine  buse lowest possible water level setting for light loads  and cuse cold water as often as possible  save hot water for uses cold water cannot serve 4appliances and plumbing acheck water requirements of any new appliance as models and brands may vary  some will use less water  bcheck all water line connections and faucets for leaks  your money may be going down the drain  clearn to replace faucet washers to correct drips promptly  it is easy costs very little and saves in plumbing and utility bills  dcheck for water leakage between water meter and the house  if indoor and outdoor faucets are all turned off the meter should not run  if it does a leak probably exists and needs to be found  einsulate all hot water pipes to avoid delays and wasted water while waiting for water to get hot  fbe sure hot water heater thermostat isnt set too high  hot settings result in waste of energy and water as it may be mixed with cold water before use  and guse a moisture meter to determine when house plants need water  more plants die from overwatering than from being on the dry side 5outofdoor use awater lawn early in the morning during hot summer months to minimize evaporation  buse a sprinkler which produces large drops rather than a mist to avoid evaporation  cturn soaker hoses so holes are on bottom to avoid evaporation  dwater slowly for better absorption  never in high winds  edo not water streets walks or driveways  fcondition soil with compost before planting grass or flower beds so water will soak in not run off  gfertilize lawn at least twice a year for root stimulation  the better the root system the less water it will require  hlearn to know when grass needs watering  if it has turned a dull graygreen or if footprints remain visible it is time to water  ido not water too frequently  too much water can overload the soil so air cannot get to the roots and can encourage plant diseases  jdo not overwater  soil can absorb only so much moisture the rest simply runs off  one and onehalf inch of water applied once a week will keep most grasses alive  koperate automatic sprinkler system only when the demand on water supply is lowest  set system to operate between  am and  am  ldo not scalp lawn when mowing during hot months as taller grass holds moisture better  muse watering can or handwater with hose in small areas of lawn that need more frequent watering  nlearn what types of grasses shrubbery and plants do best in the area and in which part of the lawn and plant accordingly  oconsider decorating areas of the lawn with rocks gravel wood chips or other materials that require no water at all  pdo not sweep walks and driveways with a water hose  use a broom or rake instead  and quse a bucket of soapy water and use the hose only for rinsing when washing vehicles prior   5403 plumbing codes the city has adopted the 2012 international building 6 gallons per flushing cycle on toilets and insulated hot water pipes these are enforced by the city department which is authorized to issue citations for violations a violation of the code carries a fine of up to $2000 for each violation and every day is a separate violation  provided that no penalty shall be greater or less than the penalty provided under state law prior   5404 retrofit program customers in existing buildings which do not have water saving devices will be encouraged to replace their old plumbing fixtures as the need arises the advertising program will help inform them of the advantages of installing water saving devices the current inverted rate structure should encourage them to be conservative in their water use this type of rate has been in force since  prior   5405 water rate structure a water rate structure which encourages water conservation has been implemented prior   5406 metering athe city currently meters 100% of the customers usage the city has a policy of rereading and then testing all meters which appear to have abnormally high or low water usage incorporated in the water conservation plan the city will set up the following meter testing schedule 1well production meters test every three years  2surface water treatment plant production meter test every year  and 3meters six inch and smaller test or replace when constantly high or constantly low readings are observed bthe city currently uses a computer system which handles all billing requirements and generates water use reports the computer easily identifies dead meters any high or low rate users and keeps track of all water usage prior   5407 water conservation landscaping the advertising program will include suggestions on landscaping and irrigation procedures which will save water usage and money the current rate structure should continue to encourage customers to save water outdoors prior   5408 leak detection and repair athe city currently has a leak detection program which will be maintained bthe program includes 1accounting for water by comparing water production with water billed allowing for internal system use such as back flushing filter overflowing elevated towers and general influshing  2constant monitoring of elevated storage tanks which identify major water main breaks  3visual inspection by meter readers and by city employees who keep a constant watch out for abnormal conditions suggesting leaks  4an adequate maintenance staff which is available to repair any leak  and 5the citys customer service personnel are available to assist customers with leak detection on their premises as well as observing all city distribution facilities prior   5409 implementation and enforcement the water conservation plan will be enforced by the following methods anew service taps will not be given to customers who do not meet the requirements of the water conservation plumbing fixtures codes bthe citys department will handle the enforcement as described in the plumbing the water conservation plan to ensure new buildings are installing the plumbing fixtures that are proposed in the service tap application along with suggestions to citizens and businesses to use the water conservation fixtures when replacing old fixtures cthe current rate structure should encourage retrofitting of old plumbing fixtures which are using large amounts of water people will realize that replacing their fixtures will save them money on their bill both water and sewer prior   5410 recycling and reuse the city has two wastewater plants effluent from these plants is not currently being reused as no economically

of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage prior   15103 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dminimize the prolonged business interruptions  eminimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  fhelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and gensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area prior   15104 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters
