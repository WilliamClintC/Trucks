discussion of subdivision the commission strongly recommends that prior to the submission of an official application for approval of a subdivision or resubdivision the applicant prepare and present a preliminary plan of the subdivision or resubdivision for informal consideration by the commission the preparation of the preliminary plan is recommended to facilitate general consideration of factors and problems affecting development of the land to be subdivided or resubdivided before the applicant proceeds with the official application and the preparation of the final maps plans and documents required for formal consideration by the commission if the subdivision plan is presented in preliminary rather than in final form any alterations or changes recommended by the commission may be made more readily and economically by the applicant neither the preliminary plan nor the informal consideration by the commission however shall be deemed to constitute any portion of the official and formal procedure of applying for or approval of subdivisions or resubdivisions of land as contemplated under the provisions of the general statutes of connecticut this procedure is not a requirement

dedication shall be appropriate in no case shall the commission require more than ten 10 percent of the total subdivision area 1 the dedication of land to the town of durham or another entity approved by the planning and zoning commission such as a land trust or association of the subdivision lot owners  or 2 the preservation of land in the form of scenic or conservation easements  or 3 a combination of the above which the commission may deem appropriate in general the outright dedication of land shall not be required by the planning and zoning commission unless it is adjacent to an existing townowned open space parcel or property dedicated for recreational use if the applicant is able to demonstrate that the open space dedication would reduce the total number of lots in the subdivision that portion of the open space dedication shall be reduced so that the lot yield will not be affected  open space objectives the following objectives should be used as a guide in the general layout of a proposed subdivision containing public or private open space 1 open space conservation areas and recreation areas shown in the towns plan of development should be considered in the

significance as found on the site or as outlined in the towns plan of development should be preserved  3 property adjacent to existing townowned open space or recreation areas should be expanded wherever possible  standards for open space 1 the commission may require open space areas to abut a public street or have direct access to a public street via a rightofway or easement dedicated to public use 2 when a property line of a subdivision abuts an existing park or open space the commission may require new open space lines to be a continuation of the existing open space to form a single large unified area 3 any land dedicated to the town for a public playground or park that is improved for recreational purposes shall be graded to properly dispose of surface water and landscaped in a manner consistent with the intended use all brush and debris shall be removed and the land left in a condition for the purposes intended 4 the commission shall have final approval of the layout of any open space areas to be dedicated to the town 5 all improvements on a parcel to be deeded to the town shall be included in the total amount to be bonded for subdivision improvements  alternative open space dedication 1 if in the judgment of the commission the required open space may be properly and more advantageously located in a future section of a development the commission may grant a delay of this provision provided the developer shall provide preliminary plans and enter into an agreement to dedicate the area of land in the future section for open space the commission shall require a deed or easement to be executed for the land prior to final approval of the subdivision plan if the future section is not planned for development within five 5 years of the date of the subdivision approval the developer shall deed the required open space land to the town either by outright dedication or easement a rightofway providing access to the property shall also be included in the dedication this covenant shall be binding upon the developer and any subsequent owners of the remaining land 4  4 2 open space land to be deeded to the town by either outright dedication or easement need not necessarily be contiguous with the parcel being subdivided other property may be suggested by the developer and accepted by the commission if in the commissions judgment community needs will be better served such land must be in the control of the developer  exceptions the commission may waive the requirements of this section if the minimum total parcel size proposed for subdivision is less than ten 10 acres 0403 lot design building lots should be arranged and located to create and preserve unique characteristics for the building sites to utilize the existing topography to the maximum degree
