alcoa hereinafter referred to as the city makes the following additional findings and conclusions 1 stormwater systems which provide for the collection treatment storage and disposal of stormwater provide benefits and services to all property within the incorporated city limits such benefits include but are not limited to a the provision of adequate systems of collection conveyance detention treatment and release of stormwater b the reduction of hazards to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff 1873 c improvements in general health and welfare of undesirable stormwater conditions d improvements to the water quality in the stormwater and surface water system and its receiving waters 2 an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service fees upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city 3 a utility fee credit is an appropriate means of adjusting fees in recognition that private stormwater systems andor actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city in addition the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors including but not limited to the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system 4 impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater utility fees and associated credits as added by #04042 nov 200

to everyone yes the written regulations provide the regional planning commission with uniform procedures standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plats for land subdivision 2 who is affected by the regulations every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels or changes the size or shape of existing lots 3 am i affected if i subdivide my tract of land into one or two parcels yes subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into one or more lots sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes resubdivision removing or adjusting an existing lot line also constitutes a subdivision 4 whats to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval the county registrar of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivision lying within planning regions without final approval in writing 5 can i sell by an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds no state law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by law to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale 6 what happens if i sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision a a state law has been broken public acts of 1951 b some cloud would exist on the title of the lot c most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans d state law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers water mains lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads e where zoning is in effect a building permit

injunction or other legal action alcoa subdivision regulations 6 revised  7 what improvements will i need to install in my subdivision alcoa subdivision regulations require the developer to grade and improve streets install storm drainage sewers where applicable and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications 8 why doesnt the lot buyer instead of the developer pay for improvements the lot buyer does  at the time he purchases his property if lots are sold before improvements are in the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements that should have been planned for and installed by the developer 9 wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of money quite the contrary property planned subdivisions make the best use of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a maximum number of wellarranged and easier sold lots good land subdivision improves the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor while saving the developer money 10 how do i go about having a subdivision approved the alcoa regional planning commissions printed set of regulations includes the procedure for having a plat approved the planning commission meets at regular intervals and your preliminary sketch plat is submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered it is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area 11 what if i wish to layout a commercial or industrial subdivision the provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivision of land including that for use of business and industry since space parking and service requirements will vary greatly  it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses for that reason specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential areas 12 where can i get technical site planning assistance the planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision alcoa subdivision regulations 7 revised  subdivision regulations of the municipality of alcoa tennessee regionalmunicipal planning commission hereafter referred to as the planning commission article i purpose authority and jurisdiction a purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore to the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards the following subdivision regulations guiding the planning commission are designed the provide for the harmonious development of the planning region  to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provision for light air recreation transportation water drainage sewer and other sanitary facilities b authority these subdivision regulations are adopted under

future of sale or building development and include resubdivision of the land or area subdivided as well as the removal or adjustment of a lot line any prospective subdivider owning land located within

requirements set forth in improvement shall be installed as required by of these regulations alcoa subdivision regulations 8 revised  article ii procedure for plat approval the procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps the initial step is the preparation and subdivision of a concept plan to the planning commission the second step is the preparation

to review a subdivision proposal in a workshop environment in which the developer can discuss his development goals the staff can verbalize their preliminary analysis and the public can express any concerns they may have on the project such a procedure provides the opportunity for the development of an optimal subdivision involving all the necessary parties prior to mounting extensive architectural and engineering costs the resulting preliminary plat is the construction plan for all proposed improvements the final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the county register when duly signed by the secretary of the planning commission a general 1 any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the planning commission wishing to divide such land into two or more lots sites or divisions for the purpose either immediate or future of sale or building development or wishing to resubdivide for this purpose shall submit a plan of such proposed
