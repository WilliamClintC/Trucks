further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks automated teller machines or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who without permission wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections

faced with persons seeking money by offering to open car doors or locate parking spaces c the council is enacting this article pursuant to its police power as stated in of the city charter and florida statutes this law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems d the law is not intended to limit any persons from

continues to grow primarily because it has limited opportunity to widen roadways as a mechanism to increase capacity in a largely builtout environment in order to adequately and efficiently address the citys mobility needs the city of jacksonville beach has replaced transportation concurrency with the mobility fee program the intent of the mobility fee program is to replace the transportation concurrency management system with a holistic mobility approach that applies a fee system to new development based upon the link between land use and mobility through the mobility fee program and this

there is available school capacity in any contiguous concurrency service area 2 for each school type elementary middle and high the school district designee may issue a finding of available school capacity if the following calculation methodology shows that there is available school capacity a formula for total public school facilities total public school facilities   existing public school facilities + planned public school facilities b formula for available school capacity available school capacity   total public school facilities  current student enrollment + student stations reserved

convene a meeting with the applicant or each other if desired to discuss the specific details of the proportionate share mitigation agreement the agreement shall provide mitigation that is at least proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the additional or new residential units in the development proposal and for which there is no available school capacity however this mitigation may not be provided unless it is first accepted by the school district any mitigation that is provided for in a proportionate share mitigation agreement must satisfy the demand created by the additional or new residential units and shall be directed by the school district toward a planned public school facility identified in the work program the school district shall agree

concurrency service area affected by the development proposal the agreed upon mitigation shall be described in an exhibit to the proportionate share mitigation agreement 4 determination of amount of proportionate share mitigation required the amount of proportionate share mitigation required from an applicant shall be calculated by applying the adopted student generation rate multiplier to the cost per student station estimate for each school type elementary middle and high for which there is not sufficient school capacity the minimum proportionate share mitigation obligation for a development proposal shall be determined by the following formulas a formula for number of student stations to be mitigated number of new student stations required for mitigation by school type   available school capacity for the development proposal  number of dwelling units generated by development proposal by housing type  student generation multiplier by housing type and school type b formula for cost of mitigation cost of proportionate share mitigation   number of new student stations required for mitigation by school type  cost per student station estimate by school type the full cost of proportionate share mitigation shall be required from the development proposal 5 cross jurisdictional impact if the approval of additional or new residential dwelling units would result in a failure of public school concurrency within a school district in an adjacent county and the applicant seeks to enter into a proportionate share mitigation agreement the city shall use the formulas set forth in this section to determine the applicants minimum proportionate share mitigation obligation any proportionate share mitigation provided by the applicant shall be directed to the school district in the adjacent county that experiences the failure of public school concurrency 6 impact fee credit the city shall provide a credit for the proportionate share mitigation calculated pursuant
