basis for this chapter the council find as follows a the city is basically for singlefamily residences which have comprised the majority of the housing units in the city b for the last several years the development and construction of multiunit residential complexes predominate particularly condominiumtype complexes c in view of the current market conditions and other realities all studies and information available indicate that this trend will continue d in may cases these developments supplant the properties that previously existed at lower density levels e the city is only approximately five square miles in size and therefore future density increases will occur on territory already populated by a lesser amount of people with services and public facilities geared to that lesser amount f the development and construction of new residential living units within the city creates an immediate and present danger to the existing quality of life and the ecology of the city and threatens to burden and overtax the existing public purposes of the city such as the provisions of public services utilities water and drainage and the treatment and disposal of sanitary sewerage which affects the health welfare and safety of the community g it is further found and determined that the imposition and collection of a nonrecurring fee upon the development and construction of new multiunit residential dwelling units as defined in this chapter is a practical and equitable method of providing revenues with which the city may meet deal with and solve serious problems created by the occupancy and construction of such developments within the city further it is determined that the number of dwelling units tends to be reasonably proportionate to the impact that the development would have on the environment of the city and on the quantity of municipal services required for that development and its cumulative impact on the city 01  definitions for the purpose of this chapter unless

is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  part 1998 variance procedure  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 1998  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood

in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  part 1998  conditions for variances a

responsibilities among a number of persons which rights and responsibilities are not inherent in other types of property ownership with particular effect on master plan concepts elements of the general plan and other related considerations therefore it is the purpose of this chapter a to insure a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing in the city and a variety of individual choices of tenure type price and location of housing and at the same time provide an additional mode of property ownership  b to maintain the supply of rental housing for low and moderateincome persons and families and to provide an additional mode of property ownership  c to reduce and avoid the displacement of longterm residents particularly senior citizens and families with schoolage children who may be required to move from the community due to a shortage of replacement rental housing  d to encourage quality development which will not contribute to the deterioration of the neighborhood  e to encourage a development pattern based upon good land planning principles  f to insure that the conversion of existing developments to condominium ownership be consistent with the protection of the health safety and general welfare of the future occupants of the condominium  g the council finds that the conversion of existing apartment buildings into condominiums diminishes the supply of rental housing and displaces residents and will tend to require them to move outside the city when a housing shortage exists the council finds and declares that when the number of vacant dwelling units in the city is equal to or less than three percent of the total number of dwelling units in the city a housing shortage exists which is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter and with the goals and policies set forth in the housing element of the general plan of the city  and h the council further determines that many of the considerations set forth with reference to

residential and nonresidential uses that enhances and builds upon the citys commercial base  the mixed use overlay zone is not intended to simply act as a loophole in the zoning code for residential development  c to provide additional housing options for people including but not limited to young professionals and older people who want to live near their workplace andor near retail and other nonresidential uses  d to encourage consolidation of small parcels into viable blocksize mixed use development in designated areas  e to ensure onsite compatibility of residential and nonresidential uses  and f to ensure compatibility of mixed use projects with surrounding uses and development patterns  2006  urg   superimposed nature of mixed use overlay zone the mixed use overlay zone shall be in the nature of an overlay zone land classified in the mixed use overlay zone shall also be classified in one or more underlying zones property so classified shall be identified on the zoning map by both the underlying zone and the mixed use overlay zone the regulations set forth in this chapter of the mixed use overlay zone shall be in addition to those regulations set forth in the underlying zone in the event of a conflict between the provisions of the mixed use overlay zone and the provisions of the underlying zone the provisions of the mixed use overlay zone shall prevail when a mixed use project is being developed if the mixed use overlay zone is silent in relation to any development standard the development standard identified in the underlying zone shall prevail  part 2012  2006  urg   special focus areas with application of the mixed use overlay zone the city seeks to take advantage of development opportunities in key areas of the city each of which faces unique opportunities and constraints a description of the desired purpose for four of these areas is described in this section to provide guidance for those seeking to construct mixed use development in such areas a rosecrans avenue corridor generally those parcels abutting rosecrans avenue and those properties north of 145th as shown below land use needs for this area include retail and eating establishments to serve the needs of gardena residents the primary objective for such uses is to provide residents with an attractive alternative to obtaining goods and services in nearby cities b western avenue corridor north generally those parcels abutting western avenue north of redondo beach boulevard and south of 145th as shown below land uses in this area are intended to emphasize office and service uses in combination with attached residential uses the parcel and street configuration of land within this focus area dictates that development will be smaller and potentially more incremental in nature accordingly parcels within each block should be developed as one cohesive project where possible development of multiple blocks as one project is highly encouraged access from existing alleyways will permit rear vehicular access while minimizing curb cuts along western avenue c western addition parcels abutting western avenue north of 169th and south of redondo beach boulevard as shown below by integrating commercial and residential uses including livework buildings this area will function as a transition from the industrially zoned properties to the south to the residentially zoned properties to the north additionally development in this area should respect and relate to the character of the civic center area located nearby the objective for this area is to develop one large or a group of mixed use developments that work together to create a unified sense of place and purpose d dominguez channel approximately twentyacre area bounded by western avenue 178th street and dominguez channel this area provides an opportunity to plan complementary development and defined connections to the artesia corridor specific plan opposite dominguez channel to the north recreational opportunities are anticipated to occur within the dominguez channel easement and consequently adjacent uses should take advantage of this situation by locating parks and open spaces along the dominguez channel edge in addition the dominguez channel area has the opportunity to serve as a gateway to gardena due to its location at the southern border of the city accordingly the objective for this area is also to develop one large or a group of mixed use developments that work together to create a unified sense of place and purpose  part 2012  2006  urg   mixed use in other

public right of way e trim detail on rooflines porches windows and doors on streetfacing elevations are encouraged  8 window placement should reflect the desired exposure appropriate for the respective use a for commercial uses large windows should front onto major pedestrian throughways to promote exposure and visibility b for residential uses windows should face away from loading areas docks and trash storage areas in the occasion that residential windows face one another windows should be offset to maximize privacy c streetscape the following streetscape elements augment architectural styles of the area and promote pedestrian activity these interactive elements enhance usable pedestrian space and decrease the possibility of dead space 1 landscaping is encouraged and should be well maintained and complement the adjacent project a landscaping should be selected at a scale that is consistent with the building site b street landscaping should be appropriate for
