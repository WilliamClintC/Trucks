management practices us environmental protection agency 199 and erosion control design manual minnesota department of transportation et al 1993 2 commissioner means the commissioner of the minnesota pollution control agency or the commissioners designee 3 common plan of development or sale means a contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different times on different schedules but under one proposed plan one plan is broadly defined to include design permit application advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that landdisturbing activities may occur 4 construction activity for this permit construction activity includes construction activity as defined in 40 cfr part 12226b14x and small construction activity as defined in 40 cfr part 12226b15 this includes a disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography existing soil cover both vegetative and nonvegetative or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated storm water runoff leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems examples of construction activity may include clearing grading filling and excavating construction activity includes the disturbance of less than one acre of total land area that is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one 1 acre or more 5 dewatering means the removal of water for construction activity it can be a discharge of appropriated surface or groundwater to dry andor solidify a construction site it may require minnesota department of natural resources permits to be appropriated and if contaminated may require other mpca permits to be discharged 6 energy dissipation means methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion examples include but are not limited to concrete aprons riprap splash pads and gabions that are designed to prevent erosion 7 erosion prevention means measures employed to prevent erosion including but not limited to soil stabilization practices limited grading mulch temporary or permanent cover and construction phasing little canada zoning management 92825 8 final stabilization means that either a all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform eg evenly distributed without large bare areas perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures or equivalent permanent stabilization measures such as the use of riprap gabions or geotextiles have been employed  b for individual lots in residential construction by either a the homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified above or b the homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for and benefits of final stabilization homeowners typically have an incentive to put in the landscaping functionally equivalent to final
