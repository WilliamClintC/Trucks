introduction to these zoning regulations the bristol town plan provides the vision for how bristol should grow and develop all regulations governing land use in the town of bristol stem from the bristol town plan and should serve to implement the visions contained in it the regulations should work in concert to provide a clear fair and efficient administrative process to guide and control development these zoning regulations these regulations constitute the primary regulatory tool by which the town of bristol implements the vision in its town plan they include the flood hazard area regulations and the downtown design review criteria for the area encompassing bristols downtown designation bristol does not have subdivision regulations for any given application only a portion of these regulations will apply these regulations are intended to be comprehensive and are organized to clarify the review process before the zoning administrator planning commission or zoning board of adjustment how to use these regulations this introduction is intended to help the applicant and the public understand how these regulations function and to help an applicant and other parties interested in the application understand the development permit process in bristol of this document contains the general administrative framework for the regulations it is designed to provide general information regarding the purpose of the regulations and how the regulations function it provides overall context but is less important to individual applications than other ii which establishes the zoning districts constitutes the functional heart of the document it is generally the best place for anyone considering an application to start reviewing the regulations the zoning map establish a zoning district for each portion of town the uses that will be allowed in each district and specific setback and other regulations governing where uses may take place on a specific parcel applicants should use the zoning map and text in to determine in which zoning district their parcel lies once they have identified the district they should review the regulations to identify the types of uses or development allowed in the district to determine whether their desired use or development is allowed in the district and if so what procedure they will need to follow to apply next they should determine the specific dimensional setbacks that govern where the use or development sits on the property lastly they should look for references to other portions of these regulations that apply to their proposed use governs the permitting process an applicant will need to go develop or use their property in the manner proposed in their application starts by listing exempt uses or development not subject to these regulations and therefore not requiring a permit if the use or development an applicant plans is not exempt it will require a permit the applicant will need 8 to read or speak with the zoning administrator to determine the process they need to follow to apply for a permit these regulations have two general review processes an administrative review process for uses listed as permitted uses within the district are specifically given to the zoning administrator to review  or a more complicated review process for commercial uses or larger development proposals conducted by the planning commission or zba bodies that act in deciding whether a permit application satisfies these regulations in all cases once an applicant has developed an idea of what they would like to do where in bristol they desire to do it and whether or not it is exempt from zoning the best place for an applicant to start is with the zoning administrator the zoning administrator serves as the front door for all zoning subdivision or flood hazard area development or uses in the town of bristol in addition to reviewing specific applications the zoning administrator must also help applicants to understand and develop a proper application to request the type of use or development they are proposing and direct the applicant to the proper review process lastly also establishes the hearing requirements for all applications going before the planning commission or zba although applicants may apply for different development or uses these regulations are intended to ensure that each applicant and all people interested in the application receive consistent and fair treatment constitute required general specific and performance related zoning regulations that govern types of uses and development or specified uses each may or may not apply to any given application applicants are encouraged to review them thoroughly or speak about them specifically with the zoning administrator governs the application and review criteria for building within the flood hazard zone within bristol provides definitions contained within these regulations in drafting these regulations the planning commission sought to provide a consistent fair and unified process to regulate land development over previous rounds of zoning bristol has changed standards causing a small number of properties to have their historical uses classified as preexisting and nonconforming in the zones in which they are located if owners of such grandfathered properties should subsequently request changes or expansions compatible with their original uses and scale these regulations encourage the appropriate municipal panel to work with the landowner to reach flexible solutions that meet the needs of the owners and protect the overall character of the zone the planning commission sought to balance its respect for an individuals property rights with regulations intended to implement the communitys desire for proper growth and development as envisioned in the town plan thank you the bristol planning commission 9 article i enactment intent and organization enactment in accordance with the vermont

bpc a objectives and guidelines bristol pond constitutes a unique physical feature within the town of bristol it supports low density outdoor recreational uses including fishing hunting birding and canoeing or kayaking it hosts several species of rare and endangered plants and some of the oldest known archeological sites in the state of vermont most of the pond is surrounded by open undeveloped land that largely constitutes floodplain and marsh on which development is prohibited the only portion of land adjacent to the pond that has any development currently consists of the 15 preexisting nonconforming small camp lots commonly known as the lake winona landowners association the primitive or seasonal camps or vacant lots that currently compose the district are small and many lack basic services like running water or functioning wastewater systems beyond an outhouse the bristol pond camp district constitutes a new district encompassing the 15 small lots that compose the lake winona landowners association and is surrounded by the conservation district which encompasses the remainder of bristol pond the bristol pond camp district has two primary objectives first like the neighboring conservation district it is intended to protect the scenic natural and historic qualities that make bristol pond unique second it seeks to acknowledge the preexisting primitive or seasonal camps and lots that exist on the pond and to allow for very limited and appropriate improvements to those camps or lots in order to accomplish each of the objectives noted immediately above the district offers the following guidelines controlling any new development in the district 1 no further subdivision of any lot will be allowed within the district 2 only one single family dwelling unit will be allowed on each lot 3 yearround homes are prohibited in the district 4 primitive camps with no interior plumbing consisting of more than a sink with water will be allowed provided they are used for no more than 3 consecutive weeks per year and no more than a total of 60 days per year however owners that can demonstrate that they use the camp more than the timeframe above and that the current level of use existed before  will be allowed to continue using the camp at the level of use established prior to  this date is significant as that use means that the camp is exempt from the permit requirements of the state wastewater system and potable water supply rules under the clean state exemption the purpose of this guideline is to create a local permitting regime consistent with the state wastewater and potable water supply requirements and exemptions 5 seasonal camps whether or not they have internal plumbing that are used for 180 days per year or less will be allowed existing seasonal camps will be allowed to continue at the current level of use if the owner can demonstrate that the current level of use existed before  this date is significant as that use means that the camp is exempt from the permit requirements of the state wastewater system and potable water supply rules under the clean state exemption the purpose of this guideline is to create a local permitting regime consistent with the state wastewater and potable water supply requirements and exemptions 6 applicants applying for a zoning permit for any improvements or additions like adding bedrooms or making any other changes that would require a state wastewater system and potable water supply permit understand that that the town of bristol will condition the issuance of a final zoning permit upon the applicants securing a state permit 7 no new structures may be erected within 100 feet of the shoreline of bristol pond as measured from the mean high water mark however preexisting camps closer to the pond than 100 feet may add rooms or other improvements to the camp but only if the proposed addition is no closer 28 to the pond and can meet the dimensional setback requirements for locating the addition on the side of the structure or on the portion of the structure furthest away from the pond 8 each lot shall maintain a native vegetative buffer of at least 100 feet from the mean high water mark along the majority of the shoreline of the pond that the lot encompasses native vegetative buffers including trees shrubs or other understory plants and a duff layer of leaf litter and woody debris provide a number of environmental functions that benefit the pond and the wildlife that use the pond for drinking water and habitat trees and shrubs can help screen properties from the other users of the pond preserving a pristine experience they also provide cover for terrestrial species that use the pond for drinking water their root systems help bind the soil slowing and filtering runoff preventing erosion and maintaining water quality the duff layer also serves too slow and filter runoff improving water quality lastly trees shrubs and duff contribute woody debris and associated insects and plants necessary to maintain the health of the near shore aquatic habitat which supports the reproduction of many aquatic species accordingly bristol requires that each property owner along the pond serve as a steward of the ponds resources both for themselves and for the general public maintaining a natural vegetative buffer within 100 feet of the pond for a majority of the lot frontage on the pond can look a number of different ways guidelines for implementing the buffer follow a the duff layer is most important and should be maintained in nearly all areas within 25 feet of the pond  b areas of trees and shrubs should be preserved but may be thinned or limbed to provide viewsheds from the property to the pond leaving the trees upper stories intact to provide shade and screening  c grass or lawn areas should comprise a minority of the area of the shoreline decreasing in size closer to the waterline  9 accessory usesbuildings will be permitted provided they
