businesses in order to protect the general health safety and welfare and to control certain land uses that may have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the citys residential and commercial neighborhoods  findings of the city council the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to license sexuallyoriented businesses the findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located as studied by a city staff committee it is apparent from that review and the data compiled by staff that there are a number of issues that must be addressed a sexually oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending state licensed family day care home state licensed group family day care homes and state licensed childcare centers  student attending school  and people using public parks and libraries b sexuallyoriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity the experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses can however minimize this risk provided the owners and operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures c sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which such businesses are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents d the concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of life in the community a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexually oriented businesses the presence of such businesses is often perceived by others as an indication that the community or area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating to other businesses that may be required to move out of the vicinity and which could influence residents to relocate from the area it has been noted that the presence of such businesses can have the overall effect of causing declining real estate values which result can be exacerbated by the concentration of such businesses which can erode the city s tax base and contribute to overall community blight e sexuallyoriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids for which currently there is no cure experiences of other cities indicate that such businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises thereby endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the general public f sexuallyoriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food andor drink on the same premises  conclusions of the city council in direct furtherance of the substantial goals of public
