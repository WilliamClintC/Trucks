decisions including the specific studies and findings contained therein as to the negative secondary effects resulting from the location and concentration of adult business uses within a municipality 1 st paul division of planning at the minnesota crime control planning board  1978 study of relationships between sexually oriented and alcohol oriented adult entertainment business  2 minnesota crime prevention center study on the effects of sex oriented and alcohol oriented adult entertainment upon property values and crime rates  1980  3 indianapolis  1983 study of sexually oriented businesses

supreme court of wash 1978 90 wash 2d 709 585 p2d 1153 b the village finds that the negative secondary effects associated with adult business uses as adopted pursuant to subsection a of this section are applicable to the location of adult business uses in the village and that the regulation of adult business uses is necessary to lessen said negative secondary effects including but not limited to lessening the following negative secondary effects 1 there is a statistically significant correlation between the location of adult business uses and neighborhood deterioration 2 that the location of an adult business use in a neighborhood has a negative impact on property value  sterling codifiers inc  415568 3 that the negative impact on property values increases when more than one adult business use is located within a given area 4 that the effect of adult business uses on the crime rate is positive and significant 5 that there is a significantly higher crime rate associated with two 2 adult businesses located in a given area than is associated with only one adult business use in a given area 6 that adult business uses should be located in areas of the village which are not in close proximity to residential uses schools and other retail business uses as well as areas frequented by minors 7 that residents of the village and persons who are nonresidents but use the village for shopping and other needs will move from the village or shop elsewhere if adult business uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential dwellings schools or other retail business uses 8 that the location of adult business uses in a given area creates the perception in the village that such area is an unsafe and undesirable part of the village therefore adult business uses should be separated from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself the reasonable regulation of the location of adult business uses will provide for the protection of the image of the village and its property values and protect the residents of the village from the negative secondary effects of such business uses while
