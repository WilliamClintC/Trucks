delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of blakely georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increase in flood heights and velocities c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion and  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters d objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life and health  547 2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas 4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions and  7 to insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area general provisions a lands to which this

wisconsin  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota  and the final report of the attorney generals commission of pornography the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this adult theaters and adult dance establishments engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially in those which provide private or semiprivate 1229 booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented business 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency virus caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  and 8555 in 1985 8 as of december 2002 there had been 26008 reported cases of aids in the state of georgia making georgia the ninth highest state in the country for cumulative aids cases 9 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reports annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  10 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 11 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because 1230 of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and those operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the area of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 15 the findings in subsections 1 14 raise substantial governmental concerns 16 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 17 a reasonable licencing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the license is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 18 removal of the doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 19 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 20 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in the preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 21 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who 1231 are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 22 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 24 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this definitions the following terms used in this chapter defining adult entertainment establishments shall have the meanings indicated below a adult
