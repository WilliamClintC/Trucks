collected for the operation maintenance and replacement of the wastewater collection and transport system replacement generally refers to equipment which has a useful life of less than 20 years c each user must pay its proportional share of the operation maintenance and replacement cost of the wastewater collection and transport system based on the users proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users d the sewer user charge system model uses categories of costs associated with the operation maintenance replacement and debt retirement costs related to the wastewater collection and transport system actual cost from the previous fiscal year records are used to calculate a rate per sewer unit charge required to fully fund the next fiscal years operation maintenance replacement and debt retirement needs the resulting rate per sewer unit charge will be adopted by resolution of the city council after appropriate public notice and hearing pursuant to the authority of section 86138 e the rate per sewer unit charge will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that it is accurate and the resulting rate will be calculated by the following formula and

rev 815 i the exceptional narrowness shallowness or shape of a specific property  ii the exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or manmade constraints or other extraordinary situation on

district designation the board may require submission of documentation from real estate or market experts or a certified appraiser to substantiate this finding 2 unique circumstances the need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties in the same zoning district the applicant must prove that there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment in those situations where the difficulty is shared by others the board may find that relief should be accomplished by an amendment to the zoning ordinance not a variance 3 not selfcreated the problem and
