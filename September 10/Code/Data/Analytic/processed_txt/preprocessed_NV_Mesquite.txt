property 2 the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 3 while the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than onehalf acre deviations from that limitation may occur however as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases 4 variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 5 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 6 variances should only be granted when it would otherwise result in an exceptional hardship to the applicant b variances from any provision of the regulations may be granted as a minimum under the conditions specified by fema and shall consider all technical evaluations delineated in these regulations in addition to 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  4 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing

emergency vehicles  7 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site c variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and that the variance is the minimum

discharge would result  entity and district responsibilities a the entity shall be the primary review agency for all variances requested from their ordinance variances shall only be granted upon finding 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances  sterling codifiers inc  293565 b in those cases where granting the variance has regional flood control significance including special flood hazard areas section  the entity shall

capacity for the proposed development the applicant for any development projected to generate more than five hundred 500 vehicle trips per day shall submit a traffic impact analysis 2 level of service definitions in general the various levels of services are defined as follows for uninterrupted flow facilities a level of service a represents free flow individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely high the general level of comfort and convenience provided to the motorist passenger or pedestrian is excellent b level of service b is in the range or stable flow but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected but there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from los a the level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less than at los a because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior c level of service c is in the range of stable flow but marks the beginning of the range of flow in which the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in the traffic stream the selection of speed is now affected by the presence of others and maneuvering within the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of the user the general level of comfort and convenience declines noticeably at this level d level of service d represents high density but stable flow speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and convenience small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this level e level of service e represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level all speeds are reduced to a low but relatively uniform value freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to give way to accommodate such maneuvers comfort and convenience levels are extremely poor and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high operations at this level are usually unstablebecause small increases in flow or minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns f level of service f is used to define forced or breakdown flow this condition exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount which can traverse the point queues form behind such locations operations within the queue are characterized by stop and go waves and they are extremely unstable vehicles may progress at reasonable speeds for several hundred feet or more then be required to stop in a cyclic fashion level of service f is used to describe the operating conditions within the queue as well as the point of the breakdown it should be noted however that in many cases operating conditions of vehicles or pedestrians discharged from the queue may be quite good nevertheless it is the point at which arrival flow exceeds discharge flow which causes the queue to form and level of service f is an appropriate designation for such points b design 1 generally the standards established by this section shall apply to all public and private roads in the city the master plan shall serve as a guide for the location and scale of future arterial and collector streets 2 classification all city streets shall be classified as either an arterial major collector minor collector local or residential roadway any street that is not already classified in the master plan shall be classified by the

maintenance a no road or street shall be accepted by the city unless it meets the design standards established by these regulations and all other design standards established by ordinance or law b dedication of half streets will not be approved except where it is essential to the reasonable development of a subdivision and in conformity with all other requirements of these regulations or where

dedication of reserve strips shall not be approved c traffic impact analysis guidelines 1 purpose traffic impact studies have the ability to help the city of mesquite in forecasting additional traffic stemming from a proposed development it is important to note that by requiring a traffic impact study the city can protect the substantial investment it has in the transportation infrastructure these studies have potential to help decide what improvements if any need to be made to the surrounding transportation system with the addition of the proposed project the city may utilize these studies to determine effective land use planning and resource allocation identify potential problems reduce negative impacts and provide clear direction to city decision makers the main purpose of the traffic impact analysis is to determine reasonable traffic conditions and to mitigate issues helping to maintain safety on the citys transportation system 2 implementation statement the city of mesquite desires to operate a safe and efficient transportation system the management of access to the system in an effective manner is vital to maintaining the overall safety and efficiency of the system development of a site whether new construction or redevelopment of an existing site has an effect on the surrounding area these guidelines present a detailed process and set of requirements for completing a traffic impact study with the goal of minimizing the potential negative effects of new development and to determine essential modifications or improvements to be made to the existing and future transportation system within the city of mesquite the procedures outlined in these guidelines present the minimum information required to conduct a traffic impact analysis tia the preparer of
