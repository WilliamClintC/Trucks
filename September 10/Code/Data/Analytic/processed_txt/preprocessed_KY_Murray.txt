therefore the city council hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance as follows passed 92310  15202 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 92310  15203 statement of purpose ait is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters  4control tilling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas bthe objectives of this chapter are to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding  and 7ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood

criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bdesignation of variance and appeal board the city council of murray shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of zoning adjustment cduties of variance and appeals board 1the board of zoning adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances

result 2variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the board of zoning adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the board of zoning adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the
