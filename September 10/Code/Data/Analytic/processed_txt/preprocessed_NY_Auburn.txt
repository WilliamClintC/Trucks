city of auburn comprehensive plan and other city planning and development initiatives downtown is the citys financial entertainment governmental and institutional center for public services social activity and employment as such the intent of this section is to maintain the distinctive character of downtown and enhance relationships between buildings and streets and other public spaces by considering their visual compatibility with surrounding areas b guiding principles these standards are based upon a number of guiding principles including to 1 implement the city of auburn comprehensive plan  2 protect and reinforce the unique and historic character of downtown neighborhoods  3 encourage adaptive reuse and desirable forms of development at infill locations and underutilized properties   30522 water protection of  30523  4 reestablish walkability and strengthen the historic circulation patterns of walkable areas  5 encourage reinvestment and revitalization

mixeduse core and gateway areas as discussed in this chapter both are evolving over time in terms of development scale density type and intensity of use the downtown core is the centralized mixeduse business area of the city with a concentrated mix of land uses at higher densities of building development and vertical scale than other areas of the city the core is an area of high development interest often focused at or near the crossroads of major thoroughfares the core contains some of the most important landmarks civic places and historic sites in auburn 2 the downtown gateway areas are generally those neighboring peripheral areas that transition from the higher intensities of use and the more traditional urban forms found in the core to somewhat lower densities less variability in land use and noticeable changes in visual character the gateways are generally along thoroughfares leading into downtown adjacent to neighboring zoning districts where land use transitions to residential neighborhoods and nonresidential uses that begin to exhibit characteristics of urbansuburban areas with obvious changes in building types architectural styles lot sizes and pedestrian activity along mostly commercial corridors f organization of building types 1 this section is organized by building types found within the downtown district in the downtown district eight building types have been identified see table f1 building type should not be confused with building use or architectural style each building type is associated with information specific to that type including its general size height and similar form and design characteristics  30523 water protection of  30523  2 this chapter includes dimensional and building form standards dimensional standards include lot size and setback requirements building form standards relate to the overall size and shape of buildings including massing and scale relative to their surroundings this chapter provides standards applicable to all building types as well as standards that only apply to a specific building type table f1 identifies where each type is permitted within the downtown core and each of the four downtown gateway areas table f1 downtown building types downtown building types downtown mixed use core northern gateway southern gateway eastern gateway western gateway civic and institutional p p s

 30523  a description civic and institutional buildings are typically unique in building form and architectural style often providing visually distinct public gathering places that are highly visible from the public realm particularly primary thoroughfares in auburn the most prominent civic buildings are government office buildings and courthouses institutional buildings may be operated by private or public institutions and notforprofit organizations these buildings may be dedicated to a single purpose such as public safety social services cultural activities and education in some cases transitrelated facilities such as public parking structures are considered civic buildings as prominent features in the urban landscape the design of civic and institutional buildings is critical to enhancing community character in the downtown district b intent it is the intent of the design standards for civic and institutional buildings to be used on a casebycase basis to create functional and visually memorable civic and institutional buildings with design features that help establish a sense of place in downtown auburn it is important that these buildings are consistent with the visual characteristics and the context of surrounding neighborhoods and nearby buildings without sacrificing the uniqueness of their design c additional standards applicable to this building type  building alignment and setback shall vary with building location lot size and intended use but shall not exceed 15 times the average of the setbacks of immediately adjacent buildings  the placement of the building on the property shall highlight its visual character and intended use  where civic buildings are located that terminate a vista such as along the centerline of a thoroughfare the primary facades shall be designed to include a significant architectural building andor open space feature along the axis of the vista  pedestrian areas and circulation on the grounds shall be welllandscaped and visually distinct from vehicular areas parking and vehicular circulation shall not dominate views from the public realm in the front of the building or from major streets nearby 2 multistory commercialoffice buildings  30523 water protection of  30523  a description within the city of auburn multistory commercial office buildings are typically large structures generally consisting of two to six stories with vertical mixed uses that may include groundfloor retail office or commercial services and upperfloor office or residential use these buildings are on large lots and may visually dominate a downtown block and one or more corners they may be owned by one or more entities and can be divided into separate uses these buildings are often an important center of employment and substantially contribute to the urban streetwall and pedestrian activity parking may be incorporated into the structure b intent it is the intent of the design standards for multistory commercialoffice buildings that because of their relatively large size reuse potential and adaptability to a variety of uses this building type exhibits a traditional urban rectangular form and an almost timeless or classic appearance in architectural style colors and materials 3 main street mixeduse buildings a description main street mixeduse buildings are generally small to mediumsize in scale typically two to four stories with groundfloor retail services or other commercial uses and upperfloor residential or office space in their more traditional form these buildings are frequently attached to one another or other structures by a common wall helping to define a highly unified streetscape detached buildings may be a remnant of past similar uses on the block and may provide opportunities for infill development the ground floor emphasizes transparency and is comprised of larger storefronttype windows and doors with smaller windows in upper floors these buildings may include a corner shopfront there is a distinct rhythm to window patterns and these buildings typically exhibit a compatible variety of building materials colors and textures b intent it is the intent of the design standards to protect and preserve auburns existing stock of pedestrianscaled mixeduse buildings that define most of the rich visual character of downtown these buildings are highly adaptable to a variety of  30523 auburn code  30523  uses over time and promote a healthy pedestrian environment consistent with a walkable city emphasis shall be placed on their adaptive reuse redevelopment infill development opportunities and preservation over new forms of development on the same site 4 midrisehighrise buildings a description midrise to highrise buildings are medium to largescale highdensity structures on large lots comprised of multiple stories generally dedicated to a single purpose such as residential use or mixeduse consisting of ground level retail personal services and office use with upper floor residential units surface andor structure parking may be provided midrise buildings are typically four to eight stories and highrise buildings are nine to 12 stories or more in height b intent it is the intent of the design standards for this building type to permit their development in suitable locations that are visually compatible with the surrounding neighborhood particularly with regard to their scale height and massing dwelling units in these structures are intended to provide residents with opportunities to walk to nearby neighborhood services to meet daily and personal needs c additional standards applicable to this building type  roofs on most midrise and highrise buildings are typically flat due to their overall height and massing the top floor at the roofline of the primary and side facades may include decorative elements such as changes in materials or color to highlight the structure  side and rear facades shall receive the same treatments in terms of building materials windows and colors as the primary facade entries to ground floor uses and dwelling  30523 water protection of  30523  units may be accessed from the sides or rear of the building 5 small shopfrontresidence buildings a description shopfront buildings are generally small attached or detached buildings having one owner and typically set on relatively small lots the ground floor is flexible space able to adapt to a variety of shopfront uses and may contain retail or commercial services with a rear or upper floor residence or office these buildings may function as livework buildings and are typically located in medium or moderatedensity areas the buildings main entrance typically faces the primary street and there may be a separate entry for the upper floor b intent it is the intent of the design standards for the shopfront residence building type to protect and preserve their unique architectural styles and ability to adapt to the space requirements of small businesses and neighborhood uses c additional standards applicable to this building type  the building shall be aligned with adjacent building fronts on primary streets typically with a very narrow or zero setback and buildto lines along side streets  buildings shall be brought forward to the property lines of adjacent streets storefronts and primary entryway to the ground floor is along the primary street upper floor entries may be along the primary andor side streets  rooflines may include trim and color accents 6 commercial franchise and branch office buildings  30523 auburn code  30523  a description commercial franchise and branch office buildings are typically small to mediumsize on correspondingly sized lots that allow for surface parking these buildings tend to be more autooriented than others in the downtown district and their placement on a lot typically emphasizes maximum visibility building design and colors may exhibit identifiable logos and commercial brand characteristics  to the extent that nontraditional branded colors are featured in the building design these should not be a primary element of the facade buildings are typically one to two stories in height and principal uses generally confined to the ground floor offstreet parking is typically provided on the property these buildings may contain office space and are wellsuited to daily or personal care services and may include uses such as banks  restaurants  specialty retail  and office buildings b intent it is the intent of the design standards for commercial franchise and branch office buildings to encourage compatible development with adjoining buildings and nearby residential neighborhood uses particularly in transitional areas beyond the core of downtown auburn c additional standards applicable to this building type  pedestrian circulation on the grounds shall be welllandscaped and visually distinct from vehicular areas parking and vehicular circulation shall not dominate views from the public realm in the front of the building or from major streets nearby  pitched roofs may be most appropriate in transitional edge areas adjacent to residential
