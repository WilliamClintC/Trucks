the city this section enables the city to protect public health in conformity withadministrative provisions water quality requirements and other discharge criteria which are requiredor authorized by local state and federal law the objectives of this section are as follows to regulate the construction and use of public and private sewers and drains to provide for annexations and connections to the public sewerage system to provide a means of determining wastewater volumes constituents and characteristics and toissue permits to certain users to set limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters dischargedto the system to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater treatment facilities whichwill interfere with the normal adequate treatment in the wastewater facilities pass into the receiving waters or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge to recover from users of the wastewater treatment facilities on an equitable basis the share ofthe wastewater treatment facilities costs attributable to such users and to provide funds for theoperation and maintenance debt retirement and replacement of the wastewater facilities to set penalties for violations of the requirements of this article and to set forth collection ofnonpayment of bills  45514 abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this article to repeal abrogate annul impair or interfere with any existingeasements covenants deed restrictions agreements rules regulations ordinances or permitspreviously adopted or issued pursuant to law however wherever this article imposes greaterrestrictions the provisions of this article shall govern  45515 interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimumrequirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the utility and shall not be deemed a limitationor repeal of any other power granted by the statutes of the state of wisconsin  45516 revenues and rate design users of the oconto falls wastewater treatment system shall be charged a rate which will recover allcosts of operation and maintenance replacement fund deposits and debt retirement costs the rateshall be determined on a cost of service basis and shall be reviewed annually to determine if the totalrevenue is sufficient to cover all of the aforesaid costs the rate shall be such that a proportionatedistribution of all costs is charged to each user class user volume charge it is assumed that biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solidsphosphorous and other pollutant concentrations discharged to the sewer system from all userclassifications are approximately equal and proportional to volume therefore the user chargeswill be developed on a volume basis in accordance with the following formula users volumecharge per 1000 cubic feet cu for operation and maintenance and replacement costs is equal tothe total annual cost ct of operation and maintenance and replacement costs divided by the totalvolume contribution vt in thousands of cubic feet from all users annually thus cu   ctvt ctand vt shall not include the ii component the user volume charge shall be paid monthly  city of oconto falls wi ecode360  228309 b 1 2 3 c a b c 1 2 d e 1 2 3 f a b c fixed user charge the fixed user charge includes debt retirement costs the fixed user charge isallocated to each sewer user according to a fixed charge for each water meter size the fixed usercharge is divided by the total number of user charge meter equivalents ucme in the sewerservice area the fixed user charge shall be paid monthly surcharge rate a surcharge shall be added to the volume charge to any users whose wastewaterpollutant concentrations exceed those of normal domestic sewage as determined by a calculationusing the wwtp influent loadings and water use discharged to the sewer system the followingunit surcharge costs are hereby established suspended solids greater than 367 parts per million ppm $086 per pound bod greater than 396 ppm $088 per pound phosphorus p greater than 75 ppm $646 per pound total user charge the wastewater user charge shall be billed monthly and shall be the sum of the user volume charge fixed user charge a surcharge as applicable to allow for typical domestic summer water consumption which does not reach the disposalsystem lawn and garden watering etc the utility will use second quarter meter readings forcomputing third quarter bills whenever third quarter volumes exceed second quarter volumes annual review the revenue generated by the user charge system will be reviewed annually foradequacy and the rates will be adjusted when required accounting all user charge moneys shall be placed in the sewage disposal account to cover the costs ofoperation and maintenance replacement fund deposits and debt retirement payments expenditures shall be made from the account by the city administrator  clerktreasurer inaccordance with the detailed annual budget prepared by the sewage disposal commission a replacement reserve account shall be established and expenditures from it shall be only formaking renewals to accommodate wear of
