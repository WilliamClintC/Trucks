criteria in this chapter shall be used for purposes of classifying streets within the city res 130 1972  major arterials  traffic service provided major arterials provide for movement across and between large subparts of an urban region and serve predominantly trips with minimum direct service to abutting land uses res 130 1972  major arterials  grouping of traffic generators major arterial service is required by mediumtolarge central business districts most municipal airports large shopping centers large colleges and universities large industrial plants major governmental centers large hospitals important secondary business districts major rail and seaport terminals and similar land uses which comprise the top layer of the hierarchy of trip generators res 130 1972  major arterials  spacing major arterials will seldom be closer than one mile apart in even the most densely developed urban regions in practice it is expected that for most urban areas in washington spacing of major arterials will be wider moreover spacing will vary within any given urban area with major arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban rural boundary res 130 1972  major arterials  route continuity major arterials shall form a closed interconnected system linking together major traffic generators in urban areas stub end arterials are not normally classified as major arterials res 130 1972  secondary arterials  traffic service provided secondary arterials provide for movement within the large subparts proscribed by major arterials secondary arterials may also serve but provide very much more direct service to abutting land uses than do major arterials res 130 1972  secondary arterials  grouping of traffic generators secondary arterial service is required by small central business districts and traffic generators as listed above for major arterials except that such generators will be smaller plus high schools and some grade schools strip commercial development parks and lowuse intensity recreational areas warehousing areas and similar land uses which comprise the middle layer of the trip generator hierarchy res 130 1972  secondary arterials  spacing secondary arterial streets will seldom be closer than onehalf mile from another secondary or major arterial street in practice it is expected that for most urban areas in the state of washington the spacing of arterial streets will be wider moreover spacing will vary within any given urban area with secondary arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban rural boundary res 130 1972  secondary arterials  route continuity secondary arterials shall wherever possible be long continuous streets with direct rather than meandering alignments res 130 1972  collector arterials  traffic service provided collector arterials provide for movement within the smaller areas which are often definable neighborhoods and may be bounded by higher class arterials collector arterials serve very little traffic but serve a high proportion of local traffic requiring direct access to abutting land uses res 130 1972  collector arterials  grouping of traffic generators collector arterial service is required for the majority of the nonresidential land uses which generate measurably important traffic volumes and which are not served by major or secondary arterials res 130 1972  collector arterials  spacing collector arterials will seldom be closer than onefourth mile from any other arterial street in practice it is expected that for most urban areas in the state the spacing of arterial streets will be wider moreover spacing will vary within any given urban area with collector arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban rural boundary res 130 1972  collector arterials  route continuity collector arterials need not be particularly long or continuous since this would tend to attract in unduly high proportions

affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in wmc 1 and 2c g such defense requires the user to prove to the satisfaction of the director that athe user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference  bthe discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit  and cin the case of interference the user was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 2this defense may relieve the user from responsibility for enforcement to recover costs as provided under wmc    upset 1users shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the

pursuant to rcw 3670a060 and washougal this chapter is known as the washougal critical areas ordinance 2as provided herein the director is given the authority to interpret and apply and the responsibility to enforce this chapter to accomplish the stated purpose the city may withhold condition or deny development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with this chapter 3when any provision of this chapter or any existing regulation easement covenant or deed restriction conflicts with this chapter that which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply 4the director to the extent practical shall review development for compliance with critical area regulations with the triggering development application where there are no triggering applications determination of the type of application shall be based upon the criteria in table 1 5determinations of compliance with this chapter shall be appealed along with the decision on the underlying permit application to the hearing examiner   purpose the purpose of the critical areas overlay district is to implement the policies of the washougal comprehensive plan this chapter creates an overlay district that requires the conservation andor enhancement of identified critical areas while encouraging urban densities and affordable housing transfer to nonsensitive buildable lands the washougal comprehensive plan is designed to accommodate a 20year supply of buildable residential commercial and industrial lands where the effects of this chapter render private property unbuildable the city will encourage the use of public and private strategies that balance protection or enhancement of critical areas against the citys adopted developmentrelated comprehensive plan policies critical areas are valuable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints that in their natural state provide many valuable social and ecological functions the attendant buffers of critical areas are essential to the maintenance and protection of the functions and value of important critical areas the loss of social and ecological functions provided by critical areas especially wetlands riparian zones and fish and wildlife habitat results in a detriment to public safety and welfare critical areas help to relieve the burdens on the people of washougal which urban development can create including congestion noise and odors air pollution and water quality degradation critical areas can filter and clean surface waters refresh the air we breathe and provide open space areas that help add variety and texture to the urban landscape critical areas serve several important urban design functions they provide 1 open space corridors separating and defining developed areas within the city  2 views which enhance property values and quality of life in developed neighborhoods  3 educational opportunities for the citizens of washougal  and 4 accessible areas for residents to stroll hike and enjoy washougals valuable natural features conservation of critical areas has associated natural resource benefits including improved air and water quality maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat decreased erosion and sedimentation of streams absorption of pollutants and preservation of rare plant and animal species the intent of this overlay district is at a minimum to achieve no net loss of wetlands floodplains and fish and wildlife habitat areas and to avoid the degradation or loss of aquifer rechargewellhead protection areas where avoidance is not practical the intent is to minimize the environmental impacts of development within and adjacent to critical areas an overriding objective of this overlay district is to protect or enhance stream corridors and associated wetlands throughout the urban area this overlay district is also designed to ensure conservation of wetland areas and their functions where such areas are associated with steep slopes or stream corridors the overlay district promotes a balance between private property rights urban level development and public use of critical areas consistent with the maintenance of their natural appearance and functional values compliance with the washougal critical areas ordinance may reduce the need to require additional studies to ensure compliance with the

is to implement the washington shoreline management act of 1971 and the washougal shorelines management master program as endorsed by the city council on  by regulating use activities on shorelines of the city and by providing for variances as may be warranted the washington state legislature has found that the shorelines of the state are among the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources and that there is great concern throughout the state relating to their utilization protection restoration and preservation in addition it has found that ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines necessitating increased coordination in the management and development of the shorelines of the state the legislature further found that much of the shorelines of the state and the uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership  that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines of the state is not in the best public interest  and therefore coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with the shorelines of the state while at the same time recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest there is therefore a clear and urgent demand for a planned rational and concerted effort jointly performed by federal state and local governments to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines it is the policy of the state as stated in said legislation to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses this policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable water will promote and enhance the public interest this policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto the state legislature has further declared that the interest of all of the people shall be paramount in the management of shorelines of statewide significance the washington department of ecology in adopting guidelines for shorelines of statewide significance and local government in developing master programs for shorelines of statewide significance are required to and shall give preference to uses in the following order of

and citizen volunteers invested time and expertise in the question of how best to grow the northeast and northwest urban growth areas after an extensive public engagement process the community reached a consensus that it is in the public interest to promote economic opportunity and higher density housing choices in the downtown core of washougal and to encourage high quality lower density residential choices and limited commercial development opportunity in the northern urban growth areas the community consensus is reflected in these additional standards the standards contained in this chapter will apply to lands within the northeast and northwest areas at the time of annexation into the city of washougal 1guiding principles effective planning regulations are guided by principles understood and accepted by the community the guiding principles supporting this section are ageneral principles generally izoning designations should avoid creating nonconforming uses  iiassure

environmental regulations wmc title 16 bguiding principles  northwest annexation area iencourage lower density development adjacent to existing large lots  iicommercial development at the intersection of 23rd and crown road should support the new development within the northwest area and camas  and iiinew development should ensure that greenways provide connectivity to trails views parks and open space throughout the northwest area cguiding principles  northeast annexation ithe neighborhood commercial node at the intersection of 352nd and se 20th should support new development within the northeast area of the city and should be proximate to the existing fire station  iiroads and trails should follow slope contours and should connect directly to existing streets  and iiiprovide trail connections where topography makes roadway connections impractical 2zoning when the city annexes lands situated in the northern ugas it shall apply residential zoning designation to those lands in a

history ords 1167 and 1264  purposes 1convenience commercial cv athe intent of the convenience commercial district is to provide goods and services that cater to the frequent needs of residents in immediately surrounding neighborhoods this district is designed to be compatible with adjacent residential environments and provide easy accessibility to adjacent neighborhoods the successful integration of these commercial districts adjacent to neighborhoods serves to reduce vehicle miles traveled and contributes to a more viable neighborhood atmosphere bconvenience retail and service establishments are the only uses permitted in this district normally the size of the site for a convenience commercial district does not exceed five acres and typically does not contain more than five individual services or retail establishments floor area limitations are imposed to ensure such services and establishments remain small in scale and compatible with the residential environment businesses catering to highway traffic are inappropriate due to large areas of parking heavy traffic volumes and potential nuisance characteristics such as noise from loudspeakers and odors from painting uses that cater to a larger market area such as major chain grocery stores are too large in scale to be compatible with immediately adjacent neighborhoods 2community commercial district cc athe intent of this commercial district is to provide goods and services to a more regional rather than local market area bgenerally the mix of permitted uses is intended to encourage a pedestrianfriendly environment one that does not promote extensive vehicle travel for this reason highway business uses are generally not permitted and industrial and storage operations that necessitate truck traffic are only permitted as conditional uses if they can peacefully coexist in a pedestrian environment cdevelopment within this district is typically characterized by very large

in response to the federal government designation of the washougal area as a scenic gorge area and the citys comprehensive plan policies to prohibit andor limit the location of the construction of billboards in the city the prohibitions and limitations in this chapter are in keeping with the citys interest of enhancing the tourist trade to the citys scenic corridor commonly known as the gateway to the gorge these purposes are only accomplished by prohibiting billboards in most portions of the city thereby controlling protruding obstructions into ones field of view within the scenic corridor 2in recognition of the need to have billboards as a form of advertising in washougal an area has been set aside where billboards if erected pose less of an impediment to the aesthetic value of the
