to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore be it ordained by the city council of the city of terrell hills texas as follows findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of terrell hills are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately
