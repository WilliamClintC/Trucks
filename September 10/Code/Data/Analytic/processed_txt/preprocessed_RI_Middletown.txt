the town of middletown the power to enact and amend local laws relating to its property affairs and government as long as such local laws are consistent with the constitution and laws enacted by the general assembly this delegation of power includes the police power to enact reasonable legislation to regulate and supervise adultoriented establishments in order to protect the public health safety and welfare bnumerous studies based on a substantial number of cities and towns in the united states demonstrate that 1large numbers of persons primarily male frequent adultoriented establishments especially those which provide closed booths cubicles stalls or rooms for the private viewing of socalled adult motion pictures andor video tapes andor live entertainment  2such closed booths cubicles stalls and rooms are often used by patrons to engage in sexual acts  3male and female prostitutes frequent adultoriented establishments to provide sex for hire to patrons in such booths cubicles stalls and rooms  4the use of doors curtains blinds or other closures on the entrances of such booths cubicles stalls and rooms facilitates and encourages their use for sexual acts between patrons and prostitutes or other persons thereby promoting prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood semen and urine to be deposited on the floors andor walls of such enclosed areas  5patrons and other persons who enter such booths cubicles stalls and rooms may come into contact with deposits of blood semen and urine endangering their health and safety  and 6the reasonable regulation and supervision of adultoriented establishments tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution conversely a failure to impose such regulation and supervision is likely to be detrimental to the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the town cthe potential problems associated with adultoriented establishments require special supervision from the towns public safety

rhode island civil rights of persons with disabilities act ri gen laws title 42 the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada 42 usc  12101 et seq   102 findings the following findings are also made as a basis for these regulations amiddletown has been experiencing everincreasing pressures for commercial industrial and residential development these pressures are in direct confrontation with the towns concern for the general safety health and welfare of its inhabitants and the preservation of its natural resources of particular concern is the impact of future development on traffic water supply and open space in an effort to address these concerns by providing reasonable safeguards against inappropriate and potentially injurious development this chapter has established a watershed protection district and traffic sensitive districts and encourages the continued use of land for agricultural purposes and provides for conservation development for the following reasons bmiddletown is the primary watershed and major storage area for the water supply for the city of newport and the town of middletown it is essential that this resource be protected against diminution damage or despoliation accordingly this chapter in recognition of these vital concerns has established regulations and limitations with respect to the use and development of areas within the town which impact the watershed and storage areas and which are intended to protect this important resource by establishing a watershed protection district cmiddletown suffers from serious traffic problems on its major highways namely east and west main roads valley road and aquidneck avenue these problems are evidenced by mounting vehicular congestion and an increasing number of accidents these roads are now overtaxed far beyond their designed capacity and the future development of the town will only compound this situation it is essential that future access to and egress from these highly congested roads be controlled as much as possible in the interest of public safety in recognition of this problem and for the purpose of providing a measure of control this chapter has established traffic sensitive districts dmiddletown has a long history as an agricultural community with large open spaces which contribute to the beauty quality of life and ecological balance of the town it is the utilization of land for agricultural purposes which provides the most practical way of ensuring the preservation of these areas accordingly in an effort to support and encourage the use of land for agricultural purposes to the fullest extent this chapter establishes an agricultural district the fact that no district is specifically identified as an agricultural district has no significance and the use of land for agricultural purposes shall be considered a primary use in any district ein recent years patterns of both residential and commercial development have been inconsistent with historical rural development patterns rural development is characterized by large aggregated undeveloped land areas  natural features such as woodlands steep slopes floodplains wetlands stream and river corridors hedgerows and rock outcroppings scenic vistas and rural views  significant historic features such as old barns heritage trees etc  and settlement patterns characterized by clusters of compact groupings of development in otherwise wide open spaces andor appropriate topographic or vegetative screening conversely conventional suburban development converts all buildable land into house lots and streets  except for wetlands all natural areas are cleared and graded this type of development does not take into consideration individual characteristics of land including environmental cultural and historical resources conservation development on the other hand allows the same number of units as would be allowed under conventional development but also ensures a significant portion of land is preserved in its natural state  thereby fulfilling the goals of middletowns comprehensive plan   am passed 51908  103 terminology achapter shall mean of the the town of middletown rhode island

acknowledging individuals groups or events on town property the town of middletown is committed to protecting the parks recreational areas and open spaces of our community while providing opportunities for memorials that honor an individual group or event policy statement 1donors of memorials are asked to consider the primary uses of public open space in their request for a location or suitable site while appropriate memorials may enrich an experience public open space is also a very precious commodity possible memorials should be reviewed to balance these benefits 2the quality of timelessness should be considered in the significance of the individual community or event being memorialized memorial proposals should represent the community and be mindful of future generations 3memorial proposals honoring individuals or a personal event should be represented in a form that has a broader community interest 4it is recognized that a particular location may reach a saturation point and it would then be appropriate to consider limitations or a moratorium of future memorial installations at a particular location or area 5maintenance concerns should be a primary consideration with adequate provision made for continued future maintenance 6unless otherwise agreed the donors of the proposed memorial are required to pay for design manufacturing installation and maintenance endowment to ensure adequate quality of care for the memorial 7the town of middletown may consider contributing funds to a community monument only when the memorial is for a broad community purpose

serve as a guide to the town for memorials it may wish to place in parks or public areas within its jurisdiction and is subject to amendments and special exceptions as determined by the town council criteria all memorials however should be judged for appropriateness according to the following criteria these criteria are intended to serve as guidelines for the reviewing body 1the memorial represents and has been embraced and supported by the community 2the memorial has timeless qualities and makes a statement of significance to future generations 3the location under consideration is an appropriate setting for the memorial 4the location of the memorial will not interfere with existing and proposed circulation and use patterns 5the location of the memorial should be consistent with the comprehensive community plan 6the memorial contributes to the setting from a functional or design standpoint 7the memorial should be designed by a qualified professional in the field approval

site features taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural scenic and cultural resources on the site and to determine the connection of these important features to each other and strategies for protection step 2  evaluate site context the second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context of the neighborhood and town by identifying physical eg stream corridors wetlands transportation eg street and bicycle networks and cultural eg open spaces recreational opportunities connections to surrounding land uses and activities step 3  designate potential conservation areas the third step is to identify the areas on the site to be preserved on the site as open space the open space shall at a minimum include portions of the site that are unsuitable for development and which constitute the most sensitive and noteworthy natural cultural and recreational resources of the site where appropriate areas that serve to extend neighborhood open space networks tofrom surrounding property shall be identified the designation of open space shall reflect consistency with the middletown comprehensive plan step 4  determine maximum number of units at the master plan stage for major subdivisions and major land development projects and at the preliminary stage for minor subdivisions and minor land development projects the applicant and planning board shall agree
