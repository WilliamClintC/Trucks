township of lakewood where the fire hazards of materials stored therein may not be readily apparent in order to safeguard the lives of our firefighters and citizens and to promote the public safety and welfare it has become necessary to adopt a system of readily recognizable and easily understood markings these will provide our firefighters at a glance a general idea of the inherent hazards of any material and the order of severity of these hazards as they relate to fire prevention exposure and control a material identification system is necessary in order to give basic information to fire fighting personnel so as to enable them to decide whether to evacuate the area or to fight the fire and will guide them in the solution of fire fighting techniques and protective measures  1722 fire

severity of these hazards as they relate to fire prevention exposure and control its objectives are to provide an appropriate signal or alert and onthespot information to safeguard the lives of both public and private firefighter personnel during emergencies the system identifies the hazards of a material in terms of three principal categories namely  health flammability and reactivity instability and indicates the order of severity numerically by five divisions ranging from four indicating a severe hazard to zero indicating no special hazard this information is presented by a spatial system of a figure with a diamond shape with health always being to the left  flammability at the top  and reactivity instability on the right examples of spatial arrangement are shown in appendix a  of nfpa704 supplementing the spatial arrangements colored backgrounds or numbers are used for the three categories  blue for health hazard  red for flammability  and yellow for reactivity

observed in order to protect retained trees a protection from mechanical injury 18803 adopting ordinance 18803 ao999 1 prior to any grubbing or clearing all trees to be retained should be protected from equipment damage by enclosing the drip lines of the trees with sections of silt fence orange snow fence or boards wired together all exposed roots and low hanging branches should be equally protected groups of trees may be protected by fencing the drip lines of the entire tree mass to be retained 2 heavy equipment operators should not damage existing tree trunks and roots feeder roots should not be cut closer than the distance of the drip line from the tree trunks and should be cut with pruning shears or other tools which will make a clean cut 3 specimen tree trunks and exposed roots accidentally damaged during construction should be protected from further damage damaged branches should be sawed off at the branch collar no shellac or pruning paint should be used when the portion of the tree to be removed is diseased the pruning equipment should be dipped in alcohol or disinfectant prior to use on another tree to prevent the spread of the disease 4 specimen deciduous trees should be given an application of liquid slow release low nitrogen all purpose fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible damage caused by construction operations such application should be made at a distance of one foot from the trunk to the drip line and should be made as soon as construction is completed and again one year after the first application has been made 5 specimen trees should not be used for roping cables signs or fencing nails and spikes should not be driven into trees 6 tree climbing spikes shall not be used by tree care personnel on specimen trees 7 the area around the base of existing specimen trees should be left open to provide access for water and nutrients therefore no impervious cover storage of equipment materials debris or fill should be allowed within the drip line of any existing tree to be retained b protection from grade change for specimen trees 1 if an increase of the grade is proposed that negatively impacts a specimen tree the applicant should install either a a system of gravel and drain tiles at the old soil level opening into a dry well built around the trunk and 18803 lakewood code 18803 ao1000 designed for each tree individually fitting the contour of the land so that it drains water away from the tree trunk b a retaining wall between the existing grade and the higher grade a detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided c if a decrease of the grade is proposed that negatively impacts a specimen tree the applicant should initiate one of the following methods to protect the trees i terracing the grade at the drip line and out from the tree ii a retaining wall between the existing grade and the lower grade a detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided c protection from excavation 1 when digging trenches for utility lines and other similar uses the applicant should adhere to the following listed in order of preference a if possible trenches should bypass the root area b if it is impossible for the trenches to bypass the root area trenches should be tunneled under the trees where practicable c if trenches must be dug along the side of a tree the following precautions should be observed i trenches should be no closer to the trunk than half the distance from the drip line ii as few roots as possible should be cut iii if roots are cut they should be cut as cleanly as possible iv the trench should be backfilled as soon as possible avoiding soil compaction d protection during construction cleanup 1 all construction debris should be hauled away no such debris should be burned or buried 2 fences and barriers around trees should be the last thing to be removed from the site prior to the installation of additional landscaping or building

the object of parking area lighting is to provide a safe level of illumination to allow the orderly entrance and egress of vehicular traffic provide backup maneuver vision identify and illuminate entrance and exit areas and provide pedestrian and parking area illumination that will discourage vandalism theft and assault parking area lighting should not be used as an adjunct to advertising b luminaires in general the type of luminaire and pole to be used must be matched to the area zone use and size of the parking area to be lit the primary criteria should be light control  that is providing a beam spread pattern to produce an average lighting intensity as specified above without producing areas of over intensity or below intensity design  that is a low uniformity ratio the design of luminaires for parking areas should include lamp location reflector type and refractor design to deliver light to areas selected and keep light spill from adjacent areas a parking area lighting design that produces sky glow is inefficient and an irritant to residents and will not be permitted 1 sharp cutoff type luminaires are recommended as the best approach to lighting parking areas and the fixtures selected shall be of the type that can be provided with sharp cutoff deflectors or refractors the shielding angle shall be selected to minimize discomforting glare to an observers eyes from the light source at an angle below the set cutoff shielding shall also be employed to prevent spillover of undesirable light to adjoining property 2 the use of high pressure sodium or metal halide luminaires is encouraged low pressure sodium luminaires may be considered in isolated industrial areas remote from residential and commercial zones where they will not be visible from the traveled way 3 the maximum cutoff angle shall be used to shield light source glare and unwanted light from adjacent properties and motorists approaching on adjacent roads and highways as improperly designed or aimed lighting fixtures are an inherent danger to motorists and pedestrians special attention shall be given to all site lighting designs that have boundaries that include public vehicular traveled ways of any type and private traveled ways that are open to the public all applications for site plan approval that include site lighting and that have traveled ways as boundaries shall include in addition to the other requirements listed in this 1880401 lakewood code 1880402 ao1004 1880403 poles chapter the details of the point to point and beam spread calculations for all lighting that will impinge on the traveled ways as even relatively low average footcandle intensities can blind drivers who are within the focal point area of the luminaire no lighting plan will be acceptable where the central focus node of any fixture is visible from any traveled way in general no fixture shall be so aimed so that this center focus point is less than 20 degrees off of the property boundary this may require that additional and lower wattage fixtures be utilized adjacent to roadways the plan submitted shall clearly indicate the methods used to prevent roadway glare 4 where parking areas for commercial zone buildings are immediately adjacent to a residential use zone the design of the parking area lighting shall be coordinated with the design of the interzone buffer as required under other sections of this chapter the coordinated bufferlighting plan submitted shall insure that light spill from the parking lot shall not impinge on the residential area in excess of 02 footcandle a the type and height of all poles for mounting luminaires shall be consistent with the general design of the application b utility type wood poles may be used only on parking areas of one acre or less except where parking lot illumination is provided by the electric utility all wood poles shall be pressure treated to resist rot and termite damage and the pole class shall result in a wind load rating as specified in the boca architectural wood poles shall be rated for the applicable wind load and shall have adequate wiring access as required by the national electric

height as follows 1 for sites up to five acres 25 feet 2 for sites greater than five acres 30 feet 3 for sites designated as shopping malls poles of greater height may be approved by the board on the submission of lighting design by a professional engineer indicating that a greater height is required and that the greater height will not produce light spill to adjacent areas above the limits hereinbefore listed 1880402 adopting ordinance 1880403 ao1005 1880404 commercial building and outdoor sales site lighting 4 all mounting poles shall meet wind loading requirements as specified in all applicable building codes a the object of exterior lighting of a commercial building is to provide a safe level of illumination to allow the orderly entrance and egress of pedestrian traffic identify and illuminate entrance and exit doors and loading areas and to provide illumination levels that will discourage vandalism theft and assault while it is recognized that commercial building lighting is also used to attract and advertise the building occupants trade this type of lighting shall be designed so that the resulting illumination levels are not detrimental to adjacent property owners and occupants b luminaires in general the type of luminaire and mounting method to be used must be matched to the area construction type use and size of the building to be lit the primary criteria should be light control  that is providing a beam spread pattern that will produce an average lighting intensity desired without producing areas of either over intensity or below intensity design c conflicts as to color temperature and lamp type with lighting of adjacent properties shall be avoided for example if one or more adjacent areas with established lighting systems are using mercury vapor lamps the submitted area shall conform to the same lamp type but not necessarily the same type luminaire the hid high intensity discharge type of lamp may be considered when compelling reasons exist for employing such lamps and ample proof that a suitable method can be employed to reduce color conflict d security lighting all parking area walkways and appurtenant passageways and driveways may be illuminated for safety and security reasons between sunset to sunrise e to insure that the proposed lighting plan conforms to the scope and limitations of this chapter the following data and information shall be submitted with every application for site plan approval 1 type of luminaires 2 type and wattage of lamp 3 mounting height of luminaire 4 photometric data and isolux lines of the luminaire and lamp proposed photometric curves shall be drawn to the same scale as the site plan scale and shall show initial and maintained footcandle levels of illumination f where building lighting is proposed to be provided via pole mounted fixtures the type and height of pole must also be submitted applicants 1880403 lakewood code 1880404 ao1006 1880405 sign illumination requirements for signs are provided in  18812 of the chapter however all signs including sections of building surfaces of any kind that are externally or internally illuminated shall conform in addition to all requirements of  18812 to the following requirements 1880406 lighting and illumination in residential districts are encouraged to use architectural wooden or duranodic bronze colored aluminum poles in keeping with the architecture of the building and surrounding areas the use of bollard downlight fixtures is encouraged for exterior walkways as the spherical globe type of luminaire has a low coefficient of utilization are therefore inherently energy inefficient and contribute to excessive sky glow their use is to be discouraged g commercial recreational facilities such as driving ranges stadiums outdoor arenas etc shall be illuminated as required by the site use however all of the perimeter area lighting light spillage and protection from glare on traveled roadways shall conform to the requirements of  1880401 and 1880402 h outdoor sales facilities such as new and used automobile lots shall be illuminated as required by the site use however all of the perimeter area lighting light spillage and protection from glare on traveled roadways shall conform to the requirements of  1880401 and 1880402 a no illuminated sign that is visible from a traveled roadway or traveled way used by motor vehicles shall have a degree of luminance that causes visual discomfort to drivers the degree of luminance allowable is a factor of luminance ratio sign luminance to surrounding luminance and illumination color in general no sign shall have a surface luminance greater than 750 footlamberts or greater than a five to one ratio between sign luminance and average surrounding luminance b outdoor large scale advertising signs shall use an illumination source that is not visible to either motorists or pedestrians when on normal traveled roads streets or walkways c no sign shall use a repetitive onoff design d no sign shall incorporate strobe lamps e no sign shall use animation by either mechanical electrical or electronic means f all interior signs that are within six feet of glass show windows shall conform to subsections 1880405c d and e above 1880404 adopting ordinance 1880406 ao1007 a the intent of this section is to promote a safe healthy and attractive place to live in the township of lakewood all exterior lighting in residential areas should be designed and installed with the rights and interests of adjacent property owners in mind b residential street lighting shall conform to  18804 of this chapter the primary goal of street lighting in residential districts is vehicular traffic control and pedestrian safety and as a general deterrent to crime in overhead utility districts street lighting from wood utility poles is acceptable in residential districts all street lighting wiring shall be underground c exterior lighting at parks recreational facilities ball fields and municipal parking lots shall conform to the requirements of subsections 1880405b and c above d lighting of residential plots to the extent required for discouragement of theft
