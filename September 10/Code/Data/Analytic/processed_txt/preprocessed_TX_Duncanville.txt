authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the texas water section  et seq delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses exh a 3707 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage exh a 3707 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure the potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area exh a 3707 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands exh a 3707 secs 9a59a10  reserved article ii  definitions words terms defined unless specifically defined below words or phrases

discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection a above to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits if the industrial user already has a discharge permit the director may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits an industrial user shall submit to the director an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes c if the director chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection b above the director shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended an industrial user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits d the more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the
