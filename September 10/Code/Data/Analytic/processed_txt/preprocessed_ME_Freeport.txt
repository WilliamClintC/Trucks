encourage creative development that preserves the gullies and streams an undisturbed buffer along interstate 295 and existing trails and provides links for a better connected trail system trails should serve a recreational use or to connect key locations and can provide an alternative form of transportation that will help mitigate the traffic congestion created by increased housing densities and tourist traffic improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists create opportunities for residents to increase physical activity and improve health promote economic vitality and to build a stronger sense of community by allowing people of all ages to walk and bike on common rights of way these provisions are intended further to create good neighborhood development and to minimize the cost of constructing and maintaining utilities and streets all residential subdivisions in the village area are required to provide open space secondary conservation areas are shown on the village open space map dated  included as addendum 2 to this in some cases the open space would be too small or in a location that is not considered to be secondary conservation area in those cases the project review board may require that a fee in lieu of open space land be paid for developments that have secondary conservation area but not enough to meet the village open space requirement the project review board may require that a combination of dedicated open space and a fee in lieu of open space 504b2 applicability 1 this section 504b shall apply to a all applications for approval of subdivisions within the freeport village overlay district submitted after  whether or not any such application would be deemed a pending proceeding under 1 mrsa 302 and b any application to amend a

approve village open space subdivisions which conform to the requirements of this the subdivision the town of freeport and all other applicable ordinances of the town of freeport the project review board shall be further authorized to require public access on some or all of the required open space 504b4 open space requirements 1 meeting the requirement the open space requirement in village open space subdivisions shall be met with land only if the parcel has secondary conservation areas as shown on the village open space map 1  125  dated  or would provide a connection or link for a trail to or between a destination shown on open space map 2 dated   the project review board may require public access in the open space where such access would further the purposes described in above and where because of the location of the required open space prohibiting public access would frustrate the purposes described in  fee in lieu of land a if the parcel does not include any secondary conservation area the applicant will pay a fee in lieu of open space the fee shall be established by order of the town council and may be amended from time to time by order of the town council the fee shall be uniform throughout the freeport village overlay district and shall be based on fair market value of back land or conservation land in freeport the fee shall be established on a square foot basis for example if an acre of nondevelopable land is valued at $30000 then the open space fee would be calculated as follows $30000 acre 43560 square feetunit per acre   70 per square foot of open space b the project review board may approve a combination of open space land and a fee in lieu of open space when a parcel has significant open space but not enough to meet the required open space area for example if a subdivision is required to provide 15000 sf of open space and the board decides that the parcel has 5000 sf of secondary conservation area the 10000 sf of remaining required open space may be paid as a fee in lieu of open space if the fee per square foot is 70 the fee shall be 70 x 10000 or $7000 in addition to the open space land c the fees shall be deposited in the land bank fund as described in of the municipal the fees shall be used at the discretion of the town council to purchase open space or to provide village open space amenities such as trail construction parks

water supply and sewage disposal systems for subdivision lots provided the appropriate easements are in place 7 easements for drainage 504b6 ownership options for open space open space shall meet the ownership options outlined in c rural flexible lot development {amended effective } a purpose the purpose of this section is to provide landowners in rural districts an alternative approach to lot development this section allows for the same lot density as traditional lot development while providing for the creation of open space and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands vernal pools and steep slopes it allows flexibility in the size and shape of lot development this section applies only where the development of the lots does not constitute a subdivision as defined in 30a mrsa section 4401 b applicability rural flexible lot developments may be created in the rural residential 1 1a and 2 districts and the resource protection 2 district on a parcel that is greater than 75 acres a flexible lot shall mean a new designated piece of land created under the space standards of c the open space lot shall mean the remaining land of the lot of record at the time of the survey submission that has at least 25 acres with 200 feet of road frontage plus the required open space and any remaining land of the lot of record flexible a rural flexible lot development are limited to the permitted use of a single family dwelling c flexible lot space standards minimum lot size 20000 square feet maximum lot size 1 acre minimum road frontage requirement 100 feet maximum building height 35 feet minimum setback front 50 feet side 25 feet rear 50 feet minimum setback from the perimeter of the lot of record 50 feet minimum shore frontage 150 feet minimum lot width 100 feet d flexible lot limitation and calculating density regardless of the size of a parcel no rural flexible lot development shall have more than 4 flexible defined by b above to calculate the number of flexible   divide the total acreage by 25 acres for any lot that would have 200 of road frontage available for wouldnt have 200 of road frontage available on an existing public or private road divide the acreage by 275 acres land area used for a rightofway that is created to meet road frontage requirement for the flexible lot may not be included in the land area of the flexible lot any houses that exist on the property must use one of the allowable lots example a 10 acre lot with 400 of road frontage would yield 3 lots  two flexible one open space lot two of the lots have 200 feet of road frontage and would have a minimum lot size of 25 acres or a total of 5 acres because there isnt 200 of road frontage for the third lot the remaining 5 acres uses a minimum lot size of 275 acres  therefore only one more flexible lot is allowed e calculating open space and lot size the required open space is the difference between the minimum lot size of 25 acres and the size of the flexible lot created regardless of the minimum lot size used for calculating the density the open space lot is the sum of all of the required open space areas plus the required rural lot size of 25 acres with at least 200 feet of road frontage plus any remaining land of the lot of record except as allowed below in cf environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands vernal pools and steep slopes should not be included in a flexible lot to the extent possible the open space lot must include a deed restriction explaining the land area of the required open space and that it may not be further subdivided or developed in perpetuity for example using the same example as above  the 2 flexible  and 30000 square feet each 25 acres   108900 square feet flexible lot 1  20000 square feet open space

acres remaining land of lot of record + 39 acres required open space   89 acres f use of open space lot the open space lot may have one single family dwelling with any of the following accessory uses agriculture agritourism activity and timber harvesting and forest management noncommercial recreation that doesnt require permanent structures water and sewage disposal systems for the open space lot and flexible lots in the development provided the appropriate easements are provided utility andor drainage easements the area of the open space may be transferred to a government entity or a nonprofit organization that has a mission of holding land for conservation purposes if the open space is transferred it must have a deed restriction that protects the land from future development in perpetuity the remaining land must have at least 25 acres and 200 feet of road frontage  128  g application submission requirements all rural flexible lot developments require the review and approval of the town planner and the codes enforcement officer an application for review and approval must include the following information 1 two plot plans based on the deed for the property prepared by a licensed surveyor including a the approximate location of all of the proposed lots including dimensions and lot sizes b the approximate location of any easements on the property c a calculation that

of removing accumulated waste matter from boats which have selfcontained sanitary waste disposal units extraction a purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate both new and existing excavations and their accessory uses excavations are unique uses because they must be located where the desired natural resources exist and because they generally must expand if the use is to continue existing and proposed excavations therefore are and may be adjacent to or within residential districts and may have adverse impacts on surrounding uses due to their potential for producing noise dust vibration traffic and groundwater contamination these regulations are intended to protect the quality and quantity of ground and surface waters prevent erosion and sedimentation provide for the reclamation and rehabilitation of new and existing excavations minimize any adverse impact of such excavations on adjacent and nearby properties and insure minimum standards of safety during and after active operations it is the intent of this permit existing excavations to continue to operate and to expand it is also the intent of this section to require rehabilitation of expanded and newly excavated areas excavations existing as of  may continue to exist and expand without rezoning only if they meet the requirements of this excavations except for short term excavations require the creation by the town council of a mining and extraction overlay district before the use is permitted  new excavations are subject to the requirements of this expansions defined under existing excavations require less extensive review by the project review board larger expansions of existing excavations short term excavations and new excavations require more extensive review because of their potential for creating a greater impact on surrounding properties and the environment and the review is undertaken by the project review board as an extension of the site plan review process b definitions 1 abandoned

physical setting representing a period important in the evolution of the town it is understood in this case that the physical setting which is composed of buildings landscape features and open space and other natural and architectural features can transcend the sum of its parts in creating a sense of history some examples of situations in which a building would have neighborhood significance are it is one of a group of similar buildings constructed andor designed by an individual important in freeport history  it is a compatible element in a group of buildings of similar or equally important significant architectural styles  its location ie on a corner lot on a rise of land or a curve on a large parcel of land as the first building to visually introduce an important group of buildings makes it an important element in the neighborhood  its size gives it a dominant place in the neighborhood reconstruction the rebuilding or constructing again of a building or part of a building the reconstruction may or may not be a return to the original design of the building rehabilitation the upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition for human habitation or use rehabilitation does not necessarily retain the buildings original architectural features restoration the replication or reconstruction of a buildings original architectural features restoration

buildings within the districts newly constructed or reconstructed buildings as well as existing buildings and their appurtenances which have been altered repaired or moved shall be visually compatible with the buildings squares and places to which they are visually related and specifically with nearby andor adjacent a or b buildings in terms of the following factors 1 scale of the building the scale of a building depends on its overall size the mass of it in relationship to the open space around it and the sizes of its doors windows porches and balconies the scale gives a building presence  that is it makes it seem big or small awkward or graceful overpowering or unimportant the scale of a building should be visually compatible with its site and with its neighborhood 2 height a sudden dramatic change in building height can have a jarring effect on the streetscape ie the way the whole street looks a tall building can shade its neighbors andor the street the height or buildings should be visually compatible with the heights of the buildings in the neighborhood 3 proportion of buildings front facade the first impression a building gives is that of its front facade the side of the building which faces the most frequently used 8 public way the relationship of the width to the height of the front facade should be visually compatible with that of its neighbors 4 rhythm of solids to voids in front facades when you look at any facade of a building you see openings such as doors or windows voids in the wall surface solid usually the voids appear as dark areas almost holes in the solid and they are quite noticeable setting up a pattern or rhythm the pattern of solids and voids in the front facade of a new or altered building should be visually compatible with that of its neighbors 5 proportions of opening within the facility windows and doors come in a variety of shapes and sizes  even rectangular window and door openings can appear quite different depending on their dimensions the relationship of the height of windows and doors to their width should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with that of its neighbors 6 roof shapes a roof can have a dramatic impact on the appearance of a building the shape and proportion of the roof should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with those of neighboring buildings 7 relationship of facade materials the facades of a building are what give it character and the character varies depending on the materials of which the facades are made and their texture in freeport many different materials and colors are used on facades  clapboards shingles patterned shingles brick  depending on the architectural style of the building the facades of a building particularly the front facade should be visually compatible with those of other buildings around it in the color overlay district colors shall be compatible with historic buildings and the colors should not dominate the architectural features of the building and other buildings around it 8 rhythm of spaces to building on streets the building itself is not the only thing you see when you look at it  you are also aware of the space where the building is not ie the open space which is around the building looking along a street the buildings and open spaces set up a rhythm the rhythm of spaces to buildings should be considered when determining visual compatibility whether it is between buildings or between buildings and the street setback 9 site features the size placement and materials of walks walls fences signs driveways and parking areas may have a visual impact on a building these features should be visually compatible with the building and neighboring buildings 10 in

a 5 b3b chapter 33 styrofoam ordinance whereas the council finds that 1 located in maine on the shore of the north atlantic ocean an area known worldwide for its natural beauty fish and other wildlife the town of freeport believes that it has an obligation to maintain and preserve its special natural environment  2 maintenance of freeport as litterfree as possible is important to protect and preserve its natural environment and enhance its quality of life for residents and visitors  3 the united nations environmental programme diplomatic conference in montreal montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer acknowledged the threat of chlorofluorocarbons to the earths atmosphere and established international goals for the phased reduction of the manufacture and use of specific chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs the town of freeport supports international and federal efforts to reduce the nonessential use of chlorofluorocarbons  4 the federal environmental protection agency reports that foam products account for 28% of ozonedepleting potential of cfcs blowing agents used in the production of noncfc psfs create hazardous earthlevel smog  5 the federal environmental protection agency has issued a national municipal waste strategy calling for a 25 percent reduction in solid waste by 1992 the strategy titled the solid waste dilemma an agenda for action includes the promotion of recycling the state of maine is considering how to implement this strategy  6 the state of maine has banned the service of food and beverages in polystyrene foam containers at facilities or functions of the state or its political subdivisions effective  38 mrsa et seq  7 readily disposable consumer plastic containers and wrappers including those made from polystyrene foam are essentially not biodegradable and as litter do not decompose over time into the natural environment  8 the use of readily disposable consumer plastic containers and wrappers has increased annually and projections indicate a significant growth in their use  9 plastic litter particularly polystyrene foam poses a threat to the natural environment including fish and other wildlife  1 10 this serve the public interest by reducing the amount of nonbiodegradable waste littering freeport as a portion of any substitute packaging is expected to be composed of biodegradable material in whole or in part polystyrene foam litter is highly durable buoyant and nonbiodegradable and therefore persists and detracts from the appearance of the area longer than many other types of litter  11 at the present time there is no recycling program in freeport for polystyrene foam food or beverage containers  12 some other commonly used food packaging materials are also nonbiodegradable and contribute to litter problems  nevertheless the council finds that it is appropriate to regulate polystyrene foam food packaging while not regulating other types of food packaging at this time for the following reasons a to minimize disruption in the food services and sales industry the council should avoid banning a wide range of packaging materials at one time it might be appropriate to ban other packaging materials in the future but an incremental approach to eliminating undesirable packaging materials will cause less disruption and allow the town to handle enforcement in more manageable stages  b polystyrene foam is the most commonly used nonreuseable food packaging material for prepared foods in restaurants and food service establishments in freeport and therefore prohibiting its use for such purpose and its sale at retail will be the most effective way of reducing nonbiodegradable litter in freeport  c ingestion of polystyrene foam particles has been identified as a hazard to wildlife while this problem has not been associated with other food packaging materials now therefore be it ordered 1 on and after  no retail food vendor shall serve or sell prepared food and no food packager shall package meat eggs bakery products or other food in polystyrene foam psf containers  2 on and after  no vendor in the town of freeport who sells tangible personal property at retail shall sell polystyrene foam food or beverage containers  3 violations of this be punishable by fines as follows a a fine not exceeding $250 for the first violation in a oneyear period  b a fine not exceeding $500 for the second and each subsequent violation in a oneyear period  2 4 provided nevertheless that the effective date of this be postponed if and as long as there is developed and maintained an effective townwide recycling program for polystyrene foam food and beverage containers as determined by the town council  5 definitions as used in this following
