number shall be assigned c for most roads there is a logical start point at which addressing should begin at zero generally at the end of the road which connects a larger traffic artery road numbering should generally begin at the point where emergency responders are most likely to enter the road so numbers will be ascending as responders search for a location where there is no obvious end with greater traffic flow it is recommended that the start point be selected at the end that is closer to the town center or at the end which is otherwise the logical zero point for addressing if there is no way to select a start point one may default to numbering east to west or south to north or one can be selected by best judgment d all numbers shall be properly affixed on or near the front entrance or in some other manner visible from the street the numbers must be easily legible figures not less than two 2 inches high and in a color contrasting to the building background reflective numbers are recommended the united states post office requires correct easily legible numbers which are not obscured by anything the homeowner is responsible for the numbers on the house or unit if the house is

district shall also be subject to the following standards 1 siting a relation to topography generally buildings shall be placed so as to minimize breaking the skyline when observed from arterial and collector roadways buildings shall be designed to be part of not an extension of the hillside specifically in achieving this objective the development review board shall apply the following standards in the specified portions of the gd4 district 1 west of i89 south of us2 and east of niquette bay road as viewed from i89 or us2 looking westerly or southwesterly buildings shall be located with a complete backdrop of existing trees to the sides of and above the building 2 east of us27 the existing wooded slope on the east side of the ravine parallel to us27 shall remain undisturbed except for a single roadway access across the ravine buildings located east of the ravine shall be sited so that the existing tree line along the ravine is above the tallest point of the building as viewed from us27 the development review board may permit a minor portion 20% or less of a building to be visible from a few intermittent segments of us 27 if it determines that all steps have been taken to minimize building visibility including considering alternative siting 3 relation to other buildings buildings shall be located so as to promote interconnected activity between neighboring buildings an applicant shall depict pedestrian walkways between buildings 2 building details a height  increases in height limits for buildings developed as part of a planned unit development may be permitted where the following standards are met 1 the building is hidden from the view of persons utilizing arterial and collector roads by other buildings trees or natural barriers andor 2 the building is sited in a location where the existing grade lies below the pavement level of arterial and collector roads 3 the site is designed with the use of architectural features color and landscaping that are in character with the surrounding rural scenery and natural landscape in considering a request for increased building height the board shall give special consideration where the applicant locates the buildings so that they are 1 framed or backed by a hillside  or 2 on an elevation below the elevation of adjacent and nearby major roadways b shape and massing the vertical mass of buildings shall be in character with other adjacent structures as well as with the topography of the site bulky rectangularform buildings with little variation in shape or design shall be avoided the development review board may waive massing details for industrial buildings if the screening andor siting removes any adverse visual impact from such buildings as viewed from adjacent roadways and properties variation may be accomplished by one or more of the following means 1 physical offsets in which a building steps forward or back along its faade 2 transitions in building height with steps up and down to achieve a sense of balance abrupt changes in building height that disturb this sense of balance are not permitted 3 in lieu of physical offsets the use of banding changes in materials trim and cornices 4 for retail buildings physical offsets or design details shall be required at regular intervals of approximately 50 or less along each faade of a building having a public entrance or visible from an arterial or  c facades 1 the visible portion of buildings from arterial and collector roads shall be given special detailing and architectural consideration other facades shall also reflect the reasonable use of appropriate building materials and colors so as to avoid a high degree of architectural contrast or the appearance of being unfinished 2 facades shall build upward from the ground with defined bases middles and tops the use of cornices and trim provides visual separation between layers and helps both to terminate the structure vertically as well as bridge several connected buildings together 3 on buildings constructed in connection with all industrial uses the development review board shall require only those building facades that are visible from arterial and collector roads to be finished to the standards of subsections 1 and 2 herein d fenestration 1 the arrangements of openings along a facade are an important element for consideration too many openings create visual clutter while too few openings create large blank and uninteresting faces the use of arches and lintels to define openings helps create a strong street edge and helps provide visual interest 2 applicants are strongly encouraged to provide ample windows and other openings along all facades of a structure that are open to pedestrian access or by which pedestrians may travel walls without windows are prohibited except where the development review board finds such is justified by a public safety concern at a minimum windows and other openings shall be provided at the pedestrian level 3 entry doors shall be clearly defined with an increased level of detail for example the use of entrances with awning and steps entrances helps to define pedestrian spaces and attract visitors storefront windows shall be raised above the sidewalk to display merchandise at eye level while acting as a visual wainscoting to the pedestrian space 4 the development review board may waive fenestration details for industrial buildings if the proposed screening andor location of the building otherwise fully mitigates any adverse visual impact from such buildings as viewed from adjacent roadways and properties e materials whenever possible the use of native and natural materials wood stone and brick is encouraged in design glaring or reflective materials vertical or metal siding exterior insulation finishing systems t111 stucco or other synthetic building products shall not be used except 1 in areas not visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic  or 2 at positions above the

3 as a matter of public policy the town of colchester finds that the coordination of offstreet parking areas between adjoining nonresidential sites is desirable to allow for traffic circulation between sites rather than having all traffic entering and exiting the existing road system to proceed from site to site this coordination can take various forms from a simple paved connection to a more elaborate plan to provide both a connection and shared parking arrangements such connection and shared parking are not to be considered a parking waiver but an agreement between the landowners and the town of colchester to effect an overall circulation and parking plan and provide the required number of parking spaces in accordance with the applicable provisions of for the respective uses

requirements of this section and e the required number of parking spaces is to be provided and spaces that are paved must be striped and must be shown on an approved plan the number of required parking spaces may be reduced provided that a reserved parking plan is approved as per f in no event shall parking and loading spaces for a nonresidential use be located in any residential district f shared parking on a single lot where the development review board determines that a proposed development consisting of two or more uses located on a single parcel will generate different hourly daily andor seasonal parking demand due to the varied hours of operation of each use and frequencies of customer and employee occupancy of available parking spaces the development review board may approve a site plan utilizing shared parking the applicant shall provide the parking space count and justification analysis approved shared parking requires the present construction of a lesser number of spaces

general fund is not dedicated to a specific purpose therefore it is important to describe the purpose of any balance therein this policy establishes goals and provides guidance concerning the desired level of fund balance maintained by the town maintenance of a fund balance will mitigate financial risk that can occur from unforeseen revenue fluctuations in tax collections and unanticipated expenditures due to disasters or unexpected and unusual public safety expenses it will reduce the cost of borrowing and can provide tax rate stabilization ii purpose in private business or personal finance it is ideal to have enough money available for unexpected expenses  for times of decreased revenue  or to pay bills as they come in for example a homeowner may need to buy a new roof or replace a septic system or be out of work due to illness or injury for an extended period of time saving for such contingencies is preferable to going into debt savings are achieved in personal finance by earning more than you spend in business earning more than you spend on an accounting basis results in net income net income can be distributed to owners or kept by the business as retained earnings retained earnings may be reinvested in the business kept for future reinvestment or be used to cover unplanned expenses or a lack of revenue like a private business the town is an ongoing enterprise the towns annual general fund operating budget may result in a surplus annual revenues exceed expenses or deficit annual expenses exceed revenues in any given year the sum of the operating surpluses and deficits for all years is called the general fund fund balance maintenance of a fund balance is essential to the preservation of the financial integrity of the town and is fiscally advantageous for both the town and the taxpayers as with individual or business finance  in a given year the town may experience a lack of revenue or expenses beyond those planned insufficient revenue can stem from lack of collections in a specific year or over time during extended financial duress the average tax collection vs budgeted tax collections from fy11 to fy15 was 99% $80446 less than budgeted but in fy 11 we only collected 958% $362923 less than budgeted tax payments could be more significantly affected by a rise in unemployment additionally given that the local option sales tax is considered less stable than the property tax consideration should be given to 1 not budgeting the expense of the entire local option tax revenue estimate andor 2 maintaining a fund balance in part due to the potential for lack of sales tax revenues expenses might exceed budget due to a disaster or weather event requiring significant public works expenditures or a significant ongoing police investigation although the town is often eligible for federal and state disaster aid there is often a matching amount required it can take years to even determine whether expenditures under a declared disaster are eligible for aid the fund balance could be used to provide the required match of 75% to 25% to federal aid and to pay for numerous costs that are not reimbursable even under a declared federal disaster the town does not budget for these exceptional situations just as with individual or private business finance we have a tool the fund balance to provide funding necessary to address unexpected decreases in revenue or unbudgeted expenses cash flow or working capital is important it helps avoid borrowing to pay bills that come due before revenue comes in colchesters first property tax installment of the fiscal year is due august 15 therefore the town has oneandahalf months of expenses to cover before the first tax bill is due reducing cost of borrowing is a way to save money over time bonds for debt issued on behalf of the town of colchester are generally rated aa2 by moodys this is the eighth of ten investment grade rankings for bonds which are designated from aaa highest to baa3 lowest the interest rate difference from an aa2 bond top 8 of 10 investment grades to a baa1 bond bottom 3 of 10 investment grades is about 07% these investment grades do not include speculate grades ba1 otherwise known as junk bonds the town has $52 million in outstanding debt to be paid off in 12 years on this amount and length of loan the difference in borrowing costs between aa2 and baa3 is about 28% or approximately $250000 having a healthy fund balance is one of the many measures taken when going to market for bonds stabilization of tax rate is another use for a fund balance especially when the tax rate like ours is based on growth in value of property development in the last five years ending in fy15 to avoid incorporating the local option tax net municipal liability operating and capital expenses funded by property taxes has grown by 21% annually yet the property tax rate per hundred dollars of property valuation has decreased by 23% over this five year period this was due to increased property value and investment of 43% annually over this same period should the rate of growth decrease which is possible because we have a limited supply of developable land and service needs increase in cost it would be advantageous to be able to mute the effect of the increase in any given year by applying a portion of the fund balance to the operating budget this would moderate the impact of a tax increase in any given year iii definitions fund balance is a measurement of available financial resources and is the difference between total assets and total liabilities gasb statement 54 distinguishes fund balance classified based on the relative strength of the constraints that control the purposes for which specified amounts can be spent beginning with the most restrictive constraints fund balance amounts will be reported in the following categories 1 nonspendable fund balance  amounts that are not in a spendable form eg inventory such as gasoline in tanks or prepaid expenses such as insurance 2 restricted fund balance  amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by parties external to the town of colchester eg grants or donations 3 committed fund balance  amounts that can be used only for a specific purpose determined by a vote of the voters including votes on budgets that include commitment of a fund balance commitments can be uncommitted by vote or by expiration of the authorization eg the budget year has concluded 4 assigned fund balance  amounts intended to be used by the government for specific purposes intent can be expressed by the selectboard 5 unassigned fund balance  includes all amounts not contained in other classifications and is the residual classification of the general fund only unassigned amounts are available for any legal purpose iv policy annual review of fund balance the fund balance shall be reviewed annually by the selectboard after receipt and presentation of the audit by the auditor due to the timing of this review changes to the fund balance as it relates to minimum and maximum unassigned fund balance shall be addressed in the next capital planning or general fund budget process that begins after this review minimum unassigned fund balance it is the goal of the town to achieve and maintain an unassigned fund balance in the general fund at fiscal yearend that is not less than 13% of the prior years operating expenditures which shall include for this purpose the operating budget and bond payments this formula does not include a funding of voter approved capital plans since they are internal commitments that can be revisited in times of significant economic duress or b legislatively required payments to the school district regardless of whether or not taxes are actually collected if the unassigned fund balance at fiscal yearend falls below the goal the town shall develop a restoration plan to achieve and maintain the minimum fund balance maximum unassigned fund balance it is the goal of the town to achieve and maintain an unassigned fund balance in the general fund at fiscal yearend that does not exceed 17% of the prior years operating expenditures which shall include for this purpose the operating budget and bond payments this formula does not include a funding of voter approved capital plans since they are internal commitments that can be revisited in times of significant economic duress or b legislatively required payments to the school district regardless of whether or not taxes are actually collected if the unassigned fund balance at fiscal yearend exceeds this goal the town shall develop a plan to achieve and maintain the minimum fund balance the plan should take into consideration the operating and capital needs of the town the plan shall consider carefully the use of the fund balance so as not to cause tax spikes for example if a the budgeted general fund increase was $300000 3% over the prior year and there was no increase in grand list value and b $300000 of the fund balance was used to eliminate the tax increase altogether then the following year 1 there is again no grand list growth and another similar budget increase and 2 no fund balance is applied to the budget then the resulting tax increase would be 6% it would be more advantageous and palatable to taxpayers to apply the $300000 over the course of several years to avoid a spike when the fund balance is not used the town could reduce the fund balance by spending it on capital projects this would be done by both a having a project approved selectboard held public hearing process which authorizes capital projects and b funding the projects transfer from the general fund to a capital project fund voter approval of the
