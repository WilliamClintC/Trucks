improvements to system capital facilities to accommodate new development d study conducted in order to implement an equitable wastewater impact fee system the city has caused to be prepared a wastewater impact fee study hereinafter termed study said study is incorporated herein by reference and sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of development on the citys system capital facilities and for determining the cost of acquiring the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such services created by new development e standards established the city hereby establishes as city standards the assumptions and level of service los standards referenced in the study as part of its current plans for future expansions to the citys system capital facilities f impact fee use limited the impact fees described in this ordinance are based on the study and do not exceed the costs of improvements to serve new development that will pay the impact fees nor shall such fees be used to correct existing deficiencies for these capital facilities or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements g benefit all of the capital wastewater facilities listed in the study will benefit all new development that depends on city services and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire system as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the impact fees supplement no 34 title 9   9323 hot springs code 9325 wastewater system h impact fee relationship there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this ordinance and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay i impact fee purposes this ordinance creates a system by which wastewater impact fees paid by new development will be used to finance defray or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for systems capital wastewater facilities in ways that benefit the development that paid each fee within a reasonable period of time after the fee is paid 9324 intent a capital improvement plan this ordinance is adopted to assist in the implementation of the citys capital improvement plan cip for wastewater system projects to that end the intent of this ordinance is to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to capital wastewater facilities  to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of improvements for capital wastewater facilities required to accommodate new development  and to ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for improvements for capital wastewater facilities that benefit such new development b impact fee purpose it is the further intent of this ordinance that new development pay for its fair share of the cost of improvements for capital wastewater facilities required to accommodate new development imposition of an impact fee that will be used to finance defray or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements to the city capital wastewater facilities that serve or benefit such new development it is not the intent of this ordinance to collect any money from any new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for capital wastewater facilities c funds restricted it is not the intent of this ordinance that any monies collected from any impact fee deposited in the wastewater impact fee trust fund ever be commingled with monies from any other city trust fund or account or ever be used for a type of facility or equipment different from that for which the fees are paid or are ever used to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements 9325 impact fee imposed a impact fee obligation after the effective date of this ordinance any person firm or corporation who commences any development except those exempted hereinafter shall be obligated to pay impact fees upon commencement of such activity the amount of the fees shall be determined in accordance with this

in connection with and as a condition to the installation of a water meter serving the development should there not be water service to the development the impact fee will be collected at the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for those developments located outside the corporate limits of hot springs that are not served by water the certificate of occupancy shall be limited to the developments wastewater system c impact fee calculation impact fees shall be based on water meter size where no water meter is present the utilities director shall determine and assign a water meter size

numbering guide the following street naming and property numbering guide is hereby adopted a introduction on  the citizens of hot springs and garland county approved the 911 emergency services program proper implementation of this program requires the use of a standardized and consistent street naming and numbering system the principles and procedures enumerated hereinafter were developed to accomplish this purpose in addition to the needs of our emergency services personnel the street location and identification concerns of our citizens visitors and tourists and the us postal service were evaluated the system was developed without regard to jurisdictional boundaries as such boundaries can change years the system is continuous along major thoroughfares to the county lines supplement no 23 title 12   1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks implementation of these principles will require the renaming and renumbering of some existing streets in establishing these initial principles substantial effort was made to honor local history and tradition by not creating circumstances requiring the changing of well known or historical street names preservation of all names however is not possible due to the existence of duplication poor name selection and misapplication of names eg main street in south hot springs these rules have general applicability and shall be used when reviewing proposed new street names as well as required renaming it is also anticipated that occurrences will arise when strict application of these principles would be detrimental to the general public for whom they are designed to assist and protect in such cases common sense and public necessity should prevail this document is the combined work of the hot springs board of directors city staff the garland county emergency services coordinator fire service volunteers us postal service ambulance service and the 911 consulting engineer it is based in part on a similar work published by the metropolitan area planning commission in pulaski county b general principles of street naming several street naming principles should be followed in the hot springs area affected communities and planned developments principle no 1 standard elements establish a standard street or road name which shall consist of the following three parts  directional prefix principle name simple or compound and a suffix thoroughfare designation through streets should use suffix identifiers denoting traffic classes principle no 2 avoid duplication there should be no duplication of street names or numbers used as principle names among an incorporated area incorporated areas in garland county are hot springs mountain pine and lonsdale hot springs village and diamondhead are planned developments that should follow these same guidelines the remaining portions of the county will be treated as one incorporated area and should have no duplication of names if for example hot springs and hot springs village both have a cherokee drive one must be changed  however if hot springs and mountain pine both have a ouachita avenue then both can remain since they are in separate incorporated areas note due to the predominance or exclusive use of spanish names in the hot springs village development the use of similarly derived names in the balance of the county and in the city is discouraged and duplication shall not be permitted title 12   supplement no 23 1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks an exception to the duplication rule will allow a branching street or culdesac to have the same name as the street from which it originates in this case a suffix would be used to differentiate between the street of origin and a branching street branch suffix designations such as place circle loop court or trail may be used in the same manner but only where near waterfront properties principle no 3 avoid confusion street names that sound very similar or offer only a variation in spelling should be avoided ie cherry and cheery lynwood and linwood compound principle names shall not be duplicated even if written as one word versus two words eg pinewood vs pine wood or mary lou vs marylou principle no 4 establish continuity a street running in one direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length however if a street jogs sharply 90 degrees or more for a distance of more than 315 feet successive portions of the street should be given a different name however there are many streets that run for long distances andor change direction radically which have had their name for many years in such cases renaming all sections that change direction even when the directional change exceeds 90 degrees and 315 feet is not required unless there is a compelling public safety reason to do so the suffix drive or road may be used in such cases to denote the meandering nature of such streets principle no 5 base line extensions streets that cross the baselines may continue across baselines but should be designated eastwest or northsouth or change names therefore if a north prefix occurs it should be matched with the street bearing a south prefix eg north patterson and south patterson a typical exception would be west mountain drive where west is part of the principle name however the use of directional words as principle names should be avoided whenever possible principle no 6 interrupted streets streets that are permanently interrupted by parks cemeteries platted and developed land should have separate names attached to the segments even though they line up geographically if the land block interruption is not platted or developed such that the road could continue in the future the street name may be continued principle no 7 intersections street names should not change at intersections where there is no offset unless crossing a baseline or major geographical boundary supplement no 28 title 12   1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks c prefixes and suffixes address prefixes are words preceding a street name and indicating a direction such as north south east and west address suffixes are words following a street name and may indicate only a type of street the latter type of suffix is also called a thoroughfare designation attachment a contains a list of authorized suffix designations and their corresponding abbreviations and usage groupings streets are sometimes ranked by function and size and each category is assigned a specific name suffix thoroughfare designation accordingly editors note attachment a has been amended by resolution no 6424 dated 11606 which adopts the postal service standard suffix abbreviations as published by the us postal service and is on file in the office of the city clerk the following is a list of definitions with synonyms that are permitted to be used throughout the city and general rules for suffix usage boulevard a street with a median reflecting the boulevard character implied in the name unusually wide thoroughfares in residential sections with shade trees or shrubbery in the center plot and the name can even be used with numbered thoroughfares synonyms are parkway expressway circle a circle is a secondary road that begins and circles back to terminate on the same road street or drive square may be used if applicable to the geometry of the street layout as part of the principle name but square may not be used as a suffix court permanently closed streets such as culdesacs or a minor street less than 1000 feet in length ending in a turnaround synonyms are place plaza point cove trail drive winding thoroughfares or curving streets longer than 1000 feet with intersecting roads streets and drives roads that meander about and continue other rightsofway synonyms are avenue way street road cutoff highway designated and numbered street or federal highways interstate roads of the highest order characterized by limited access synonyms are freeway expressway thruway turnpike lane private rightsofway streets or roads not maintained as public streets by the city of hot springs other authorized suffixes may be used in lieu of lane where such suffix is more appropriate or descriptive eg cove point bay etc all private street signage shall bear the additional notation of pvt as specified in  12111 c 5 of the citys street acceptance policy  however the pvt notation shall not be considered as a street name suffix res no 257 12291 title 12   supplement no 28 1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks loop loops shall be short drives that begin and end by intersecting upon itself and generally of a curving nature parkway see also boulevard a special scenic route or park drive designated

state primary highway synonyms are crossway cutoff street avenue drive way the standard suffixes avenue boulevard causeway cutoff drive road street way etc cannot be attached to a road that dead ends from the last branching road the following dead end suffixes are to be used court place plaza trail extension tram and lane lane shall be applied to a private roadway that is either undedicated or dedicated but unaccepted for city maintenance but which may become a public road in the future once a lane is accepted by the city the lane is dropped and it becomes a regular street name without a suffix the suffix grouping for major roads includes expressway freeway highway parkway roadway thruway and turnpike the suffix names circle terrace and loop are generally applied to roads that either start wind around and end on the same road or an adjacent road loop is a road that starts and loops back on itself with platted or private property in the middle of the roadway if there is no private property in the middle of such a road it is to be considered as a regular culdesac the loop can be in the form of a circle or square a terrace is a suffix that could apply to a dead end but generally applies to either a back access to lots that face in the opposite direction the suffixes point and cove are to be applied only in lake areas suffixes should be applied only in accordance with these

assigned by the proper city official in newly platted developments this shall be accomplished prior to all water or sewer connections all street namesnumbers shall be assignedapproved before a plat is accepted for filing by the circuit clerk 2 group buildings numbering principle an example of numbering encountered in apartment complexes shopping centers or office parks is shown in the following illustration one of the designation problems involves making a decision as to which of two streets to use in giving the unit an address when a corner location is encountered the building apartments office or shopping centers are grouped around parking bays and the units or lots may actually face neither street the sketch shows how one case may be handled in the case of the residential building complex the entire complex has only one number comprised of the block number and the front footage number even or odd falling closest to the entryway supplement no 23 title 12   1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks separate internal units of condominiums and apartments should have an alphabetical designation for a multiunit building with subnumbers for individual dwelling units the same consideration will apply to mobile home parks with the exception that the alphabetical designation for a multiunit building would not be required each mobile home should receive a numerical designation such as lot 1 lot 2 lot 3 or space a b c in addition to the general number the end result is that the building complexes do not have street frontage numbers for each individual dwelling unit as shown on the illustration nonresidential building complexes do have street frontage property numbers for each building but have an alphabetical suffix for the individual units or suites the distinction between residential and nonresidential numbering is made due to a u s postal service policy concerning mail delivery for the residential complex mail delivery is made to a central point but mail delivery is made to each unit or suite in a nonresidential complex a separate building such as #2808 shown on sketch will not be addressed off the side street unless accessed curb cut 3 private developments as stated above private multifamily housing developments will be given a single address for the total complex such as a large condominium site retirement village mobile home park or cluster of apartments the single address will be the official address with each occupancy being assigned a unit or space numbers apt 44 or a combination of building numbers  unit numbers such as 86 space assignments shall consist of a number less than 99 or a letter and a number for the convenience of poa or management streets or drives within the development may be named but such names shall not duplicate any other name within garland county if street names are referenced for convenience all unit or space numbers shall be less than 99 the official addresses shall be assigned by 911 operations title 12   supplement no 23 1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks 4 number assignments the process of assigning numbers is as follows a field work  measurements of houses and roads will be done in a systematic manner b field work will be taken to office and house or building numbers will be assigned c the newly assigned addresses will be delivered to the residents as soon as possible in a package containing the occupants new address a change of address form and a letter of explanation 5 base maps base maps used for the purpose of naming and numbering roads in hot springsgarland county are a general highway map of garland county arkansas prepared by the arkansas state highway and transportation department revised 1988 b transportation boundary map for hot springs garland county arkansas prepared by the arkansas state highway and transportation department c other specifically prepared maps such as atlas sheets improvement district ownership maps aerial photogrammetry or other reliable systems 6 private drives private drives are not usually considered for numbering purposes if access to a business or industrial establishment is not approached on any public street the address is assigned using the interval where the drive joins the public street if principle access to the structure is from the private drive but is hidden behind other structures or is located on the interior of the block the centerline of the driveway is used to assign the number supplement no 23 title 12   1226 hot springs code 1226 streets and sidewalks 7 corner general rule to apply when assigning a number to a building on a corner lot is to assign a number from the street upon which the front entrance faces dual addresses should not be assigned a choice must be made if a corner building has two entrances for one entity and both look like front entrances the decision about which number to assign is based on the general site layout 8 rear houses and buildings on interior landlocked parcels having rear dwellings a subordinate designation can be assigned that is alphabetical the only exception to the rule is that if a structure is hidden or plainly subsidiary or auxiliary in nature to a primary structure or when there are two or more entrances to a separate unit of the same structure each unit shall be duplicated alphabetically in all such cases only one number should be assigned if there is a rear entrance or a hidden residential structure a post should display the number on the path leading to the entrance even if it is reached structure for units on alleys or interior malls where there is no access to a street paralleling the alley the address number is assigned based on the intersection of that alley with the named street numbers are assigned from the series on that street in the case of commercial or industrial facilities auxiliary buildings would not be assigned separate numbers but the main building  where the mail is received and business is transacted  would receive a building number f system implementation the hot springs board of directors adopts this policy that effectuates the system and that authorizes the city manager to administer the program the following is a list of steps to institute the system 1 street names are inventoried and reviewed for duplications and thoroughfare designations and prefixsuffix adjustments are made unnamed streets and private streets are named 2 citizens are informed of the proposed changes that are under review title 12   supplement no 23 1226 hot springs code 12210 streets and sidewalks 3 field measurements are taken and the numbering is recorded on the prepared maps 4 the assignment of numbers to structures are made and the occupants are informed 5 notice of the new street and number changes are sent to all affected residences and businesses city departments the u s postal service the public utilities the newspapers the sheriffs department and other appropriate agencies it is important that enough lead time be given so that residents and businesses can make appropriate changes in stationery labels advertising etc 6 as new streets are added in future years this policy shall be applied on a case by case basis g conclusion while these general principles and rules for numbering structures provide guidance in constructing a street naming and numbering system it is not possible to develop rules for all of the problems that will be encountered in perfecting such a numbering system there is no substitute for good judgment in applying these guidelines

designed to lessen or deter hazards to persons property and the environment caused by increased runoff obstructions to drainage and introduction of excessive silts debris and pollutants into the drainage system lakes ponds streams rivers and other water bodies in the city of hot springs and to otherwise promote the public health safety and welfare of the public are hereby adopted and this ordinance may be referred to as the hot springs stormwater management 1 introduction and findings the board of directors finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health safety and welfare because a impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff which reduces percolation of water increases erosion and flooding  b improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding which can endanger property and human life  c increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems which decreases the systems capacity  and d many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff

of a precise design of the development this allows the developer more flexibility in phasing and adapting to market conditions it also reduces the need for extensive plan amendments requirements for adjustments to the plan by their nature village districts will be large scale developments with enough land to permit buffers with adjoining neighborhoods the key issues in locating village districts
