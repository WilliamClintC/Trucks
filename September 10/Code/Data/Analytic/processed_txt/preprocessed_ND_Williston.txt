under district zoning regulations planned unit developments are intended to allow substantial flexibility in planning and designing a proposal this flexibility often accrues in the form of relief from

lenient siting requirements may be granted however the planned unit development should contain features not normally required of traditional developments to insure compatibility with surrounding land uses and to preserve health safety and general welfare of the community residents analysis of the proposal requires more information than would be required if development were being pursued under conventional zoning requirements b objectives 1 provide flexibility in architectural design placement and clustering of buildings  use of open areas and outdoor living areas  provision of circulation facilities and parking  and related site and design considerations  2 to promote logical development patterns of residential commercial office industrial and mixed use developments while protecting the character and quality of adjacent uses  3 to ensure adequate provision of public services such as water sewer electricity open space and parks  4 to avoid inappropriate development of lands and to

director in accordance with table 1 of this  site plan approval assessment of the amount of screening required will be based upon the treatment of height bulk and density at the edge of the proposed development the following criteria should be considered in site design a open space setbacks by providing an open space buffer between conflicting land uses conflicts can often be avoided the width of the buffer required will depend on the extent of other measures applied to work effectively the purpose use and maintenance of the open space buffer must be clearly defined b orientation the orientation of buildings and activities in the two land uses can be effective in creating more natural and less abrupt or artificial buffers the buildings can create an effective buffer if constructed back to back thus orienting views access and s adopting ordinance s ao819 principal activities away from the other land use however a hazardous and unaesthetic no mans land must not be created in the process some appropriate use must be given to the intervening space an entire site plan can be oriented so least compatible activities and functions are placed furthest from the common boundary between land uses and those most compatible near that boundary c architectural compatibility in addition to the architectural considerations involved in mitigation the materials colors scale and prominence of buildings in adjacent land uses can be coordinated so there is a gradual transition from one land use to another rather than a sharp and displeasing contrast the architectural compatibility should rise from a total consideration of the function of each land use and the function of the space between them d circulation streets and parking areas can often serve to reduce certain types of land use conflicts e nuisance factors loading and traffic areas noise dust lighting and such activities that may be disruptive to adjacent uses should result in a site plan and buffer that take those nuisances into consideration by locating away from less intense land uses and adding greater buffering to the site a site plan needs to be provided indicating buffering that mitigates these nuisances table 1 buffer yard requirements s williston code s ao820 buffered zones description of buffer between r3r4r5r7 and r1 buffering shall consist of 1 of the following r2r6 and between
