  findings the city council of the city of riverside finds and declares that a cities and counties must divert 50 percent of all solid waste by  reduction recycling and composting activities b diverting 50 percent of all solid waste requires the participation of the residential commercial industrial and public sectors c the lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable

legal principles relating to regulation of activity and events on public property and public parks specifically and the city council does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive

need to coordinate multiple uses of limited park space assure the preservation of park facilities prevent dangerous unlawful or impermissible activities on park property and assure financial accountability for damages caused by activity on park property b the city is not directing its regulation at communicative activity but to all activity in riverside public parks c the city does hereby take legislative notice of the various decisions of the united states supreme court regarding regulation of activity in public spaces in general and activity in public parks in particular d the citys public parks have been used by millions of individuals living in riverside county and throughout the southern california region these public parks are heavily used for a variety of purposes including heavy use by families with children park usage is limited by the large number of people that use the public parks and by other aspects of the parks including shape location and facilities e some of the city parks are adjacent to busy streets and are located in residential or mixed residential and commercial areas as well a portion of the citys park space is not available for general passive use because it is dedicated to special uses such as playgrounds tennis courts basketball and volleyball courts swimming pools softball soccer and sports fields lawn bowling community centers horseshoe pits exercise courses picnic facilities and barbeque pits exercise and walking trails concert areas and skateboard facilities and other areas are dedicated to gardens and lakes and other water features f most of the specialized areas of city parks are heavily and constantly used as well passive park space is also very heavily utilized by individuals who jog walk read and lounge and by informal groups who stroll play games chat and have parties and picnics in the city parks as well organized groups such as schools companies churches and the city itself use the public parks for picnics festivals community events recreation classes rallies and demonstrations g in recent years various parks have been used by private groups to distribute free food to the public which attracts crowds and involves significant amounts of paraphernalia and materials used to hold and serve food all during times when the use of the park by other members of the public is quite large h the groups distributing food to the public have not cleaned up or restored the parks to their original condition after the food distribution but instead leave significant amounts of litter and trash strewn over the park property frequently accompanied by provision of clothing which is simply piled in the park area and at the end of the event trash and the remnants of this virtual garage sale remains i the ongoing and repetitive outdoor distribution of food to large numbers of people has significant adverse impacts upon city parks and upon park users moreover private food distributions on public property in the city pose significant public health risks the health risks of distributing food in city parks arise from a variety of factors including the limited sanitary facilities the presence of birds and animals and the lack of facilities for storing food and keeping it at proper temperatures j because the citys public parks are constantly used by large numbers of people for a variety of activities events in parks must be carefully and reasonably managed this includes but is in no way or intent limited to the management of the free food distribution to large numbers of the general public k the city regulates the use of its public parks to protect the health safety and public welfare by regulating traffic noise aesthetics and other impacts l events in the public parks may require the provision of additional public services including police fire transportation and public works and additional maintenance of the facilities that are used m moreover group events in the public parks often use facilities that would otherwise be available to the public n managing events and activities in the public parks requires ensuring that these events and activities are compatible in size and type of use with their sites adequate services are provided for the events adequate cost recovery for these services is achieved the events and activities do not interfere with the citys ability to provide services to the entire community and the impacts on neighbors and others are minimized o the city desires to provide a coordinated process for managing events and activities in its public parks to ensure the health and safety of event patrons residents workers and other visitors to prohibit illegal activities from occurring at park events and to protect the rights of park event permit holders p the city acknowledges that individuals and groups have the right to engage in expressive activities in the citys public parks and that to allow unregulated access to all visitors

races occur on a regular basis on various streets within the city hundreds of racers and spectators gather on these streets late at night and in the early morning hours blocking the streets and sidewalks to traffic forming a racetrack area placing bets and otherwise encouraging aiding and abetting the racing process illegal street racers accelerate to high speeds without regard to oncoming traffic pedestrians or vehicles parked or moving nearby the racers drive quickly from street to street race for several hours and then move to other locations upon the arrival of the police those who participate in this illegal activity are very sophisticated using cell phones police scanners and other electronic devices to communicate with each other to avoid arrest they also use the internet to provide information on where to race and give advice on how to avoid detection and prosecution traffic accidents property crimes and calls for police service have increased dramatically in most cases

the picture in the id both ecoatm machines approved the transaction and dispensed cash for the deposited phone 5 in july of 201 glendale police reported several instances where juvenile suspects sold stolen devices to an ecoatm machine using the identification of others adults that looked nothing like the person using the machine the stolen devices had already been exchanged for cash by the time the devices were reported stolen to the police e ecoatms security features cannot successfully deter thieves  the machine does not does not have the technology to verify whether the valid government issued id fingerprint and photograph collected by the machine belong to the person completing the transaction and whether the person is the true owner of the device being sold f there is no security device that ecoatm could install to catch thieves who use third parties or middlemen to complete the transaction g theft of personal electronic devices is already a growing problem in the city of riverside even without the addition of ecoatm machines on  the university of california riverside held a town meeting to discuss campus safety and the rise in cell phone theft h currently there are no ecoatm locations in the city of riverside it is reasonable to conclude that the adverse effects of ecoatm machines on the public health safety and welfare of other cities will certainly occur in the city of riverside if the city fails to prohibit the machines the incentive that these machines create far outweighs the benefits derived from their security features the security features of the ecoatm machines fail to deter and aid in prosecuting thieves theft of personal electronic devices is on the rise in the city and will likely increase from the quick and easy cash incentive provided by ecoatm machines  2013   authority and purpose a this chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the city of riverside in a and of the california constitution and of the riverside city

safety hazard because drivers may attempt to not only read a for sale sign in or on a vehicle but also commit to memory write down or call a telephone number on such a sign these signs pose a greater risk of accidents than do other types of signs that may be displayed in or on a parked vehicle d the significant increase in vehicles parked for the purpose of sale has created a nuisance by decreasing the parking available for local residents and businesses e the city has an important and substantial public interest in protecting public safety reducing accidents removing impediments to

concern and interest of the city council to protect the broad range of performance protected by the first amendment while also vigilantly protecting and preserving the public health safety and welfare of the citys residents business owners and visitors during the festival of lights festival located on main street riverside pedestrian mall in downtown riverside and at the historic mission inn hotel and spa the mission inn the festival is a free approximately sixweek long holiday extravaganza featuring one of the nations largest holiday light collections of its kind the festival includes attractions entertainment activities and events horse drawn carriages and vendors who sell food and merchandise each year the festival draws over 500000 people from all over the world with 75000 attending the switchon ceremony alone due to its popularity the festival has continued to grow each year and with that has come a substantial increase in pedestrian traffic to an already confined stretch of the pedestrian mall as part of the festival the city recognizes that street performers desire to engage in expressive activities with the continued popularity of the festival there has recently been an increase in the number of performers cognizant that street performers are engaged in first and fourteenth amendment activities that can often enhance the visitor experience this chapter sets forth appropriate street performer locations on peak days and hours as a reasonable time place and manner restrictions in a manner that balances their constitutional rights with the health safety and welfare of the citys residents business owners and visitors to the festival  2017   findings the city recognizes that street performers are afforded rights related to freedom of speech and freedom of expression the city also recognizes that the current climate of the country is such that the general public is operating at a heighted state of alert in large crowds the city desires to enhance the safety of the citys residents businesses and visitors by implementing safe areas at the festival for street performers during the times when the festival experiences the largest crowds at the switch on ceremony and on high traffic days of the festival the pedestrian mall is often extremely crowded with pedestrian traffic it is crucial to the continued interest of the community for the city to safeguard this area with reasonable restrictions and regulations to ensure the health safety and welfare of individuals during the festival the existence of street performers at the festival provides a public amenity that enhances the character of the festival and the city seeks to encourage such performances in a manner consistent with the publics overall safety street performers seek to and do draw large crowds to their performances this can create serious safety problems by impacting the ability of individuals to move safely on sidewalks in high pedestrian traffic areas in that street performers attract large stationary crowds which have a tendency to block passageways and impede the path of travel for example on the pedestrian mall street performers on highly attended festival evenings attract audiences that congest the area and increase the likelihood for conflict and disorderliness the citys police and fire departments have made great efforts to provide access to the areas surrounding the mission inn and the pedestrian mall in an effort to ensure the publics safety at the festival the ability to limit street performers on the days the festival experiences the largest crowds ultimately assists public safety personnel by allowing critical access to the streets surrounding the mission inn and the pedestrian mall due to the unusually large crowds on this day travel is inhibited not only for pedestrians but also for public safety personnel needed to provide safety and emergency response the police chief and fire chief have found that audiences attracted by street performers contribute to impeding the ability of emergency response personnel to respond to critical incidents during the festival public safety personnel are patrolling the pedestrian mall on bicycles atvs vehicles and by foot at any given time safety personnel need to have the ability to deploy all or a portion of their resources in case of an emergency or fire large crowds could potentially limit public safetys ability to mitigate an incident before it escalates the past presence of street performers on the days and nights when the largest crowds attend the festival has caused a hazard and danger to the residents business owners and visitors to the festival the mass congestion caused by the street performers and their audience impedes pedestrian traffic and ingress and egress from businesses and which could create an impedance to pedestrian traffic flow in cases of emergency which could in turn cause injury to persons and property street performers and their equipment may impede the ingress and egress of emergency and public safety vehicles on the pedestrian mall by creating physical obstacles to emergency response and administration of aid to those in need of immediate medical attention and to victims of criminal activity it is therefore necessary to ensure that street performers congregate in less congested areas than the pedestrian mall on high traffic days to avoid interference with emergency response vehicles that provide assistance to individuals with medical needs and victims of criminal activity these designated areas however will be within the fol boundaries and located proximate to any prohibited area established federal and state law allows municipalities to regulate the time place and manner of speech and other forms of expression where such regulations are narrowly tailored contentneutral and leave open ample alternative channels of communications for street performers desiring to display expressive activities in proximate performance areas where street performers may reasonably reach their intended audience the city desires to balance the freedom of speech and freedom of expression protections afforded by united states and state constitutions to those street performers desiring to engage in expressive activities at the festival that is intended to or has the effect of gathering large crowds and audiences with protected and significant governmental interests related to traffic and sidewalk congestion pedestrian safety aesthetics the ability of emergency response personnel to reach locations limiting access to and egress from business and residences and other interests to ensure smooth pedestrian traffic flow relieve congestion and overcrowding limit disorderliness and prevent potential interference with and visibility obstruction for motorists attempting to navigate streets within the fol boundaries during the festival it is the intention of the city to balance these regulations and governmental interests with the recognized rights to street performers to exercise their rights of free speech and expression to their intended audience the reasonable and contentneutral time place and manner restrictions outlined herein that apply to certain conduct on the pedestrian mall will be effective are narrowly tailored to address the governmental interests outlined herein and constitute the least restrictive alternative for the purposes intended and set for herein the city acknowledges that street performers may intend to reach a particular audience during the festival and the city council desires that such street performers be afforded an ample opportunity to engage in expressive activities during the festival to ensure that messages and performances can be conveyed to the street performers intended audience by enacting this ordinance the express public policy and purpose of the city shall continue to be the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare of the citys residents business owners and visitors who attend the festival while still providing reasonable and meaningful alternate avenues areas and access for street performers by allowing performances anywhere within the fol boundaries except on the days and times defined herein as high traffic days the city therefore finds that in order to ensure the safety of the residents businesses and visitors to the festival it is necessary to prohibit street performers from performing on the pedestrian mall on high traffic days  2017   definitions for purposes of this chapter the

dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  2008     definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases

management purposes only and are different from the variances in title 19 of this premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a floodplain variance the need to prevent flood damage is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that floodplain variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if floodplain variances are strictly limited floodplain variances are specific to property and are not personal in nature  2008   floodplain variances considerations and findings a in passing upon requests for floodplain variances the city of riverside shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b findings  the floodplain administrator planning commission or the city council may approve a floodplain variance or designee if it makes all of the following findings failure to make all of the required findings shall require denial of the floodplain variance 1 the property has physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners  2 the characteristics are unique to the property and not typical of other property in the vicinity and under the identical firm zone  3 the unique characteristics pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners  and 4 granting of a floodplain variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters  2008   conditions for floodplain variances a generally floodplain variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the floodplain variance increases b floodplain variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c upon consideration of the factors of subsection a and the purposes of this chapter the city of riverside may attach such conditions to the granting of floodplain variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter d floodplain variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result e floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of floodplain variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of riverside need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of riverside believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter f any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a floodplain variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of riverside recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land g the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all floodplain variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such floodplain variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the

nexus study 2016 update  nexus study the mitigation fee act for the purpose of updating the fees on  the wrcog executive committee reviewed the 2016 nexus study and tumf program and recommended tumf

previous findings made in the adoption of as amended and superseded by ordinances nos 6869 and 706 the city council has been informed and advised and hereby finds that if the capacity of the regional system is not enlarged and unless development contributes to the cost of improving the regional system the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of western riverside county with unacceptable levels of service furthermore the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional system will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to

reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional system and the type of development projects on which the tumf is imposed because it will be necessary for the

be mitigated in part by payment of the tumf f the city council finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the 2016 nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional system improvements and the facilities that compromise the regional system and that the amount of the tumf expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development g the fees collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be used to help pay for the design planning construction of and real acquisition for the regional system improvements and

subdivision provisions and the application of judgment to a given set of facts no public hearing is required for administrative maps permits and actions unless the decision is appealed in accordance with provisions of table  approving and appeal authority describes the various administrative permits which can be approved by the community & economic development director c discretionary maps

table lu5 zoninggeneral plan consistency matrix identifies general plan land use designations and corresponding zones that have been determined as consistent  or 2 if the zoning designation is not identified as consistent pursuant to table lu5 zoninggeneral plan consistency matrix then table lu6 consistency quick check can be used to determine consistency when a use is allowed in the existing zone and is allowed in another zone consistent with the sites general plan designation  or 3 if the use does not meet the criteria of table lu6 then consistency can be determined by evaluating a proposed project pursuant to table lu7 consistency criteria all criteria must be found consistent or not applicable to determine consistency b base zones every parcel shall have a base zone that establishes the primary type and intensity of land use permitted along with development regulations for that particular type and intensity of land use c overlay zones an overlay zone supplements the base zone for the purpose of establishing special use or development regulations for a particular area in addition to the provisions of the underlying base zone in the event of conflict between the

synergistic land uses such as residential with compatible nonresidential uses including office retail personal services public spaces and other community amenities these uses are allowed as either a singular standalone uses that contribute to a mixture of uses within the zone  or b combined uses in one project as a mixeduse development 2 to strengthen the interaction between residential commercial and employment uses in order to reduce dependency on automobiles improve air quality decrease urban sprawl facilitate use of transit and encourage conservation of land resources 3 to provide opportunities for transitoriented development 4 to revitalize deteriorating commercial areas by integrating residential uses and public institutions into the commercial fabric to create an active street life and enhance the vitality of businesses 5 to provide alternatives to new development of small shopping centers 6 to foster pedestrianoriented activity nodes by providing a mix of uses in compact walkable areas 7 to increase the area available for residential development and provide alternative types of housing 8 to provide appropriate locations for a broad range of livework activities to occur 9 to encourage medium and highdensity residential development to occur in close proximity to employment and services 10 to allow for a greater variety of land uses and structures including adaptive reuse of existing structures and flexibility in site planning b zones established three mixeduse zones are established to provide development opportunities for integrated complementary residential and commercial development on the same parcel or a contiguous group of parcels singular standalone uses are permitted when they foster an overall mixture of uses in the zone a wide range of uses is permitted and it is the intent of these zones to foster a mixture of product types development solely as commercial or residential districts is strongly discouraged design and development standards for all three zones are directed toward encouraging pedestrian activity and ensuring that mixed commercial and residential uses are designed to be compatible both within the development and with other surrounding areas 1 mixed useneighborhood mun the mun zone provides opportunities for primarily neighborhoodserving commercial uses with limited lowintensity residential uses in a mixeduse environment it is intended to preserve the existing housing stock and residential character of neighborhoods while allowing for development of new housing opportunities and encouraging pedestrianoriented retail and service uses the focus of the development and design standards is on ensuring that new and infill development are distributed and designed in a manner sensitive in scale and design to the street environment and adjacent singlefamily residential areas 2 mixed usevillage muv the muv zone provides for medium to highdensity residential development with retail office and service uses primarily at the street level to facilitate a pedestrian environment it is intended to encourage new housing opportunities such as livework units and residential over retail that are nearby to commercial services plazas courtyards outdoor dining transit stops and other public gathering spaces and community amenities such as art in public spaces are strongly encouraged the focus of the development and design standards is on landscaping and buffering techniques to provide transitions from developed commercial areas to lower density residential neighborhoods 3 mixed useurban muu the muu zone provides opportunities for primarily highdensity residential development with commercial office institutional and business uses emphasizing retail entertainment and studentoriented activities such development is intended to facilitate the grouping of innovative housing options with employment uses entertainment activities and public gathering

that a that the waters of the city and state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  1 that the continuation of the citys and states economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  2 that it is the policy of the city and state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  3 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in the city and state by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  4 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 5 the city recognizes that of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use b consistent with these legislative findings the purpose of this chapter of the zoning to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 reduce water demands from landscapes without a decline in landscape quality or quantity  4 retain flexibility and encourage creativity design  5 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  6 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance mawa as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  7 assure the attainment of water efficient landscape goals by requiring that landscapes not exceed a maximum water demand evapotranspiration adjustment factor of 55 for residential and 45 nonresidential of its reference evapotranspiration et o  or any lower percentage as may be required  8 achieve water conservation by raising the public awareness of the need to conserve water motivation to embrace an effective water demand management program  and 9 promote the use of recycled water for landscaping c landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this chapter conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and esthetic benefits 2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3 conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment 4 protecting air and water quality by reduction power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced
