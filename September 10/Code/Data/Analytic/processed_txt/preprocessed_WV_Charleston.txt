a the city council finds and declares that there has been for a number of years a clear trend for younger and more affluent persons and families residing in the city to move their residences from the inner urban areas of the city to newer suburban areas  that as a result a disproportionate number of homeowners remaining in such inner urban areas are older less affluent and otherwise less able to afford the expense of the remodeling repairing and rehabilitating of their residences necessary to maintain such residences in a sanitary safe and decent condition  that because of their lack of acceptable loan collateral the age of their residences and the location and age of the neighborhoods in which their residences are located many of such homeowners have not been able to borrow funds necessary to effect such remodeling repair and rehabilitation  and that some homeowners who have been able to borrow funds for such purposes have been able to do so only upon rates of interest and upon other terms and conditions which are particularly onerous to such homeowners b the city council further finds and declares that the assistance authorized by this article will provide and will encourage private lenders to provide to such homeowners more readily and at rates of interest and upon other terms and conditions significantly more favorable to such homeowners the loans necessary to finance the cost of such remodeling repair and rehabilitation c the city council further finds and declares that it is manifestly in the public interest to foster in the populous inner urban areas of this city the pride selfrespect and esteem incident to home ownership and to encourage and assist in the maintenance of residences situated in such areas in a safe decent and sanitary condition  that without the assistance authorized in this article there will be continued deterioration of such inner urban areas with the resultant proliferation of urban decay and slums higher crime rates and general decline in civic pride public spirit and the quality of life with all of the public cost direct and indirect attendant thereon  and that accordingly by providing such assistance the city will be acting in all respects for the benefit of its citizens and shall thereby serve a public purpose in improving and otherwise promoting their health welfare and prosperity  neighborhood rehabilitation

bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required

application requirements permitted uses design standards criteria for review changes in the approved planned unit development revocation and extension purpose the purpose of the planned unit development district is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design of land developments than is possible under conventional zoning regulations planned unit developments are intended to allow substantial flexibility in planning to promote more economical and efficient use of land ideally this flexibility results in a development that is better planned contains more amenities and is a more desirable to live in than one produced in accordance with typical zoning ordinance and subdivision controls an intrinsic premise upon which the approval of a planned unit development must be conditioned is that while greater density or more lenient siting requirements may be granted the planned unit development should contain features not normally required of traditional developments through proper planning and design each planned unit development shall include features which further and are in compliance with the following objectives a to allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible application of standard zoning and subdivision controls b to encourage land development that to the greatest extent possible preserves natural vegetation respects natural topographic and geologic conditions and refrains from adversely affective flooding soil drainage and other natural ecologic conditions c to combine and coordinate architectural styles building forms and structuralvisual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of different land uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner d to provide for abundant accessible and properly located open and recreation space e to promote the efficient use of land resulting in networks of utilities streets and other infrastructure features that maximize the allocation of fiscal and natural resources f to enable land developments to be completely compatible and congruous with adjacent and nearby land developments g to ensure that development occurs at proper locations away from environmentally sensitive areas and on land physically suited to construction h to allow unique and unusual land uses to be planned for and located in a manner that ensures harmony with the surrounding community i to create a method for the permanent preservation of historic buildings andor landmarks where appropriate

neighborhood reinvestment overlay district seeks to uplift distressed communities where disinvestment has resulted in a concentration of dilapidated properties vacant structures and underutilized land the nro promotes vibrant and desirable urban neighborhoods by encouraging housing types ranging from small lot bungalows to duplexes and triplexes and from townhouses to stacked apartments this mix of housing types referred to as the missing middle bridges the gap between the available housing stock and shifting demographics it responds to the growing demand for walkability in neighborhoods and because missing middle housing types are similar in form and scale to detached singlefamily homes this approach to compatible infill can encourage socioeconomically diverse households missing middle housing does not represent a new type of building rather it is a return to a range of housing types that were constructed in cities and towns across the united states in the 1920s s examples of these building types still exist throughout charlestons urban neighborhoods on the west side flats and the east end as young families fled densely populated areas for single family homes with ample yards in the suburbs after world war ii construction of these building types halted a return to smaller dwelling units near public transit and a density that will support local businesses is necessary to attract and retain millennials and to serve an aging population specifically the nro attempts to stimulate the economy and boost the housing market by 1 encouraging the development of a range of housing types that meet the needs of households of varying size and income levels while resisting concentrations of either the very poor or the very wealthy 2 concentrating development around public transportation routes to enhance mobility and offer opportunities for lower income households 3 increasing density to support neighborhoodserving main streetscommercial and mixed use areas where goods and services are available within walking distance of the majority of a neighborhoods residential units 4 creating opportunities for smallscale neighborhoodbased developers to invest in and revitalize their own communities to accomplish these goals the nro relaxes development standards like setback and parking requirements and permits increased density by allowing duplexes by right and concentrating higher density development on corner properties establishment of neighborhood reinvestment overlay district the neighborhood reinvestment overlay district is hereby established as a
