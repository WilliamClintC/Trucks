ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  building thirteen  planning and zoning fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the

and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person

disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist da person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or

on an agreement between local communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss znew construction structures for which the

hardship based on conditions created by the owner is not an unnecessary hardship it must be found that there are peculiar and special hardships as applicable to the property involved which are separate and distinct from the general hardship in the district  and b where exceptional circumstances or conditions only applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property do not apply to other property within the same zone the mere fact that the owner of the one parcel might apply prior to the owner of the other parcels in the same area would not give him a right to a variance and thus grant a special privilege to an individual when such variance would be necessarily denied to others it must be found on the other hand that there are exceptional conditions justifying a variance on one lot such as topographical or geological conditions or type of adjoining developments and that a variance would be justified on any lot where the same exceptional circumstances prevail  and c where granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located the mere existence of an unnecessary hardship or other exceptional circumstances is not ipso facto evidence for granting of a variance for such hardships must be balanced against the present conditions and extent such a variance would interfere with the proper future development and rights of adjacent property  and d that the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the general purpose intent and objectives of this zoning other adopted plans a variance merely permits that which is contemplated in this zoning unnecessary hardships and exceptional circumstances on the
