ensure that new development is consistent with the communitys goals and that issues are identified early in the process b the planning commission and board of trustees will evaluate each proposal based on these principles and the context within which a project is located the principles are intended to be specific enough to guide development but not to preclude creative design solutions applicants must substantially conform to the design principles unless it can be demonstrated that an acceptable alternative meets one 1 or more of the following conditions 1 the alternative better achieves the stated intent  2 the intent will not be achieved by application of the principle in this circumstance  3 the effect of other principles will be improved by not applying the principle  andor 4 strict application or unique site features make the principle impractical 3 2003 design elements one 1 of the greatest challenges facing small towns is the successful integration of new development with the original town pattern suburban development patterns which have included numerous culdesacs and limited street connections have often separated communities and created enclaves of the original towns in order to maintain the towns unique smalltown character and clearly describe the towns vision the following design elements have been set forth within this 1 compact urban growth as the community grows from the original town limits it is important to maintain a continuity of density diversity and interconnectedness urban development should occur adjacent to the towns core so that the communitys prime agricultural land and natural areas are preserved and public infrastructure and utilities are used as efficiently as possible 2 neighborhood design new developments should help create neighborhoods rather than residential subdivisions adjacent to one another neighborhoods should be organized around a strong center which may include elements such as common open space civic and commercial or mixed uses strong consideration should be given to pedestrian movement the character of streets and sidewalks as inviting public space and the interconnectedness of the streets within the neighborhood and as they connect to the rest of the community in addition new neighborhoods should have a variety of housing sizes and types that help to create a distinct identity rather than a monotonous replication of styles 3 blocks streets and sidewalks the layout of lots and blocks should be designed to continue the towns existing block pattern to form a grid or modified grid pattern that is adapted to the topography natural features and environmental considerations the streets should be treelined and interconnected in order to create a comprehensive transportation network that facilitates the movement of pedestrians cars and bicycles 4 parks and open space new developments shall use natural open spaces and developed public space such as parks and plazas to organize and focus lots blocks and circulation patterns protect natural areas and quality agricultural land and create an identity for each neighborhood 5 site design architecture and landscaping one 1 of the fundamental intentions of this to encourage innovative quality site design architecture and landscaping in order to create new places that can be integrated with the existing community and reflect the traditional patterns of the region the photographic design vocabulary of this  as well as illustrations throughout the intended to provide a visual description of the towns design intentions 6 environment new developments should be designed to fit within the environment to the greatest extent feasible sites should be designed to preserve natural areas and the plants and wildlife inhabiting those areas in addition new developments are encouraged to follow green builder guidelines see c of this  and to conserve natural resources especially water 7 water conservation as the state grows increasing pressure will be placed on the limited supply of water resources milliken residents have emphasized the importance of preserving the quality and quantity of water all new development is encouraged to use raw water for irrigation and to incorporate watersaving measures in building design and landscaping developments are required to use stormwater management techniques that address water quality as well as quantity 4 2003 compact urban growth a intent the town has adopted a compact urban growth policy that encourages and directs development to take place within areas contiguous to existing development in the community this policy will accomplish several goals including 1 improving air quality by reducing vehicle miles traveled and by promoting alternatives to the private automobile  2 preserving natural areas and features particularly in the periphery of the town  3 making possible the efficient use of existing infrastructure and costeffective extensions of new services  4 encouraging infill development and reinvestment in builtup areas of the town  and 5 promoting physical separation from neighboring communities to help each maintain its individual identity and character b general provisions 1 the town has established a planning area boundary and adopted a cooperative planning area policy with weld county and the town of johnstown the purpose is to direct growth within the established planning area boundary no development shall be approved unless it is located within the established planning area boundary and is consistent with the comprehensive plan exceptions to this policy may be considered at the discretion of the board of trustees if it can be demonstrated that the development will provide an exceptional benefit to the town 2 the town has established land use overlay districts not analogous with zoning districts within the planning area boundary to ensure that the community grows in a way that enhances its special qualities and maintains a continuity of density diversity and interconnectedness a downtown mixeduse allows for a transition to mixeduse development within the downtown area b ridge line preservation district limits development on ridge lines these districts are to be used as a general guide in conjunction with the underlying land use designations on the comprehensive plan land use map c town structure town structure shall be formed by the clustering of neighborhoods as opposed to developing singleuse residential subdivisions adjacent to and disconnected from each other the clustering of neighborhoods to support the original town center and form additional multineighborhood centers is illustrated on the comprehensive plan land use map the original downtown needs to be strengthened by commercial and mixeduse development within the immediate vicinity as illustrated 5 2003 neighborhood design principles we have become so used to living among surroundings in which beauty has little or no place that we do not realize what a remarkable and unique feature the ugliness of modern life is both in this country and in may others wherever one finds a street or part of a street dating from before what we may call the modern period one is almost sure to see something pleasing and beautiful in its effect it is the lack of beauty of the amenities of life more than anything else which obliges us to admit that our work of town building in the past century has not been well done  town planning in practice raymond unwin 1909 a intent the intent of this to encourage the creation of viable neighborhoods that interconnect with each other and integrate new projects into the existing community thereby strengthening the original town the neighborhood layout should consider the street lot and block pattern of the original town as well as solar orientation topography sensitive wildlife and vegetation drainage patterns and environmental and regional climate issues further the edges of neighborhoods should be formed by features shared with adjacent neighborhoods such as major streets changes in street pattern greenways or natural features such as streams and major drainage or riparian corridors new streets bikeways sidewalks paths and trails should connect to existing adjacent neighborhoods b neighborhood structure following is a summary of essential elements to consider integrating into new neighborhoods 1 street sidewalk and trail connections within new neighborhoods that connect to adjacent existing neighborhoods and strengthen the connection to the existing town 2 streets that encourage pedestrian activity by creating an inviting atmosphere to the details of landscaping and tree locations sidewalks lighting and the building architecture etc 3 a mixeduse neighborhood center located for easy access 4 a variety of housing types sizes densities and price range that are well integrated 5 a variety of land uses that are wellintegrated and a transition of intensity nonresidential uses larger buildings and attached multifamily housing should be encouraged to be located near commercial centers with a transition to smaller buildings closer to lowdensity neighborhoods 6 pedestrian and bike connections throughout residential neighborhoods and linked to neighborhood commercial or civic centers and open space systems 7 parks open space public plaza and greens that are the focus of and wellintegrated into the neighborhood 8 street trees placed in new developments at regular intervals of forty 40 feet and placed directly adjacent to sidewalks see figure 219 at of this 9 architectural landscaping and site design elements of new developments as outlined in this c general provisions the following principles are contained in the original downtown of milliken a the comprehensive plan identifies them as contributing to the communitys smalltown character although the size of individual development proposals will vary projects will be evaluated with consideration to these neighborhood design principles and the context within which a project is located failure to incorporate these design principles into a project may be cause for denial of the project by the board of trustees 1 each neighborhood has a center and an edge it is important that every neighborhood have activity centers that draw people together use natural and manmade features such as a drainageway major roadways and ditches to define neighborhood edges buildings or other features located at gateways entering a neighborhood shall mark the transition into and out of the neighborhood in a distinct fashion using massing additional height contrasting materials andor architectural embellishments to obtain this effect 2 mix of types of dwelling units a mix of dwelling unit types shall be distributed throughout the development refer to division 6 of this additional housing requirements and of this illustrations of housing styles that the town is encouraging 3 focal points focal points or points of visual termination shall generally be occupied by more prominent monumental buildings and structures that employ enhanced height massing distinctive architectural treatments or other distinguishing features as well as landscape features see figure 21 figure 21 4 public space as development framework public space is used to organize blocks and circulation patterns and to enhance surrounding development public open space must be functional and easily accessible and shall be designed to organize the placement of buildings to create an identity for each neighborhood buildings should face public open space to allow for casual surveillance 5 design streets as public spaces a buildings shall define streets use of relatively uniform setbacks along each block the streetscape shall also be reinforced by lines of shade trees planted in the rightofway landscape strip and may be further reinforced by walls hedges landscaping or fences which define front yards refer to 162835 of this illustrations of streetscapes b on a lot with multiple buildings those located on the interior of the site shall relate to one another both functionally and visually a building complex may be organized around features such as courtyards greens or quadrangles which encourage pedestrian activity and incidental social interaction smaller individualized groupings of buildings are encouraged buildings shall be located to allow for adequate fire and emergency access 6 order rather than repetition the orderly arrangement of design elements can unify a space even when the elements are not the same the location of sidewalks relative to streets building setbacks and orientation and the placement of trees can all help create an overall impression of unity even though each home or building has a distinct character 7 use human proportion buildings shall be considered in terms of their relationship to the height and massing of adjacent buildings as well as in relation to the human scale in a small town this means generally onestory twostory and threestory buildings 8 define the transition between the public and private realm buildings shall be located to front towards and relate to public streets or parks both functionally and visually to the greatest extent possible wherever possible buildings shall not be oriented to front towards a parking lot 9 encourage walking and bicycling sites shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicles bicycles and pedestrians pedestrian and bicycle access and connections shall be designed to make it safe and easy to get around on foot and by bicycle 10 neighborhoods shall have a mix of activities available rather than a purely residential land use neighborhood residents shall have convenient access to parks schools open space trails and services the optimum size of a neighborhood is onequarter 14 mile from center to edge 11 fit within the environment rather than on top of it new developments shall be designed to respond to the natural environment fit into the setting and protect scenic view corridors key design considerations shall include a site layout that responds to natural features both on and offsite the size of structures and materials used in the development and the transition between the development and the surrounding landscape 12 encourage a range of residents in every neighborhood housing types and the size of lots shall be varied to enable people to remain in the neighborhood as their needs change refer to of this illustrations of architectural styles that the town is encouraging 13 housing types and styles that reflect the architecture of the region familiar architectural styles shall play an important role in developing an architectural identity for neighborhood dwellings new homes shall be designed consistent with the architectural principles outlined in division 6 of this 6 2003 blocks a intent the intent of the block and lot standards is to

emergency services personnel along the street frontage can readily view the correct address  division 2  street standards there is magic to great streets we are attracted to the best of them not because we have to go there but because we want to be there  great streets alan b jacobs intent the intent of the street standards is to establish a safe efficient attractive transportation system that promotes all modes of transportation and is sensitive to the environment in the recent past streets have been designed primarily to promote the efficient movement of traffic however streets have multiple functions as stated in performance streets bucks county 1980 it was often forgotten that residential streets become part of the neighborhood and are eventually used for a variety of purposes for which they were not designed residential streets provide direct auto access for the occupant to his home  they carry traffic past his home  they provide a visual setting and entryway for each house  a pedestrian circulation system  a meeting place for the residents  a play area whether one likes it or not for the children etc to design and engineer residential streets solely for the convenience of easy automobile movement overlooks the many overlapping uses of a residential street residential streets american society of civil engineers national association of home builders the urban land institute 1990 8 2003 general provisions the local street system of any proposed development shall be designed to be safe efficient convenient and attractive and consider the use by all

7  commercial and industrial architecture intent a the town has the following three 3 distinctly different commercialindustrial types of development within its planning area mixed use  businessindustrial  and businesscommercial they are different in character purpose and mixture of uses the design considerations vary for each type although there are many common design elements below outlines the common elements and the specific design considerations are identified by type b with respect to the mixed use millikens historic buildings have established a pattern of downtown development buildings are located close to the sidewalk forming a continuous street facade pedestrian movement is the primary focus building height architectural details front setbacks parking location wall articulation and sidewalks establish the architectural edge that defines this area as a walkable commercial corridor a mixed use commercial  downtown district has been created to strengthen the original downtown area c the businessindustrial is a primary employment center for the community this area is predominantly automobileaccessible  however one 1 of the design challenges is to improve the pedestrian connections internally and as this area connects to the rest of the community d finally businesscommercial is intended to be integrated into the design of new neighborhoods to serve as a focal point and meet convenience commercial needs 18 2003 general provisions a connections commercial developments must be linked with surrounding areas by extending town

shall require review and approval under the new requirements of this 4 2003 hsp hillsideridgeline protection overlay district a intent and purpose the intent and purpose of this overlay zone is to allow for lowintensity residential development that addresses concerns for public health and safety and promotes the design criteria set forth below all new development in this zone shall be sensitive to the hillside terrain and to the environmental constraints and shall provide for the conservation of existing natural open space lands unique landforms scenic hillsides and sensitive biological habitats these environmental constraints include potential danger from fire slope failure and erosion as well as the difficulty of emergency evacuation protection of the physical environment public views and aesthetic qualities associated with undeveloped lands is of critical concern in this zone lowintensity agricultural uses and passive recreational uses are also appropriate for this zone b design criteria 1 the area included in the hillside ridgeline protection zone encompasses a substantial amount of the towns undeveloped hillsides and ridgelines that overlook the thompson river valley not only does this land incorporate some of the most undisturbed physical environments in the town but it also supports many environmentally sensitive habitats these include ridgelines and unique landforms such as rock outcroppings and bluffs in addition land within this zone contains physical conditions such as steep topography and geologically sensitive areas that increase the environmental concerns of this zoning district 2 the following design criteria have been established to help ensure that future development proposals take the proper steps to avoid adverse impacts on these unique resources in addition all development proposals shall be subject to the zoning standards and design review procedures of this shall be strictly evaluated for conformance with the comprehensive plan and the johnstown milliken parks trails recreation and open space master plan the town may also require detailed environmental studies to identify specific impacts and the necessary mitigation measures all development proposals shall be subject to the following criteria a building site buildings and other improvements should be located on slopes of less than thirty percent 30% should be situated such that they do not adversely impact any mapped environmentally sensitive areas and should minimize impacts to ridgelines geologic hazard areas unique landforms and areas of high biological value b mass and scale the height and scale of the buildings should respect the natural surroundings and unique visual resources by incorporating designs that minimize bulk and mass follow natural topography and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscape structures shall be limited to onestory buildings c building size in addition to the mass and scale of the residence the total square footage shall also be maintained at a size compatible with the open space characteristics of the hillsides residential designs should blend in with the surroundings while minimizing their prominence to public view as such larger lots shall not necessarily enable the development of correspondingly larger homes d architectural style the architectural style including materials and colors should be compatible with the natural setting by encouraging designs that blend in with the surroundings natural materials such as stone and natural colors are required e grading development proposals should minimize grading of hillside areas by encouraging designs that follow the natural grade while maintaining a building mass and scale that is sensitive to topography f landscaping the proposal should maintain native vegetation to the greatest extent possible and should include the provision of additional native vegetation to mitigate potential visual impacts and erosion concerns associated with the development proposal g ridgelines no development shall be permitted which in any way alters an existing ridgeline including topographic changes visual obstruction or other direct impacts on the natural profile of the ridgeline if during the initial development review it is determined that a project could impact other ridgelines not identified in the general plan the appropriate mitigation measures shall be required to protect the physical and aesthetic character of the ridgeline such measures may include but are not limited to a restriction on ridgeline development and specific design modifications as may be required it is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate with a view analysis that the development will not adversely impact the ridgeline and will fit into the sites context and surroundings h setbacks for ridgeline development notwithstanding the dimensional standards for individual zoning districts all structures shall be set back a minimum distance of two hundred 200 feet from the edge of a ridgeline c uses permitted buildings structures and land shall be used and buildings and structures shall hereafter be erected designed structurally altered or

new art vii as set out herein the former art vii  16710167130 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from adopted in 2005  and adopted in 2012 purposeintentinterpretation a signs can obstruct views distract motorists displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation the regulations in this intended to coordinate the use placement physical dimensions and design of all signs within the town the purpose of these regulations is to 1 recognize that signs are a necessary means of visual communication for the convenience of the public and provide flexibility within the sign reviewapproval process to allow for unique circumstances and creativity 2 recognize and ensure the right of those concerned to identify businesses services and other activities by the use of signs and limit commercial signs to those which are accessory and incidental to the use on the premises where such signs are located 3 provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of commercial signs and similar devices 4 protect the public from damage or injury caused by signs that are poorly designed or maintained and from distractions or hazards to pedestrians or motorists caused by the indiscriminate placement or use of signs 5 ensure signs are well designed and contribute in a positive way to the towns visual environment express local character and help develop a distinctive image for the town 6 encourage signs that are responsive to the aesthetics and character of their particular location adjacent buildings and uses and the surrounding neighborhood and are compatible and integrated with the buildings architectural design and with other signs on the property 7 ensure signs are appropriate for the type of street on which they are located 8 sign shall not detract from the character of an architecturally significant or historic structure 9 bring nonconforming signs into compliance with these regulations when the use of the property changes or is discontinued when a new business license is issued or as a condition of approval of a land use action approved by the town such as a rezoning variance or other land use action 10 assist in wayfinding 11 regulate the size color illumination movement materials location height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation thus ensuring the protection of property values the character of the various neighborhoods the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development 12 promote efficient communication of messages 13 promote public welfare by reducing visual clutter 14 recognize that signs advertising discontinued commercial uses are misleading unnecessarily contribute to visual clutter and can unnecessarily obstruct views and distract motorists b this adequate communication while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design location size and purpose of all signs this be interpreted in a manner consistent with the first amendment guarantee of free speech c a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building therefore the intent of this to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in this d this not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the town rather it is intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one 1 or more of the purposes set forth above e this not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather it strikes an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs f this not intended to and does not apply to signs erected maintained or otherwise posted owned or leased by the state the federal government or the town the inclusion of government in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation but instead helps illustrate the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation g with respect to permitted hazard warning signs the board finds that the dispersed nature of utility oil and gas lines and other potential hazards throughout all the community does not lend itself to the property by property regulation otherwise used in this that warning of the location of utilities and of their hazards so that persons will not be injured thereby so that fire police and other public emergency services may be conducted all expeditiously and safely and so that the essential public functions served by such utilities will not be impaired
