provide appropriate penalties for improper work conduct 4to establish a period in which the employee is expected to have the problem corrected 5to provide a record of corrective action taken by the

superintendentsupervisory personnel in consultation with the mayors office may move more directly to a later step in the process including termination all action be it remedial or disciplinary should be taken within a reasonable time frame  it is strongly recommended that no more than three days 72 hours elapse between the time the superintendentsupervisory personnel hears or has knowledge of the offense and the action taken 1step one  oral warning oral warnings are appropriate for minor offenses it is important that superintendentssupervisory personnel not overuse the oral warning for the same type of offense no more than two oral warnings should be given to the same employee for the same offense athe superintendentsupervisory personnel should make it very clear to the employee that the oral warning is the first step in the progressive disciplinary process even though it is called an oral warning it is very important to document the warning the superintendentsupervisory personnel and the employee are required to sign the oral warning documentation oral warning documentation will permanently remain in the employees formal records in the clerktreasurers office 2step two  written

warnings permanently remain in the employees formal records in the clerk treasurers office 3step three  suspension suspension is the third step of the disciplinary procedure it is intended to indicate to the employee the seriousness of the infraction and that the employee can reasonably expect that the next step is termination of employment athe employee must be notified in writing of the suspension as soon as possible the letter should outline the reason for the suspension suspensions are normally three to seven consecutive work days longer suspensions may be given because of the seriousness of the infraction the employee should be warned that continuation of the behavior may result in termination of employment bnormally suspensions are without pay although if an investigation of events is necessary the employee may be suspended with pay pending results of the investigation 4step four  termination termination of employment is the culmination of the progressive discipline
