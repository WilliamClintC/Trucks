industrial subcategories these categorical standards established in separate regulations under 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405 to 471 are hereby incorporated into these regulations and shall be in addition to any pretreatment standards and requirements stated explicitly in this regulation the control authority may apply the following provisions where appropriate to modify the manner in which the categorical pretreatment standards are applied 1 categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of either mass or concentration of a pollutant in waste may be converted to equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with the provisions in 5 of this section 40 cfr c a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with this section  2496 reserved  2496  b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 2 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr e 3 variance from categorical pretreatment standards may be obtained in cases of fundamentally different factors regarding limits developed by epa if proven by the user in accordance with 40 cfr such variance may only be granted by the epa and the user must submit its request to epa 4 an industrial user may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following a categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of 4b of this section are met b criteria  either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters  credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere  2496 lancaster code  2496   credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section  credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the control authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority the control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions in 5a this section a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must  employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism   currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment   provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions   not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and  have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must  2496 reserved  2496   maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits   continue to record the facilitys flow rates using a continuous effluent flow monitoring device   continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in 5a of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the control authority must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to 5a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c a control authority which chooses to establish equivalent mass limits  must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor   upon notification of a revised production rate must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to  2497e of this chapter d the control authority may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as ph temperature radiation or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass 6 the control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and  2496 lancaster code  2496  455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the control authority g citys right of revision the city

cited as the the city of lancaster stormwater management swm   260102 statement of findings the lancaster city council finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of lancaster and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain cities to implement a program of stormwater controls these cities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes e riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in runoff providing light control and temperature moderation processing pollutants increasing infiltration and providing channel and shoreline stability thus decreasing erosion dep riparian forest buffer guidance  f much of the city is served by a combined sewer system that collects and transports both domestic sewage and rainwater that flows from impervious surfaces such as roofs streets and parking lots the citys advanced wastewater treatment facility is normally able to manage and clean the volume of wastewater flowing combined sewer system  however during intense rainstorms and other wet weather events the system becomes overwhelmed causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the conestoga river these events are referred to as combined sewer overflows  260101 skateboards  260103   260103 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare

 2611 title this chapter shall be known and cited as the city of lancaster pennsylvania stormwater management fee   2612 statement of findings a the city of lancaster owns operates and maintains stormwater management facilities  b inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety  c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge  stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality  d a comprehensive program of stormwater management is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the residents of the city of lancaster their resources and the environment in order to control items such as flooding erosion and pollution  e the collection and conveyance system for stormwater includes underground pipes but also includes conduits inlets culverts catch basins gutters ditches channels detention ponds streets curbs and drains  f the nature of stormwater is that any system to control stormwater must be designed for and funds must be expended to control peak flow total runoff volume and pollution in the stormwater   2601001 lancaster code  2612  g these three factors all relate to and are driven by impervious surface  once property is developed peak flow runoff volume and pollution all increase greatly  h peak flow occurs most often during periods of intense rainfall andor when the ground is saturated can accept no more water or is arid concretelike surface resulting from overly dry conditions  i because of the effect of weather on stormwater eg extended dry or wet periods no developed property can always accept all stormwater and all developed properties therefore generate stormwater runoff  j in a developed urban environment such as the city of lancaster each developed property generates runoff and therefore uses or is in some fashion connected with serviced by or benefited by the stormwater sewerage system which normally functions by collecting stormwater from a property andor by preventing stormwater from entering another property  k stormwater is heavily polluted when there has not been rain for a period of time and sediment yard waste animal waste pesticides herbicides oil and grease can be found in stormwater  l impervious surface is a primary indicator of the generation of stormwater and usage of the stormwater sewerage system  m the effects of stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems  n federal and state regulations require the city of lancaster to implement a program of stormwater controls  o on  the green infrastructure advisory committee presented a report to the city of lancaster on impervious area fee policy options and recommendations which summarized the citys stormwater program needs and policy options for funding those program needs p the city is facing numerous drivers requiring changes to the way it manages urban stormwater runoff all of which are addressed in the citys green infrastructure gi plan these drivers include increased regulatory requirements for managing the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff as well as maintenance requirements to ensure facilities are kept in working order with appropriate repair and replacement  q the report concluded that the city of lancaster formed a green infrastructure advisory committee to advise the city on options to manage stormwater and options to fund those stormwater management obligations   2612 skateboards  2612   2613 definitions r the green infrastructure advisory committee worked with city staff to define those program needs level of service and costs and evaluated alternative funding options that support the need for a dedicated funding source and recommended creation of an imperviousareabased fee referred to as the stormwater management fee that would be paid by all city properties in direct proportion to the amount of impervious area that is on their property using a system of tiers as presented in this chapter in addition the committee recommended that the city establish a system of credits to incentivize property owners to build and maintain stormwater management systems on their property  s the committees recommendations to charge a fee are based on a lengthy review and analysis of the real costs associated with the management and maintenance of the stormwater management system  t the fee recommended by the committee is intended to recoup such costs and is based upon the determination that the city of lancaster has no other means by which those costs can be recouped  u city council accepts and concurs with the recommendations and findings of the committee  and v city council is aware that it has been granted by the pennsylvania general assembly by and third class city the home rule charter and optional plans law and other legislation and of the courts of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the

terms and conditions a no extension of waterlines shall be permitted for a pipe having a diameter of less than six inches b the extendor shall cause such water main extension to be laid in accordance with city specifications and at all times subject to city inspection and approval and shall pay for the entire cost of such extension provided that if the city so elects it may require the extendor to make the extension of pipe having a larger diameter than the extendor requires for his own use if the city requires the extendor to lay a larger pipe than the extendor requires it shall pay the extendor the difference in the cost of the size pipe needed by the consumer and the size pipe prescribed by the city for such extension c any extendor shall satisfy the director of public works that he is financially able to pay for the cost of the proposed extension actual construction work for the same shall commence within 60 days of the date of the extension agreement between the city and the

grant the extendor additional time to start construction but such construction shall be started unless the entire project is assured of completion according to plan a the term of the lease shall be for a period of no more than 10 years from the time the line is placed in service b the city shall maintain and operate the line bearing all expense with relation thereto and serve water therefrom to the consumers and other parties connecting to the same c the extendor shall receive water from the city line and pay the city for the same at the published rates of the city for such service which may be in effect from time to time during such service the consumer shall be bound by all rules and regulations of the city relating to water service d during the term of such lease while ownership of the line remains in the extendor no other person shall be allowed to connect to such line unless such person pays the extendor a connection fee in accordance with the following schedules which shall apply for single service connection to a single property  29582 lancaster code  29583  1 the following connection fee rates shall apply when the extension was performed by municipalities commercial enterprises and developers service connection size inches fee 34 $100 1 $150 1 14 $200 1 12 $300 2 $500 4 $2000 2 this connection fee shall be applicable where a threefourthsinch or oneinch connection is made to an extension that was performed as a noncommercial nondevelopmental extension by owners or occupants of residential properties acting either individually or in combination for the purpose of extending waterlines to their properties for their personal use in such cases the connection fee for each new connection shall be a sum computed by multiplying the total cost of the water main less any extension fees paid from time to time pursuant to hereof by a fraction the numerator of which shall be one and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of properties single service connected to the water main as of the date of the new connection plus one representing the new property to be connected 3 example a assume six property owners combined to extend a water main at a cost of $1000 further assume that a total of 10 properties are located along the line but that four of them did not elect to participate in construction of the line the connection fee that would be charged in the event that any of the four properties would later elect to connect to the water main would be computed as follows  29583 vehicles for hire  29583  connection fee   total cost of water main x 1 number of properties single service connected + 1 for the new property $14285   $100000 x 1 6 + 1 b based upon the above example the seventh property to connect would pay an extension fee of $14285 which would be paid to the original six extenders $2380 each and would reduce their original cost from $16666 each or 16 of $1000 to $14285 or the same as the seventh connector when the eighth property connected its cost would be $125 or 18 of $1000 with the connection fee being returned to the original six extenders and so on ninth and tenth connectors e in the case of another extendor who wishes to connect to such water main for the purpose of laying his own main to serve a number of prospective consumers therefrom such extendor shall pay the owner lessor an amount which represents no more than 50% of the cost of such water main up to the point of such connection after deducting from such cost any connection fees already paid for connections to the waterline up to the point of connection such other extendor shall not be entitled to receive any connection fees for connections made to the original line but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the line which he himself pays for in accordance with a lease similar to that provided for herein f at no time shall the extendor be entitled to recover more than the total cost of the waterline calculated without interest if such total cost has been recovered prior to 10 years from the date when the line was placed in service the lease shall terminate at the time of the recovery of such cost if the total cost has not been recovered within 10 years from the date when the line was placed in service it shall terminate in all events at the end of the tenyear period and the right of the extendor to recover any more costs shall cease g the city shall charge an extendor or single service connector a service fee of 5% of the extension or connection fee but not more than $100 which shall be paid by the extendor or connector in addition to the fee  29583 lancaster code  29583   29584 city extensions the city shall have the right at all times to make connections to the lines of the extendor and lay additional water mains at its own cost without the payment of any connection fee to the extendor provided that such extensions and additions so made by the city are solely for the improvement of its water service and no consumers are connected thereto if any consumer connections are made to any such additions made by the city then such lines shall be subject to the terms of the lease as if made by a private extendor  29585 city contribution to cost in the event that the city makes a contribution towards the cost of laying the waterline representing the difference in cost of the size of pipe as contemplated in  29582b then such contribution shall be deemed to represent as many linear feet of waterline as the linear foot cost of the entire line and the city authority shall own the initial number of linear feet thus represented so that the line owned by the extendor and leased to the city shall be deemed to start at the point where the initial number of linear feet ends example a twelveinch waterline for 5000 linear feet costs $50000 or $10 per linear foot the city contributes $15000 for the difference in cost between sixinch pipe and twelveinch pipe the city authority would own the initial 1500 feet of twelveinch waterline and the remaining 3500 feet would be owned by the extendor and leased to the city as herein provided  29586 extension decisions the final decision on whether or not an extension to the waterlines shall be permitted on the conditions outlined herein or otherwise shall be and remain with the city the city authority which shall become the ultimate owner of waterlines extended as herein provided shall be notified of each lease agreement relating thereto and receive a copy thereof due to compensate the city for services performed related to the connection or extension h upon termination of the lease the extendor shall dedicate the waterline to the city authority and it shall thereupon become a part of the water distribution system  29583
