involving excavation or filling or a combination of excavation and filling affecting 800 cubic yards or more of dirt sand or other excavation or fill material 5 those involving street highway road or bridge construction enlargement relocation or reconstruction 6 those involving the laying repairing replacing or enlarging of an underground pipe or facility for a distance of 600 feet or more 7 those involving grading removal of protective ground cover or vegetation excavation demolition land filling or other land disturbing activity on slopes of 10% or more note utility companies responsible for energy repair work should enter into a memorandum of agreement with the village staff clearly stating their responsibilities if their activities may be included under any of the above applicability criteria b erosion and other pollutant control requirements the following requirements shall be met on all sites described in 1 site dewatering water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins grit chambers sand filters upslope chambers hydrocyclones swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate if the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than 100 microns during dewatering operations then no control is needed before discharge except as determined by the village staff water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels  28542 fox point code  28542  note there are several ways to meet this particle size performance objective depending on the pumping rate as an example if the pumping rate is very low one gallon per minute then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe about eight inches in diameter for one gallon per minute several feet long would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of 100 micron and larger particles as the pumping rate increases then the device must be enlarged at a moderate 100 gallons per minute pumping rate a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe or concrete pipe section or other small tank about 4 12 feet across for a 100 gallons per minute pumping rate several feet tall would be adequate with these pipe sections or small tanks inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence with very large pumping rates 10000 gallons per minute sediment basins about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10000 gallons per minute at least three feet in depth with a simple but adequately sized pipe outlet would be needed more sophisticated control devices such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above but they would not be required 2 waste and material disposal all waste and unused building materials including garbage debris cleaning wastes wastewater toxic materials or hazardous materials shall be properly disposed of and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system 3 tracking each site shall have graveled roads access drives and parking areas constructed as set forth in the bmp handbook to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways these areas shall be inspected and maintained each workday 4 drain inlet protection all storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale filter fabric or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria standards and specifications 5 sediment cleanup all offsite sediment deposits occurring as a result of a storm event shall be cleaned up by the end of the next workday all other offsite sediment deposits occurring as a result of construction activities shall be cleaned up by the end of that same workday clean up shall be done by means of a pickup type sweeper  flushing is not allowed 6 site erosion control the following criteria apply only to land development or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site a channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing site shall be diverted around disturbed areas if practical  28542 general provisions  28542  otherwise the channel shall be protected as described below in 6c sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have

conveyance and receiving channels b all activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time c runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either of the following  all disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more days shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding only available prior to september 15 or by mulching or covering or other equivalent best management practice  for sites with more than 10 acres disturbed at one time or if a channel originates in the disturbed area one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least 1% of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet the basin shall be designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size based on the set of oneyear design storms having durations from 05 to 24 hours the basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water  for sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time filter fences straw bales sediment traps or equivalent best management practices shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site if a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes site filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel d any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than 10 cubic yards of material should not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel if remaining for more than seven days they shall be
