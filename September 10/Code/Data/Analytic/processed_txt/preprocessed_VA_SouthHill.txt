districts are listed above for completeness each special district has its own special requirements and for this reason regulations for these districts are set out in separate articles of this chapter all uses that are permitted within the town are listed alphabetically in the first column of this table each column after that represents one primary zoning district and each row represents one specific use within the columns various codes identify the zoning districts in which each use is permitted a use is shown in one of the following ways to be permitted by right  or to be permitted as a special exception use according to the following 1 use permitted by right this type of use is one that is permitted in a zoning district and for which a permit may be approved by the zoning administrator after an applicant meets the requirements of the district regulations in which the use is to be located and other applicable town codes and ordinances the abbreviation used in the table to indicate a use permitted by right is the letter r when that abbreviation is used in the table it indicates that the corresponding use is permitted by right in the district or districts indicated at the top of the column 2 use permitted by special exception permit this type of use is one that while permitted in a district each specific occurrence must be approved as a legislative action by the town council after review by the planning commission with the same notices and hearings that are required for zoning changes the abbreviation used to indicate a conditional use in the table is the letter s 3 interpretation of table 41 a if a use is not specifically listed in the table then that use may not be established within the town b a use may however be implied listing of a category which contains a family of uses although the use itself may not be specifically listed as a separate use in such case the use may be permitted in a district only if it can be clearly demonstrated that the use is customarily accepted as being within the meaning of the category identified in the table c if however a specific use is listed in the table as permitted in any district by right or by special exception then that use may not be implied as belonging to a general category in such case a specific use definition shall take precedence over a general category definition d regulations of an overlay zoning district which place limitations on or modifies the requirements of a use or uses otherwise permitted in a primary zoning district shall be considered to be in addition to the regulations of the primary zoning district in which such use or uses are located e special exception uses that require authorization by the town council are listed in table 41 the following conditions apply to all special exception uses 1 the use shall comply with all licensing requirements if any of any town county state or federal government or their agencies 2 the use shall be operated in a way as to be compatible with other uses within the same vicinity and in no manner shall it become a nuisance to the neighborhood in which it is located 3 in granting a special exception use the town council shall consider the public convenience necessity and general welfare 4 a special exception use permit shall be approved only when town council is satisfied that the use and the operation thereof will not be in conflict with the objectives of the comprehensive plan will not adversely affect adjoining and surrounding property will not unreasonably impair light and air convenience of

encroach upon historic areas and will not otherwise be contrary to the stated intent and purpose of this chapter or contrary to good zoning practices 5 in evaluating and acting upon special exception use permit applications the planning commission and the town council shall consider among other factors the adequacy of utilities access and necessary public facilities and services  offstreet parking and vehicular circulation  the arrangement and relationship among elements of the site plan  and the adequacy of separation buffers yards and other features to protect adjacent properties from potential adverse effects of the conditional use the planning commission may recommend and the town council may impose such reasonable requirements and conditions as deemed necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of this chapter and to meet the guidelines set forth in this section 6 except to the extent that greater requirements may be imposed by the town council pursuant to the provisions of this section a special exception use shall comply with the regulations and standards generally applicable within the district in which it is located and with any specific conditions for the particular use as set forth in the district regulations 7 it is the intent of this chapter that if required and upon application by the owner a special exception permit shall be automatically issued administratively and without payment of any fees for any legally existing special exception use that was properly authorized by a previous zoning ordinance prior to the date of adoption of this chapter  accessory uses accessory uses that are customarily associated with and are essential to the use and operation of a primary use are considered as part of the primary use and unless otherwise
