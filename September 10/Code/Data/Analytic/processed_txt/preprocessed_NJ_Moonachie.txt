application of fertilizer so as to reduce the overall amount of excess nutrients entering waterways thereby helping to protect and improve surface water quality this section does not apply to fertilizer application on commercial farms  13232 basics and background #201110 elevated levels of nutrients particularly phosphorus in surface water bodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants eutrophication excessive plant growth can result in diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and ph which in turn can be detrimental to aquatic life as algae and plant materials die off the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels the presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected water for recreation and water supply while healthy vegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing soil and filtering precipitation when fertilizers are applied to the land surface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation nutrients can be transported by means of stormwater to nearby waterways contributing to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation most soils in new jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorus to support adequate root growth for established turf over time it is necessary to replenish available phosphorus but generally not at the levels commonly applied other target vegetation such as vegetable gardens and agriculturalhorticultural plantings will have a greater need for phosphorus application as will the repair or establishment of new lawns or cover vegetation a soils test and fertilizer application recommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best means to determine the amount of nutrients to apply timing and placement of fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrients to waterways runoff fertilizer applied immediately prior to a runoffproducing rainfall outside the growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of supporting target vegetation growth therefore the management of the type amount and techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources this section does not apply to application of fertilizer on commercial farms but improper application of fertilizer on forms would be problematic as well stewardship on the  13225 moonachie code  13232  part of commercial farmers is needed to address this potential source of excess nutrient load to water bodies commercial farmers are expected to implement best management practices in accordance with conservation management plans or resources conservation plans developed for the
