regulation nine  streets and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the

limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation 2sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area 3each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the citys rationale for this chapter exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses additionally the citys interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city the city

authorizes a ciu to obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the ciu can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr 40313 that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by epa when developing the categorical pretreatment standard if the user has obtained an fdf variance from epa on the basis of 40 cfr 40313 the potw is authorized to recognize the revised standards 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the public works director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with b5 and 6 see 40 cfr 4036c 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the public works director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users see 40 cfr 4036c2 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the public works director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 4 a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this cfr 40315 a categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of b4b are met b criteria 1either athe applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or b the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2 credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3 credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the public works director the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in b5a1  5 below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the long term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ban industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flowmonitoring device  2 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the public works director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in b5a3 upon notification of a revised production rate the public works director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to b5a1 so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit cwhen developing equivalent mass limits the public works director 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process es of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to f the industrial user must also be in compliance with a4 regarding the prohibition of bypass 6the public works director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the public works director when converting such limits to concentration limits the public works director will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by f see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the public works director will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 7 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this b in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived see 40 cfr 4036c7 8 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation see 40 cfr 4036c8 9 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the public works director within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the public works director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate see 40 cfr 4036c9 c state

consistent with the purpose of this chapter fdilution no user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement the public works director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate passed 21109 91309 pretreatment of

personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation 2entertainment establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area

115102general 115103basis of determination 115104specific regulations pertaining to conditionally permissible uses 115105conditionally permitted uses 115101 purpose the regulation of all uses of land and structures has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use districts however the functions and characteristics of an increasing number of new kinds of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of the older familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community it should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the nature magnitude and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied depending upon functional characteristics competitive situations and the availability of land rather than assign all uses to special individual and limited zoning districts it is important to provide controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for the investor but that will at the same time maintain adequate provisions for the security of the health safety convenience and general welfare of the communitys inhabitants in order to accomplish such a dual objective provision is made in this a more detailed consideration of each of the certain specific activities as it may relate to proposed conditions of location design size operation intensity of use generation of population processes and equipment employed amount and kind of public facilities and services required together with many other possible factors land and structures possessing these particularly unique characteristics relative to their location in certain districts are designated as

an inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance with the exception of a sedimentsettling pond it must be repaired or maintained within three 3 days of the inspection sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten 10 days of the inspection bwhen practices fail to provide their intended function if an inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended function as detailed in the swp3 and that another more appropriate control practice is required the swp3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed within ten 10 days of the inspection cwhen practices depicted on the swp3 are not installed if an inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in accordance with the schedule the control practice must be implemented within ten 10 days from the date of the inspection if the internal inspection reveals that the planned control practice is not needed the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed 10final stabilization all soil disturbing activities are complete and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70
