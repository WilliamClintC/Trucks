3138 purposes and objectives the purpose of this is to establish standards rules and regulations with respect to the use of the potw to provide for rates and charges for connection to and use of the system to establish limits for the discharge of pollutants into the system and to prevent the pollution of the environment a that there is a need to assure the quality of the wastewater discharged by the publicly owned treatment works potw to prevent the degradation of the grand river  b that there is a need to protect the biological systems operation and infrastructure regulation of discharge into the potw  c that there is a need for the city to enhance its ability to regulate the discharge of wastewater to the potw consistent with local state and federal laws a this sets forth requirements for dischargers into the grand rapids wastewater collection and treatment systems and enables the grand rapids system to protect the public health and environment in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws relating thereto b the objectives of this are 1 to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw which interfere with the normal operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge 2 to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw which do not receive adequate treatment in the potw and which will pass system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system 3 to improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system c this provides for the issuance of permits and

includes the right to use the public rightofway to provide such service but does not contain rightofway management and related provisions b the municipalitys cable television consent agreement with its current cable operator predates the uniform video services local franchise act and has rightofway management and related provisions however that act states that as of  any provisions of such an agreement that are inconsistent with or in addition to the standardized uniform form of franchise agreement established by the mpsc are unreasonable and unenforceable by the franchising entity c telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized uniform form of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from the municipality a permit under the metro act84 to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway such metro act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such rightofway usage standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the mpsc and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the mpsc d because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities such metro act permits generally provide adequate public rightofwayrelated protections for a municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services e other video service providers in particular new providers or existing cable operators may not have a metro act permit issued by a municipality f the uniform video services local franchise act and the standardized uniform franchise agreement require video service providers with such an agreement to
