caused considerable property damage personal injury and even death to those participating in the manufacturing process and to innocent bystanders 2 5x refined butane is used to dissolve the tetrahydrocannabinol thc resin which concentrates into a liquidoil form as a result of the butanes stripping process the stripping of the thc use of refined butane causes flammable butane vapors to

source if 5x refined butane and higher is used 3 a honey oil lab using 5x refined butane and higher presents a serious hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by a combustible gas instrument such conditions present grave risk of loss where devices such as a taser are capable of igniting the gas resulting in an explosion 4 the resale of 5x refined butane occurs

procedure  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of willows does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of willows are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or floodrelated erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 4 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  52609     definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have

permit requirements of wmc 3 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection 4a of this section 6 floodways since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of willows b within an adopted regulatory floodway the city of willows shall prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge c if subsections 6a and b of this section are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section  52609         variance procedure 1 nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of willows to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 2 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of wmc  and  have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in wmc  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of willows city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that i the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and ii such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of glenn county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency 3 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the i danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  ii danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  iii susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  iv importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  v necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  vi availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  vii compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  viii relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  ix safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  x expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and xi costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a i showing of good and sufficient cause  ii determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see definition of public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections 3a d of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of subsection 3a of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  52609    california administrative code adopted  adopted the 2016 california administrative title
