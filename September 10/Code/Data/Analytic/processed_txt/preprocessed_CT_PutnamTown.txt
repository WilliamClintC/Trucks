follows  2112 findings the flood hazard areas of the town of putnam are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard area by uses vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  town of putnam ct  81167 a b c d e a b c d e f g  2113 purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which may increase flood hazards to other lands  2114 objectives the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health  to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects  to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  to minimize prolonged business interruptions  to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and to ensure that potential
