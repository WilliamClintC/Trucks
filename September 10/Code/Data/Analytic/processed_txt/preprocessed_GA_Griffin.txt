stormwater management action plan jointly prepared by ogden environment and energy services and water resources inc properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with other water resource management programs 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 4 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and risk exposure 5 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs 6 the board of commissioners finds concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city 7 an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs including but not limited to allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects a service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems andor actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits in addition the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors including but not limited to the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system 22135 12141999 establishment of a utility and enterprise fund a there is hereby established a stormwater management utility within the city which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the citys corporate limits and shall provide for the management protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater

city budget and accounting system separate and apart from its general fund for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility including but not limited to rentals rates charges fees and licenses as may be established by the board of commissioners all revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility including capital project construction no other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues except that other revenues receipts and resources not accounted for in

backflow prevention 1 water distribution systems are designed with the intention of the water flowing in a certain direction from the distribution system to the customer however hydraulic conditions within the system may deviate from the normal conditions causing the water to flow in the opposite direction therefore it is possible and common for the water to flow in the opposite direction in an unprotected system this is called backflow 2 backflow occurs when the pressure in the distribution system drops siphoning water from the customers system into the distribution system this would also siphon any substance which may be in contact with the water system crossconnection this type of backflow is called backsiphonage and may occur when there is an unusually high use of water or undersized piping in an area for example during fire fighting or when a main water line breaks water is sucked to the point of high usage possibly drawing nonpotable substances with it filling the water line with these substances backsiphonage may occur connection such as a hose from a maintenance sink in a mop bucket or a belowtherim water inlet to a tank containing a toxic solution 3 some water customers have nonpotable materials on the premises under pressure when an unprotected water line is attached to the container or pipes holding the pressurized material the material may be pumped back into the potable water system this type of backflow is called backpressure backpressure may occur crossconnection such as a makeup water line which is connected to a recirculating system containing soap acid antifreeze or any other nonpotable substance 4 because of these potential dangers to the water consumer it is necessary to control crossconnections there are several types of mechanical assemblies which serve as backflow preventers different types of backflow preventers are designed to work under backsiphonage or backpressure conditions some are acceptable for lowhazard or nonhealth hazard conditions 5 this article regulates the proper use of backflow prevention devices and assemblies b responsibility 1 the director of the water and wastewater department has the primary responsibility for protecting the public water system against backflow and backsiphonage this responsibility begins at the water supply source includes all of the public water distribution system and generally ends at the point of water delivery to the customers premises or system the city water and wastewater department is not responsible for abatement of crossconnections within a customers premises but rather undertakes reasonable precautions to protect the public water system from backflow crossconnections taking reasonable precautions includes ensuring that proper backflow preventers are installed and maintained by the customer at its sole expense at the point of service connection 2 the installation of a backflow preventer at a service connection in accordance with this section may not negate the need for additional backflow preventers at points of water use within the customers potable water system 3 authority is hereby delegated to the director to promulgate and adopt a manual setting forth a crossconnection control program for the elimination and prevention of all crossconnections in accordance with this article such program shall conform to the standards of the american water works association manual 14 and the us environmental protection agency crossconnection manual said manual shall be submitted to the georgia environmental protection division of the

overlay district 723 a  background open space development has numerous environmental and community benefits including 1 reduces the impervious cover in a development impervious cover contributes to degradation of water resources by increasing the volume of surface runoff and preventing infiltration of rainfall into the soil surface 2 reduces pollutant loads to streams and other water resources 3 reduces potential pressure to encroach on resource buffer areas 4 reduces soil erosion potential by reducing the amount of clearing and grading on the site 5 preserves green space 6 preserves open space for recreation 7 reduces the capital cost of development 8 reduces the cost of stormwater management by concentrating runoff in one area and reducing runoff volumes 9 provides a wider range of feasible sites to locate stormwater bmps 10 reduces the cost of future public services needed by the development 11 can increase future property values 12 creates urban wildlife habitat islands 13 creates a sense of community and pedestrian movement 14 can support other community planning goals such as farmland preservation affordable housing and architectural diversity 723 b  purposes the purpose this zoning district is to protect natural historic and community resources within the city of griffin by promoting open space development within our jurisdictions it also aims to serve as a tool for water quality and watershed protection and to enhance the visual and esthetic value of land in the city of griffin by providing for and promoting the development of residential subdivisions that conserve open space and integrate natural features into site design specifically the district intends 1 to provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure 2 to provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land 3 to preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater floodplains wetlands streams steep slopes woodlands and wildlife habitat 4 to permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development 5 to reduce erosion and

a the city of griffin finds that signs are a proper use of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises 1201 b regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens to the extent regulation of signs affects speech protected by the first amendment to the us constitution and art 1 par 5 of the 1983 constitution of georgia the regulation should be contentneutral on its face  otherwise the need to regulate must be justified by a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored to be the least intrusive imposition on free speech 1201 c the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected on public rightsofway for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type

of griffin development standards 1304  process details and characteristics 1304 a  project review committee the project review committee concept as stated above is an integral part of the onestop method of site and subdivision plan review the committee concept is designed to provide an applicant with clear consistent concise and timely plan reviews in addition the committee provides a continuity of reviewer via the utilization of a case manager to insure that issues are resolved at their proper level and time in the process and are not revisited once resolved 1 membership and composition the case manager shall be the director of the department of development services or their designee he or she will remain continually involved with the project throughout the entire development process until all relevant land development permits have been issued other committee members shall consist of a representative from a the department of public works  b the department of development services  c the department of stormwater  d the department of waterwastewater  e the department of solid waste  and f consultant engineer other departments and agencies traditionally involved in the review process will function on an asneeded basis 2 committee meetings the committee meets at designated critical points throughout the site development plan review process these meetings are kept to a minimum in order to save staff time 3 responsibilities of the committee members a the case manager shall coordinate the overall review and processing of an application and ensure that department comments do not conflict b the department of public works is responsible for the engineering review of the street aspects of the plan this includes a review for conformity with this ordinances technical standards other city and state technical regulations and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards c the department of stormwater is responsible for the stormwater aspects of the plan this includes a review for conformity with this ordinances technical standards stormwater design ordinance and other city and state technical regulations and other

and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards 1304 b  required plan types 1 preliminary site plans these initial plan types are required for all projects resulting in the creation of three or more lots or any new development involving 11 acres or more preliminary plans are meant to show the general design of a site development or subdivision project and its public improvements so the city can indicate its approval or disapproval of the project prior to the time the final plans and plats are designed the city shall review the practicability of the preliminary plan and its general design attention shall be given to the arrangement location and width of streets and travelways arrangement placement and size of structures their general relationship to the topography of the land feasibility of water supply and sewage disposal general handling of site drainage lot sizes and arrangement the future development of adjoining lands as yet undeveloped the relationship of adjoining developed lands and the requirementsguidelines of the comprehensive plan zoning ordinance and this ordinance preliminary plans are not meant to either depict or be reviewed for final engineering design and details 2 minor site plans this plan type may be submitted when the proposed improvements are being requested to a site of less than 11 acres on which the city either has not previously approved a final site plan or on which there is an existing approved plan that has been closed built in addition the proposed improvements must be minor in nature and generally 1 not change either the internal or external traffic flow patterns  2 not increase the number of dwelling units  3 not increase the nonresidential building size by more than 2500 square feet or 75 percent of the gross building area whichever is less  and 4 generally the proposed disturbed area should not exceed 5000 square feet the applicant must provide the department of stormwater an impervious site change form noting the limits of additional impervious area on the site 3 final site and subdivision plans construction drawings these plan types and any necessary supporting documents for a proposed project constitute the complete application for construction approval they shall include complete and detailed engineering and layout drawings for all the public and private improvements and utilities in addition to any necessary ancillary calculations required for review upon approval the final plans and plats form the basis for the construction of the project and the inspection services of the

depend on its design characteristics 1304 c  development plan review 1 once a complete application for a development plan has been submitted to the department of development services and the appropriate fees paid copies will be transmitted to a number of government agencies for their review and comment some of these reviews are necessary to meet city objectives other reviews are done to accommodate the applicant and expedite the process of development with state agencies 2 review of the aspects of the development plans beyond the auspices of internal city agencies are circulated by the department of development services to appropriate agencies such as the georgia department of transportation gdot spalding county planning department for plans on lots that abut the citycounty boundary line and the usda soil conservation service for review 3 the basic review of a site development plan and subdivision plan is an analysis of the physical layout including the dimensions the topography the natural features of the site proper erosion and sediment control provisions and a determination of the use proposed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 4 although the erosion and sedimentation control plan review is performed separately from the site development plan review the city administers this review jointly with the site development plan review and site inspections 5 all comments made by the review agencies must be satisfactorily addressed before the department of development services approves the plan all approvals or denials shall be made in writing stating the specific reasons therefore the department of development services approval in no way affects the authority of external agencies to issue their own permits for any aspect of the
