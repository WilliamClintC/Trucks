now standard for economic development includes a growing recognition of the need for neighborhood and community parks  comprehensive recreational facilities  trail connectivity of parks schools and recreation facilities  including sufficient open space areas for both passive and active function this recognition has developed not only because of the important aesthetic reasons involved but also because of the increased realization that these parks recreational facilities and open space areas are a vital ingredient in any urban world that is to be considered livable bif there is to be a quality environment throughout the community and if likewise there are to be adequate parks and recreational facilities for all citizens and a variety of leisure time opportunities for the entire family then it is going to be necessary that a city have a comprehensive park system a comprehensive park system by setting forth definite principles policies practices and priorities will meet the needs of and serve the citizens by providing recreational outlets and sources of relaxation and also by improving the visual quality of the urban environment  thus making the community a much more enjoyable and attractive place in which to live based upon national standards by the national parks & recreation association npra governing body it is hereby found and determined by the city as established by the division of parks & recreation master plan that the public health safety and welfare requires that at least ten 10 acres of land for each 1000 persons residing within the city of fairborn be devoted to neighborhood and community park recreational facilities andor trails  and the same is hereby established as the parkland standard for all purposes of this section it is the goal of the city of fairborn to provide such a comprehensive park system ca comprehensive park and trail system is a necessary and integral part of any community and as such it will be found that parks trails and open space areas are a key element in and a dominant feature of the social and physical structure of the community the importance and value of such public improvements as streets and sidewalks water distribution systems sanitary sewer systems storm sewer systems street lighting street name and traffic control signs and other such required public improvements and physical facilities has long been recognized and acknowledged community development directors and planners have developed a realization that adequate parks trails proper recreational facilities and sufficient open space areas represent a need as real and important as that for these other required public improvements parks trails recreational facilities and open space areas are no longer merely desirable they have in effect become a modern necessity especially as relates to the continued growth development and expansion of the city dbecause of this increased awareness of the need for and necessity of parks trails recreational facilities and open space areas in the community the demands upon the city to reserve acquire develop and maintain adequate parks trails and open space areas are going to increase this is especially going to be the case in newly developed areas where because of the massing together of large residential sections the demand for urban services and recreational areas and facilities is going to be localized eif these parks trails and recreational facilities are to be provided then adequate land must be available this will certainly require an effective park land acquisition and development program obviously public finances are currently totally inadequate to accomplish this task furthermore in light of the existing fiscal situation in our community it has been determined that the city must prevent an excessive burden on property taxes and particularly as relates to existing residents consequently the responsibility for providing these needed parks trails recreational facilities and open space areas is going to have to be assumed by those citizens directly benefitting from their use fthe purpose of this chapter is to set forth a workable procedure whereby adequate parks trails open space areas and recreational facilities may be mandatorily required in newly developed areas on an equitable and reasonable basis and financed by those directly benefitting from these parks and facilities only in this manner and with such requirements will the city be able to assure that parks open space areas and recreational facilities are provided in newly developed areas and thus in the process prevent a further widening of the gap between the need for such parks and recreational facilities and their availability gall land dedications andor

of the community are as follows asubdivider every subdivider who subdivides and plats land shall dedicate a portion of such land pay a fee inlieu thereof or provide a combination of both such conditions to be satisfied before a final plat map will be approved and recorded however for the purposes of this chapter where the required park land dedication would be less than one 1 acre then

enactment of this chapter has previously been subdivided and platted and which has not since the enactment of this chapter been redivided ie lot splits shall dedicate a portion of such land prior to the issuance of any building permits for the development pay a fee inlieu thereof or provide a combination of both however for purposes of this chapter where the required park land dedication would be

combination of both in the event that the land has previously been subdivided and the noted conditions as outlined in subsection a above have already been satisfied then the land dedication and fee payment requirement would be based only upon the additional lot or lots created by the lot split and the resultant increase in the population density for purposes of this chapter where the required

urban planners and available to cities today including and among others the linear corridor parks system the large scale parks system the small scale parks system and the combination parks system it has been determined and established that the combination parks system is best suited for and best meets the open space and recreational needs of this community such a combination parks system emphasizes the integration of parks of varying sizes and functions throughout the community and encompasses possibly one very large city park several strategically located multipleuse community parks and many smaller and evenly dispersed neighborhood parks and block parks bto fully provide for the open space and recreational needs of the community a comprehensive parks and recreation system is required as indicated above such a system will include a combination of open space and recreational areas involving a variety of park types each serving a particular area and range of active and
