the owner independent of the semiannual test by the water supplier and said test must be conducted by a certified tester d any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test must be repaired or replaced by a licensed plumber when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owners expense to insure proper operation high hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than 14 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service remains during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity e backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified above in in cases where there is a history of test failures and the commission feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted cost of the additional tests will be born by the owner f records the commission will initiate and maintain the following 1 master files on customer crossconnection tests andor inspections 2 master files on approved crossconnection installations copies of lists and summaries supplied to the massachusetts department of environmental protection 3 a reports the commission will submit the following to dep 1 initial listing of high hazard crossconnections 2 initial listing of low hazard crossconnections 3 annual updated lists of the items in 1 and 2 above 4 annual summary of crossconnection inspections and surveys b  40424 barre code  40426   40426 addendum residential dual check effective the date of the acceptance of the crossconnection control program for the town of barre massachusetts all new residential buildings on the public water supply will be required to install a residential dual check device immediately downstream of the water meter this device will be provided by the water commission at a scheduled cost to the homeowner installation of this residential dual check device on a retrofit basis on existing service lines will be instituted at a time and at a potential cost to the homeowner as deemed necessary by the commission 1 the owner must be aware that installation of a residential dual check valve results in a potential closed plumbing system within his residence as such provisions may have to be made by the owner to provide for thermal expansion within his closed loop system ie the installation of thermal expansion devices andor pressure relief valves 2 a strainers the commission strongly recommends that all new and retrofit installations of reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed with the benefit of strainers b right to establish further regulations the water commission reserves the right to establish such further regulations from time to time as it may deem expedient for the introduction and use of the water c  40426 alarm systems  40426  council on aging bylaws  4051 establishment  statutory authority the name of the organization shall be the barre council on aging
