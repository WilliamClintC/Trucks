of the public in obtaining such access cfindings re index 1rcw 1 requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of various public records rcw 4 provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome 2the city of raymond is comprised of many departments which maintain separate databases andor record keeping systems the city produces or receives many records each day the records are diverse complex and stored in multiple locations and multiple computer systems and databases it would be extremely difficult unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations to compile and maintain a central index of records 3the development and maintenance of a city index would be extremely costly and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense in maintaining the index the citys operations do not allow for the addition revision or reassignment of duties of existing personnel so that an index may be developed and maintained anticipated city revenues do not allow for additional staff for the purpose of creating and maintaining such an index   public records index order pursuant to rcw 4 the city council orders the following athe city of raymond is not required to maintain a current index of public records due to findings of the city council that the requirement to do so is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations

requests in the order allowing the most requests to be processed in the most efficient manner in an effort to better understand the request and provide all responsive records the pro can inquire about

identify the requested records such clarification may be requested and provided by telephone if the clarification is made by telephone the pro will confirm the scope of the clarification in writing

production in whole or in part if a record is exempt from production and subject to denial the pro will state the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of the denial and how the exemption applies to the record being withheld this explanation should be sufficient to enable the requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption and denial are proper if only a portion of a record is exempt from production but the remainder is not exempt the pro will redact the exempt portions produce the nonexempt portions and indicate to the requestor why portions of the record are being redacted for the purposes of these rules redact means the exempt information will be covered in some manner and then the record will be photocopied and the photocopy then disclosed

request when the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for the requested copies the pro will

ordinances evariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or the economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare fvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection a of this section and otherwise complies with rmc a

regard to the procedures set forth in this section hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor

administrator may approve a reduction in the required buffer widths if the reduction does not result in a net loss of ecological function the administrator may alter or reduce the required buffer width under the following conditions 1a buffer may be reduced to the waterward edge of an improved public rightofway rail grade or flood control structure that physically separates a buffer into one or more sections and disconnects hydraulic continuity to a shoreline 2a buffer may be averaged consistent with rmc  habitat buffer averaging 3in those areas of the city where existing upland
