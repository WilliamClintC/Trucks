registered professional engineer and approved by the director of public works pursuant to the provisions of this chapter source   560 1979 improvements agreement guarantee a the subdivision being submitted for approval includes improvements necessary to serve the area being developed it has been customary for the lot price in a subdivision to include payment for the improvements buyers have assumed that the governmental unit approving the subdivision has provided for the improvements at the time of plat approval such expectation has not coincided with the facts as a consequence many have purchased lots in new subdivisions expecting improvements to be constructed and paid for but the subdivider has suffered financial reverses the burden of constructing the improvements then falls upon the buyers and the general public the buyers should not have to pay twice for the improvements and since the improvements are almost wholly for the benefit of the area being developed the general public should not have to absorb any of the costs incident to the construction of the improvements b based upon the above considerations the city council for the protection of buyers in subdivided areas and the general public is of the opinion that a form of guarantee must be furnished by the subdivider to assure the installation of the required public improvements in an approved manner and in a reasonable period of time prior to the presentation and acceptance of the final plat by the city council the subdivider shall execute an agreement with the city of northglenn that guarantees shall be furnished for the construction of all public improvements c building permits will be issued for only that part of the plat for which the required financial guarantee or guarantees has or have been

of northglenn as to the lot or lots covered by the terms of the release f the agreement shall further provide that if at any time there is a breach of such agreement the city of northglenn may withhold approval of all building permits within the subdivision until such breach or breaches have been cured g the minimum guarantee shall be for an area of one block in the event there is a dispute as to the area to be covered by the guarantee the director of the department of community works shall delineate the block of a given subdivision which will serve the needs of the potential residents the guarantee shall provide that improvements shall be completed within twelve 12 months of the issuance of the first building permit or upon completion of 50 percent of the structures which can be erected in such block whichever occurs first in time  however if special circumstances exist the director of the department of community works may extend the time or reduce it if in his opinion in accordance with the generally accepted engineering principles any or all of the improvements are needed in less time for the residents of the area to protect the public health safety and welfare and such decision shall control h the guarantee shall be for 100 percent of the estimated cost of the required public improvements as computed by the city engineer the public improvements referred to are water and sewer mains roadbed and surface gutter sidewalks bridges culverts other storm drainage improvements and street identification and traffic control signs further appropriate arrangements for telephone gas electricity andor street lighting and appurtenances shall be made between the subdivider and the utility company involved the guarantee shall be appropriately reduced or set over to

funds committed to the amount and for the purposes herein stated and that in the event of a default by the subdivider the city shall have available to it upon demand funds necessary to construct all

dedicating such area within the proposed subdivisions the subdivider may dedicate an alternate parcel of the required size within 34 of a mile of the proposed subdivision which is acceptable to the city council after a review and recommendation by the planning commission based upon the standards and considerations as above set forth if a site is accepted such shall be free of all liens and

was unoccupied during all or any portion of the period used to determine winter average such other method shall be just reasonable nondiscriminatory and cost of service based b for accounts utilizing

quantity of water used as reflected by billings for the most recent months of april c for accounts utilizing supplied freshwater only for purposes that do not utilize returnflow usually irrigation

storm water runoff to those facilities beyond the amount of runoff which would occur if the land were undeveloped should pay for the use and his share of the cost of such facilities in addition to these general purposes the city council declares that this ordinance is adopted for the following specific purposes a to promote the public health safety and welfare by permitting the movement of emergency vehicles during flooding periods and to minimize flood losses and the inconvenience and damage resulting from uncontrolled and unplanned storm runoff in the city  b to implement a plan that
