council meeting if it is during a regular council meeting it generally occurs at the point on the agenda where the subject of the public hearing is listed for action in that case the presiding officer must clearly announce the start of the hearing and the adjournment of the hearing so that it is clear when the special rules applicable to the hearing apply and when the rules of procedure for regular council business are restored a record of each public hearing must be kept and should include a a hearing agenda b a record of all the members of the public who participate c proof of any required notice or publication d minutes or a tape of the proceedings e copies of any materials received from the public or distributed to the public 8 disruptive conduct these rules of procedure are adopted based on the expectation that all persons attending a meeting of the city council will be honorable and will conduct themselves with courtesy for all other individuals present in most situations where an individuals conduct becomes disruptive it will be inadvertent and a warning from the presiding officer will be sufficient to correct the offensive behavior if that is not the case or if the presiding officer is determined by council to be disrupting or obstructing the proceedings of a council meeting the following shall apply a it is unlawful for any person to disrupt a meeting of city council if a person who is determined by the presiding officer or by a majority vote of council to be disruptive refuses to discontinue the disruptive behavior the matter will be immediately reported

officer refuses to call for action on a matter on an approved agenda ignores a motion apparently made and seconded in good faith refuses to allow council to vote on an appeal from a decision or ruling of the presiding officer or in any other way refuses to conduct the meeting in accordance with these rules council may by majority vote declare the chair vacated any council member may move to vacate

south carolina freedom of information act requires that an agenda be advertised 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time it has been argued by some parties that this prevents the amendment of the agenda after the advertisement the better argument seems to be that when it is necessary in the public interest to add a matter to the agenda after it is published the council may do so  4  editors note when related to the item being considered an executive session may be held at the time a matter is being discussed if a majority of the council votes to do so  5  editors note there is no state

purpose the city of aiken hereby establishes the empty building incentive program to encourage the use andor redevelopment of empty buildings located throughout the city the city recognizes that there are any number of reasons that contribute to building vacancies with this program the city offers an opportunity to assist new owners in reducing the overhead costs for a startup business the city also seeks to reduce the number of vacated buildings located throughout the city to preserve and promote an attractivelooking city and to enhance the value of real estate throughout the city as an additional purpose the city seeks to reduce development sprawl by encouraging existing buildings to be reused this will reduce development costs as well as the cost of public services to the business community in most cases water sewer and other infrastructure is already available to old unoccupied buildings there is no added cost of running utility lines to more distant locations also by using existing buildings which usually are located in already developed areas we may reduce fuel costs and traffic volumes within the city b incentive for qualifying buildings the owner shall be entitled to an incentive payment to be determined by applying the following formula 1 the total assessed value of the subject property building and land as determined by aiken county prior to construction is subtracted from the total assessed value for the property after construction is complete this is the difference in the improvements to the subject property increase in value 2 the increase in value is then multiplied by 04 for residential uses and 06 for commercial uses this sum is then multiplied by the citys then current millage rate presently 071 as of the 200405 fiscal year that sum is then multiplied by the applicable multiplier based on the number of years the building has been vacant this is the total incentive payment the city will then issue a check to the owner for the full amount of the incentive payment example redevelopment of a property currently assessed by aiken county at $600000 results in a new assessed value of $10000000 the building has been empty for more than four years the calculation looks like this $9400000 increase in value  4 percent 6 percent if commercial property  105 percent if industrial property ________ $376000  071 city millage rate at time of calculation ________ $26700  3 ________ $80088 total incentive payment the owner must be current on all real estate tax payments for the property in order to apply for the incentive program the city shall have up to 60 days to confirm the owners entitlement to the incentive being requested the amount of the incentive is based on the number of years the building has been continuously vacant example if your building qualifies and has been vacant for more than four years your multiplier is three incentive scale continuous vacancy months incentive multiplier 024 no incentive 2436 1 year 3648 2 years 48 + 3 years c requirements to qualify for the incentive payment 1 the building must have been used last for commercial purposes and it must be redeveloped for a commercial purpose or new residential purpose the building must be a minimum size of 30000 heated square feet 2 the building must be located within the city 3 the building must be empty andor vacant continuously for at least

45 as set out herein the former ch 45 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from exh a 11242008 article i  general standards statutory authorization municipality the legislature of the state of south carolina has in sc laws title 5 and title 6 and amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of aiken south carolina does ordain as follows  1exh a 5142018 findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the city of aiken are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  1exh a 5142018 statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this article are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs  1exh a 5142018 lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of aiken as

force  1exh a 5142018 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of aiken or by any officer or
