woodstock connecticut does ordain as follows 12 finding the fact  the flood hazard areas of the town of woodstock are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairments of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare  these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard area by uses vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 13 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 27  restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction   control the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters   control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and   prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which may increase flood hazard to other lands 14 objectives the objectives of this ordinance are  to protect human life and health   to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects   to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public   to minimize prolonged business interruptions   to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges
