particularly within the sedona business district and the fact that the volume of such activities has resulted in numerous complaints by pedestrians and tourists about the aggressive and persistent actions of such persons attempting to engage them in a conversation in order to consummate a business transaction it is the intent of this section to preserve and protect the unique charm and small town character of the sedona business district which serves as a major attraction to millions of tourists each year bthe city is committed to maintaining its small town character scenic beauty and natural resources which are the foundation of its economic strength and quality of life sedona community plan recommendations goal 10 these essential components of the citys attractiveness to residents and visitors have been severely impaired by the practice of aggressive offpremises canvassing particularly as practiced in the central tourist destination of the sedona business district cbetween 1996 and 200 the city received copies of more than 150 written complaints as well as indications of numerous additional verbal complaints from visitors to the city regarding the aggressive offpremises canvassing activities conducted in the sedona business district a number of the complaining visitors described these activities as ruining the special character of the city which was their reason for visiting and expressed their determination not to return to the city because the aggressive offpremises canvassing had destroyed its attractiveness as a place to visit dthis section is therefore directed solely to the regulation of the time place and manner of certain limited forms of commercial speech with the general goal of requiring that persontoperson solicitation activities initiated by businesses or their representatives and directed toward the traveling public in the sedona business district are confined to enclosed structures or on the actual business premises of the soliciting entity this section is not intended to regulate any form of speech other than speech designed to do no more than propose a commercial transaction neither is this section intended to prohibit in any way the rights of the traveling public to inquire or seek information or initiate simple transactions from outside an enclosed structure egiven the unique commingling of both public and privately owned sidewalks throughout the sedona business district which are equally accessible without restriction by tourists and pedestrians the purposes of this section can only be made effective if the restrictions contained herein are applied to both public and private sidewalks 2tourism is essential to the citys fiscal strength sedonas friendly small town environment has historically played a substantial role in making it an attractive tourist destination by making the city a gateway community such as a place to which visitors may come to escape the congestion

advertising has negatively affected the experience of tourists visitors and residents and has created a disincentive for tourists and visitors to return such advertising destroys the smalltown character of the city and creates confrontations between residents visitors and merchants thereby adversely impacting the health safety and wellbeing of the public these concerns are particularly present with timeshare or vacation club membership sellers and solicitors who have been known to implement misleading signage as evidenced by a plethora of written and oral complaints documented by reference in these complaints substantiate the fact that some signs used by timeshare andor vacation club establishments in the city convey the clear impression that their sales solicitation establishments are instead nonprofit or government sponsored tourist information centers or are other types of establishments such as museums such deception has a negative impact on the tourism industry and economy of the city of sedona negative experiences by visitors who have been lured into establishments believing that their sole purpose is that of dispensing tourist information are then disseminated to friends and acquaintances and are published on internet social media and tourism sites tarnishing the positive reputation of sedona as a tourist destination site because of these negative impacts on the health safety and welfare of tourists visitors and residents deceptive and misleading advertising constitutes a public nuisance that must be addressed of rules and regulations designed to curb the proliferation of deceptive signs and advertisements therefore the city council finds it necessary to impose additional regulations in order to prevent residents and visitors from

sites on previously developed andor graded sites the director may require an alternative determination of the location of natural grade from which height will be measured from based on previous grading and the surrounding natural grade cplane options building height is measured by establishing 1horizontal plane an imaginary horizontal plane from the highest point at natural grade within the footprint of the building no part of a building or structure shall exceed 22 feet in height for singlefamily uses or 25 feet for multifamily uses as measured from this plane except for those authorized exceptions in e3 commercial mixeduse and other nonresidential buildings may not use this plane measurement see 1 in figure 26  and 2parallel plane an imaginary plane that parallels the existing natural terrain measured vertically from any point of the building or structure to natural grade no part of a building or structure exclusive of the exceptions in e3 andor the alternate

table 31 land uses and activities are classified into general use categories and specific use types based on common functional product or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions this classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts this classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within each use category certain uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories the use categories are intended as an indexing tool and are not regulatory for example the use category residential contains two use subcategories household living and group living specific use types such as dwelling duplex and assisted living facility are regulatory cuse for other purposes prohibited approval of a use listed in table 31 and compliance with the applicable usespecific standards for that use authorizes that use only buildings and structures shall not be erected altered or enlarged except for the uses listed in table 31 all other uses not specifically listed are prohibited and shall be unlawful unless the director has determined an appropriate use type for the unlisted use pursuant to the procedure in

succinct message is simpler and faster to read looks cleaner and is generally more attractive 4font styles aan effective sign should do more than attract attention  it should communicate its message clearly this is directly related to the readability of words and phrases the most signicant inuence on legibility is lettering style and spacing typefaces that are difficult to read reduce the signs ability to communicate crowding letters words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read conversely overspacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually again obscuring the message bsigns should use letters on a contrasting background cthere should be an adequate amount of contrast between the colors to increase legibility if there is little contrast between the brightness or hue of the message of a sign and its background it will be difficult to read bsign placement in order to assist in waynding signs throughout a development site should be placed in a
