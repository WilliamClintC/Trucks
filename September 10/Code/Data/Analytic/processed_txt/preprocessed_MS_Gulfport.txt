businesses are located 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread

require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 21 removal

such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal

article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article 25 the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of five 5 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted

characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods public parks churches public buildings schools and other such similar facilities thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health safety and welfare and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality and bring crime to an area b it has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods the stability of property values and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values increase crime and violence and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods it is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods it is the further purpose of this article to protect the wellbeing of the citizens of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these clinics by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as without limitation churches parks schools and residential areas c it is not the intent of this article to inhibit the operation of these clinics or to inhibit the availability of opiod medication to those to whom it is legally prescribed or to inhibit the ability of persons to sell plasma legally d the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the ability of one who has been legally prescribed opiod medication to obtain those medications or the ability of one who desires to sell hisher plasma similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access to opiod medication by those for whom opiod medication has been prescribed or to restrict or deny access to a location where plasma may be sold legally this article represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental contentneutral place time and manner regulation of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers the regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these businesses are set forth in this article e neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution sale or

defined herein on the community in reports made available to the citys governing authorities the citys governing authorities mayor and city council make and identify the following nonexhaustive findings 1 rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers hereinafter clinics and centers lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activity that are presently uncontrolled or uncontrollable by the operators of the clinics and centers 2 anecdotal evidence demonstrates that criminal activity occurs with more frequency in neighborhoods where clinics and centers are located including petit larcenies vehicular burglaries attempted burglaries theft intimidation trespassing vandalism sale or purchase of illicit substances andor methadone 3 illicit exchange of methadone for money on clinic property is disturbing and illegal and not something that the city welcomes in its residential neighborhoods or commercial areas 4 use of funds derived from sale of plasma at centers for the purchase of illegal drugs is disturbing and not something that the city welcomes in its neighborhoods or commercial areas 5 public urination and public defecation ie lewd conduct by clients of the clinics are reported and witnessed on clinics grounds and on property owned by others and such diminishes the quality of life in or around residential or commercial neighborhoods 6 erratic driving and driving at high rates of speed have been witnessed and reported in areas around clinics and such is not conducive to residential or commercial neighborhoods 7 patrons of clinics are known to arrive early sometimes hours before the clinic opens and to loiter in the parking lots of the clinics for hours  clinics attract a large number of patrons on any given day which greatly increases traffic in the area of the clinic 8 patrons of centers are known to depart the centers and immediately utilize the funds obtained to procure illicit drugs at nearby facilities or business entities 9 erratic behavior by patrons of clinics has been demonstrated to be of concern to neighboring property owners 10 the findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1 9 raise substantial governmental concerns and require immediate attention to protect the public health and safety 11 rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 12 a reasonable zoning and other regulations are appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers further such regulations will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city 13 placing rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers in areas of the city which are removed generally from residential and commercial areas will enhance the citys ability to protect the public health and safety and to allow these businesses to operate in a manner that least restricts their ability to accomplish their commercial goals 14 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment

application for approval shall be denied iv considering all elements of design review as a whole permits with minor variations not harmful to compatibility will not be unreasonably denied 3 general compatibility requirement i assuming that surrounding structures are considered by the design review board to be a credit to the community all development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the surrounding area by using a design that is complementary to nearby architectural styles designs and forms this does not imply uniformity of architectural style  rather it requires that new buildings are sympathetically responsive to aspects of nearby structures building aesthetics 1 purpose building aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures these regulations strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand while avoiding obtrusive incongruous structures on the other the city

ordinance book adult entertainment businesses article i purpose intent and findings a purpose and intent 1 in the development and adoption of the ordinance codified in this section it is recognized that there are some adult business uses which have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods public parks churches public buildings schools and other such similar facilities thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health safety and welfare and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality 2 it has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods the stability of property values and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values increase crime and violence and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods it is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods it is the further purpose of this protect the wellbeing of the youth of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these adult uses by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as without limitation churches parks schools and residential areas 3 in recognition of the protections affording to the citizens under the first and fourteenth amendments it is not the intent of this section to inhibit freedom of speech or the press it is further the belief that just as advertising is designed to stimulate ones appetite for desiring goods or services an overabundance or preoccupation with sexual displays or materials arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied and encourages violations of the criminal statutes involving sexual offenses and is contrary to the health and safety of the community 4 the provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market this section represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental contentneutral place time and manner regulation of adult entertainment businesses without limiting alternative avenues of communication the regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth in this section 5 neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials b

the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota and statistics obtained from the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention all of which are fully adopted and incorporated herein the citys governing authorities the mayor and city council make and identify the following nonexhaustive findings 1 adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where adult entertainment businesses are located 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 as of 200 the total number of reported cases of aids in the united states caused by the immunodeficiency virus hiv was one million eighteen thousand four hundred twentyeight 1018428 8 in the year of 2007 there were three hundred fiftytwo 352 reported new cases of aids and hiv infected individuals in the state 9 the total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the united states reported in 1997 was five hundred twentysix thousand six hundred fiftythree 526653 an eight 8 percent increase over the year 1996 10 the total number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported during the twelveyear period 19851997 was three hundred eightyseven thousand two hundred thirtythree 387233 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with a total of one million nine hundred one thousand three hundred sixtyfive 1901365 cases reported during the period 19931997 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug use exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids including semen and urine are found in the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution increases sexual assaults and attracts other criminal activity 17 nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use 18 the findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1 raise substantial governmental concerns and requires immediate attention to protect the public health and safety 19 adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 20 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment businesses further such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 21 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 22 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 23 it is desirable in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this section 25 the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of five 5 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 26 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by

shall be limited by the same maximum and absolute maximum buildingscale densities for transect zones t1 and t2 no buildingscale density limits shall be defined  for each lot within a t4 or higher transect zone in the community planning area the maximum buildingscale density multiplied by the area of the lot yields the density allowance for that lot for transect zone t3 the density allowance for lots is always one 1 unit per lot with the exception of cases described in provisions   and  below structures built on a lot shall be limited to a number of equivalent housing units which is less than or equal to the byright density allowance equivalent housing units represent a combination of mixed use space lodging bedrooms and independent residential units according to the following conversation schedule a one independent residential unit constitutes one equivalent housing unit b one thousand square feet of office or retail space constitutes one equivalent housing unit c two lodging bedrooms constitute one equivalent housing unit  density transfer receiving areas  density bonus receiving areas the existingcommunity plan may designate buildingscale areas the byright density allowance may be exceeded for a lot within a designated density transfer receiving area or bonus receiving area on the existingcommunity plan by an amount equal to the acquired density allowance for the lot so long as the sum of byright and acquired density allowances does not exceed the absolute maximum density allowance for that lot a density transfer receiving areas are chosen for their ability to support localized additional density without a net increase of the citys overall density and with lesser ill effects on public welfare and goals of the comprehensive plan than if that density increment had not been transferred b density bonus receiving areas are chosen to minimize the impact of slight increases of density to achieve improved urban structure and other goals benefiting community welfare as set forth in the comprehensive plan and to offset any ill effects of an increase in density with advantages accruing from the density placement or the action which led to the granting of the bonus c density bonuses and transfers notwithstanding in no case may the number of equivalent housing units incorporated into a lot exceed the absolute maximum density allowance for such lot d for lots in t3 zones the absolute maximum density allowance is one 1 equivalent housing unit per lot e acquired density may originate from any density sending area in the city of

acquired from civic space density transfer sending areas the existingcommunity plan may include explanation for the designation of a parcel as csdt sending area and may place conditions on the sending area designation which are consistent with the reason for designation in addition under the csdt program multiple parcels within a single pedestrian shed may be designated as a linked sending group in such a case once one parcel has had its density rights extracted for use as a civic space the remaining linked sending group parcels are no longer eligible to become density donors and their designation as csdt sending areas expires b conservation density transfer sending areas are sites worthy of conservation due to scenic beauty unsuitability for building critical habitat riparian

anticipated future transportation corridors after extraction of density rights tgrdt sending areas within a community planning area shall be rezoned as transect zone t1 any area lot or parcel designated as a density transfer receiving area in an official community plan may receive density rights acquired from tgrdt sending areas thoroughfares eventually constructed on former tgrdt sending

voluntary in the creation of an existingcommunity plan all such sending areas shall be assigned to transect zones for development according to the methods of transectbased urban structure to provide seamless urban fabric in the event density transfer options go unused  density recovery transfers density recovery transfers are transfers of density allowance intended to compensate a property owner for the public dedication of a portion of a parcel or lot which has been recommended for public use in the existingcommunity plan as the area of the land to be dedicated is lost to the property owner a density allowance equal to the maximum buildingscale density for the lot multiplied by the area of the portion of land to be dedicated is permanently attached to the remaining lot so that the total density allowance of the lot before and after the dedication is unchanged the following recommendations on the special requirements and options map of the existingcommunity plan entitle a lot to a density recovery transfer should the dedication be executed a through street recommended b service lane recommended c any recommendation accompanied by the designation density recovery transfer applies  density bonuses density bonuses may be generally available throughout a community planning area may be limited to the designated density bonus receiving areas on an existingcommunity plan or may be restricted to lots specially designated on an existingcommunity plan according to the details of the particular density bonus program in no case may the absolute maximum density allowance for a lot be exceeded by a receiving lot once awarded a density bonus is valid for up to 10 years from the date of award  if not used within that period the bonus becomes null and void a transit site density bonus this density bonus may be attached to any lot within any density bonus receiving area within the city and requires the dedication to the city of a site within an area designated on the street and parking plan for a publicparking facility or for a future transit station the dedication may reflect that the site must be used to provide publicparking facilities or transit station the amount of the bonus is the byright density allowance of the site and the recipient lot of the bonus may be designated by the owner of the property to be dedicated b street dedication bonus this density bonus shall only be available to lots marked on the special requirements and options plan with the designations through street recommended or service lane recommended in order to be eligible

comply with the requirements of this amount of the bonus is one 1 equivalent housing unit for each of the two new lots resulting from a thoroughfare dedication or one 1 equivalent housing unit for one of the two new lots as designated by the lot owner resulting from a service lane or service alley dedication the street dedication bonus shall not exceed four 4 units per increment of two hundred feet of dedicated street nor one 1 unit per increment of one hundred feet of service lane or alley length a street dedication bonus accruing for a thoroughfare service lane or alley dedication in a t3 zone may be applied to any lot in a density bonus receiving area in the city designated by the owner of the original lot or parcel the crc may award a partial street dedication bonus for dedication of rightofway andor completed construction of the public frontage by warrant c affordable housing density bonus the affordable housing density bonus program is a buildingscale bonus available generally to any lot within a designated density bonus receiving area it is described in d affordable housing height bonus the affordable housing height bonus program is a buildingscale bonus available generally to any lot within a designated density bonus receiving area it is described in additional height allowances and acquired density allowance the acquisition of density allowance units by density transfers and bonuses may entitle a lot to an additional height allowance in excess of the maximum height otherwise allowed within the assigned transect zone according to the details of the density bonus or transfer program the existingcommunity plan shall include a formula or table to determine the additional height allowance associated with a particular total acquired density allowance for each transect zone additional height allowances may further be limited to designated city centers density receiving areas or other designated areas the relationship between additional height allowances and acquired density allowance specified in the existingcommunity plan shall be guided by the following provisions a the number of additional acquired density allowance units required for eligibility for an additional story of height allowance shall be proportional to the area of the site b the number of additional acquired density allowance units per site acre required for eligibility for an additional story of height allowance shall be no less than the quotient of the maximum buildingscale density for the transect zone and the maximum height for the transect zone in which the site is located c the number of additional acquired density allowance units required for an additional story of height allowance after the second should generally increase with total height allowance in order to reflect the added toll on surrounding areas exacted by a structure of greater height however d the minimum number of acquired density allowance units required to qualify for the first additional story of height allowance may be greater than the additional number of acquired density allowance units required to qualify for the second additional story and for subsequent additional stories of height allowance 45  reserved 46  streetscape requirements  general within zones t4 pedestrian comfort and safety shall be a primary consideration of all thoroughfare design rehabilitation
