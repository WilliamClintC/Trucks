main extends north toward state route hh to accommodate existing and possible future citizens of the city in order to offset the cost of the construction of this sewer main the city is charging those residing in the improvement area an impact fee which exceeds the current $5000 inspection fee for connecting to the main the improvement area encompasses all of the properties inside the city limits which have or would potentially have sewer that will drain to this sewer main or one of its future branches citizens will be required to connect to this new main when it is within 100 feet of any property line of their structure see section 114175 this would include existing and proposed structures see section 114220 those not currently inside the city limits who wish to connect to this sewer

facility within 60 days after connection to the public sewer system these impact fees do not include the cost in making the physical connection to the sewer main this connection shall be made by the property holder under the supervision of the city see section 114176 impact fees shall be paid to the city before services are allowed to connect to the public sewer main c the expansion of this public sewer main is contingent upon the acquisition of easements all easements necessary for this sewer expansion would be required before the start of construction easement acquisition would need to be a cooperative effort between the city and the citizen or citizens wanting the public sewer the city would request that all easements be given to the city so the cost of construction is not increased if easements are not given the city council will decide the price per foot that the city will pay for all easements in the improvement area and in turn whether the impact fees outlined above need be adjusted d the design and development of sewer mains for future subdivisions in the improvement area would still be the responsibility of the developer during the citys review process of these subdivisions the city may wish to modify the developers design in order to accommodate any further expansion of the sewer main the city may compensate the developer for these modifications  21015 secs
