may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the

separation between vehicles and pedestrians and present an attractive appearance in urban areas curbs have a major benefit in containing the drainage within the pavement area and in channelizing or controlling traffic into and out of adjacent properties 8 1 5 1 warrants  curbed  selecting a curbed section or uncurbed section depends upon many variables including vehicular speeds urbanrural location drainage and construction costs the following discusses those factors which will determine whether or not a curbed section is warranted 1 urban location because of restricted right of way and other constraints curbed sections are typically used in urban areas suburban location where design speeds 50 mph or more uncurbed sections are typically used the exceptions listed under #3 for rural locations also apply to highspeed suburban facilities where design speeds are less than 50 mph the use of a curbed or uncurbed section will be made on a projectbyproject basis considering rightofway constraints drainage pedestrian activity channelization needs driveway access control etc 3 rural location the use of curbs on rural highways is usually limited to conditions such as the followinga ollowing a where a raised median is present  b where there is sufficient development along the highway and there is a need to channelize traffic into and out of properties  c where it is absolutely necessary to control drainage  d where restricted rightofway provides no room for roadside ditches  andor c at other sites  eg interchanges intersections as determined by the geometric design branch 14 16 11 8 1 5 2 curb types there are two basic types of curbs  mountable and barrier by definition mountable curbs have a height of6 inches or less with a face no steeper than i horizontal to 3 vertical barrier curbs may range in height between 6 inches and 12 inches with a face steeper than i horizontal to 3 vertical figure 8 1c presents the basic curb types used by odot the odot standard drawings provide additional information on the design details and placement for the different curb types this includes details on driveway radii construction items etc 8 1 53 curb type selection the following discusses those factors which should be considered when selecting a curb type 1 material concrete curbs are typically used 2 outside curb barrier curbs are typically used on the outside of the roadway 3 raised medians mountable curbs are typically used with raised medians 4 s reeds barrier curbs may be used where the design speed is 45 mph or less mountable curbs may be used at any design speed 5 vehicular encroachment where sidewalks roadside appurtenances etc are present it is desirable to restrict vehicular encroachment beyond the curb although no curb type will prohibit encroachments barrier curbs are superior to mountable curbs where vehicular encroachment is permissible or even desirable mountable curbs should be used 6 sidewalks where sidewalks are present barrier curbs are typically used 7 local practices where local practices differ from odot practices odot criteria should prevail on state highways on non state highways local practices will normally govern l

amount of tax and requiring collection before issuance of a building permit  providing for accounting for taxes collected and restricting uses for proceeds of the tax to capital improvements and to pay debt service obligations issued to finance future capital improvements of the city including but not limited to improvements and expansion of the water wastewater and roadway systems of the city of piedmont  providing for submittal of the tax proposition to the qualified electors of the city of piedmont  providing for effective date  providing for repealer and severability  and declaring an emergency be it ordained by the city council of the city of piedmont oklahoma legislative findings the city council of the city of piedmont oklahoma finds and recommends that the costs of future improvements and expansion to the city s capital improvement needs should be borne by the users whose demand has created the need for future expansion of city facilities and capital improvements the capital needs of the city continue to expand as the population grows but the amount of revenues received by the city from its available revenue sources has failed to provide sufficient funds to meet the need for capital expenditures the imposition of a development excise tax on new construction provides a method where new development bears its proportionate costs of capital facilities necessitated by such new development the city council desires to establish a mechanism to finance the future growth and expansion of the city s infrastructure needs including water systems wastewater system and roadways upon recommendation of its professional staff and consultants based further on recommendation of the city s planning commission and piedmont municipal authority the city council has and does hereby determine that such costs should be in the future imposed upon the development of land with the collection of an excise tax to be collected at the date of issuance of the building permit on each new structure excluding only the construction of accessory buildings the city council finds that there are a number of vacant lots in approved subdivisions and future subdivisions either platted or soon to be platted the development of which will impose an increased demand on the city s capital needs including but not limited to water wastewater and roadway systems and the city council therefore finds that it is necessary to adopt the provisions of this excise tax for the imposition of appropriate costs on such lots and future developments in order to provide the necessary and essential services required to provide for the health safety and welfare of the owners and occupants of these new structures a new law is hereby adopted to read as follows development excise tax 1 there is hereby established and imposed a new development excise tax to be levied and collected on new construction in the following amounts and to be used as set forth herein a for all new construction excluding accessory building construction the sum of $ for each structure up to 2200 square feet and $ per square foot for each square foot of building in excess of 2200 square feet for building expansions which include the installation of any plumbing fixtures the sum of $_ per square foot for each additional square foot added to the existing structure b the tax imposed herein shall be collected at the time a building permit is issued based upon the square footage of the building for which the permit is issued c the funds collected from the imposition of this development excise tax shall be used only for capital improvements of the city including but not limited to the future expansion and improvements of the city s water wastewater and roadway systems funds collected shall

community both in the urban area and on the fringes of the urban development is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions in the area good community design can be accomplished by following a few principles these better approaches to the layout of new areas result in a more livable community the violation of some of the basic rules concerning design of streets ditches and other features can lead to such unpleasant situations as streets that deteriorate and are expensive to maintain street intersections that are dangerous drainage ditches that clog up and cause flooding building lots that are difficult or expensive to construct upon or difficulties with erosion during the time of development and even throughout the life of the home the figures which follow show some of the better ways of creating a subdivision the use of good design and holding to these methods of development can provide for the least expense in the building of a subdivision this is especially true considering the costs that come to the purchasers of property that has been improperly developed and the fact that there is no cheaper time to solve development problems than before houses are built and lots are sold the intent of these design standards is to prevent the strip platting of land onto arterials as shown in the shaded area of figure 51 for the reasons as set forth below no plat shall be approved which provides for platting of lots fronting onto arterials except in the limited case where owing to unusual circumstances a variance is granted as provided in  of these regulations see appendix a figure 51 figure 51 shows some of the patterns of streets and lots that might be possible in the development of areas in large rural estates type lots in the shaded area is shown a frequent approach to the creating of lots in rural settings there are a number of problems from the arrangement of lots in a road frontage strip as in the shaded area such as 1 long narrow parcels which are of reduced usefulness to the buyer 2 increased numbers of driveways intersecting arterials this is a problem for the county to keep ditches and culverts clean and working 3 the narrower lots result in closer spacing of houses with less privacy and greater possibility of individual sewer disposal system failures and 4 the frontage of each house upon an arterial street means greater exposure of the dust traffic litter and drainage problems which occur also there is a loss of privacy and the danger that the road may have to be widened at some time in the futuretaking part of the front lawn some of the other styles of lot arrangements can provide more usable shape more privacy safer traffic more workable utility layout better spacing of buildings etc from the standpoint of planning for the future there is one major advantage to the unshaded lots over those in the shaded area street frontage striptype lots that is development in rural areas such as this usually occurs without the availability of public sewer and sometimes without water however at a later time these utilities are often made available as the population of the area increases once utilities are available there may be a desire to divide some of the lots again it can be seen that with the long narrow lots of the street frontage type development there is little that can be done in the way of redividing a lot on the other hand the more square shaped lots of the other layouts would be much easier to change and divide this has been proven to be of value numerous times as towns have grown out and around areas that were developed when they were out in the country design of neighborhood features a streets the purpose of classifying streets by functions is to plan for future development in an orderly fashion to reduce the total longterm cost to the public and to improve mobility and safety on streets by assessing street function for traffic volume speed and land accesses the arrangement
