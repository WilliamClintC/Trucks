direct costs to the beneficiaries b this program is not intended for everyone in the case of many of those convicted of socalled minor traffic offenses the administrative costs of placing a person in

and placed the time spent in this administrative coordination shall not be credited against the amount of time required to be served in the program also the subjective factor involving the attitude of the convicted applicant is to be considered in light of what is stated by the city council to be the underlying caution in this program that no person be injured in any manner and that no property

conditions of suspension of the sentence and in such case the otherwise suspended sentence shall at least in part be imposed b5     determination of eligibility by judge a in determining the eligibility of any convicted applicant for participation in the alternative sentencing program the sentencing judge may consider the ability of the convicted applicant to satisfy the goals of this program as stated in if the sentencing judge shall so determine the convicted applicant may be denied participation in the alternative sentencing program based on the judges decision that the convicted applicants abilities andor level of motivation is not consistent with the stated goals of the program upon making such determination the judge may simply refer to this as a denial and shall not be required to provide any additional explanation b in addition to those factors stated in subsection a of this section the sentencing judge shall also consider 1 the occupation or other skills of the convicted applicant 2 the current needs of the community including the needs of the various departments of the city and any seasonal needs which the community may experience 3 the benefit to be

division 1  generally title this article shall be known and cited as the sign the city of thornton exh a 61317 authority the city council finds and declares that 1 the city has the authority to regulate signs under the united states constitution the constitution and statutes of the state of colorado and the charter of the city of thornton  2 this article advances important and substantial government interests  3 the purpose of this article is to provide the minimum control of signs necessary to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of thornton  4 this article is not intended to regulate government signs  5 any incidental restriction on the freedom of speech is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the interests protected by this article  6 certain types of speech are not protected by the first amendment due to the harm that they cause to individuals or the community and speech that is harmful to minors may be prohibited in places that are accessible to minors  and 7 the city does not intend to regulate any sign content or message in any manner not permitted by law and the provisions of this article should be interpreted to achieve that result exh a 61317 purpose a generally the purpose of this article is to set out regulations for the erection and maintenance of signs while preserving the right of free speech and expression b objectives the objective of the regulations in this article is to provide a balanced and fair legal framework for the design construction and placement of signs that 1 promotes the safety of persons and property by ensuring that signs do not create a hazard by a collapsing catching fire or otherwise decaying  b confusing or distracting vehicle bicycle or pedestrian traffic  or c impairing drivers ability to see pedestrians bicyclists obstacles or other vehicles or to read traffic signs  2 promotes the efficient communication of messages and ensures that persons exposed to signs a are not overwhelmed by the number of messages presented  and b are able to exercise freedom of choice to observe or ignore said messages  3 protects the public welfare and enhances the appearance and economic value of the landscape by protecting scenic views and avoiding sign clutter that can compromise the character quality and viability of commercial corridors  4 ensures that signs are compatible with their surroundings and prevents the construction of signs that are a nuisance to occupants of adjacent and contiguous property due to brightness reflectivity bulk movement or height  5 promotes the use of signs that are aesthetically pleasing of appropriate scale and integrated with the built environment landscaping and other features in order to meet the citys objectives related to the quality and character of development as identified in the comprehensive plan  6 enhances property values and business opportunities  7 assists in wayfinding  and 8 provides fair and consistent permitting and enforcement c general findings of fact the city council finds and declares that 1 signs of reasonable size and dimensions are a useful means of visual display for the convenience of the public and for the efficient communications of commercial and noncommercial speech  2 signs are vital to the health and sustainability of many businesses and the display of signs with noncommercial messages is a traditional forum of speech but the constitutional guarantee of free speech may be limited by appropriate and constrained regulation that is unrelated to the message itself  3 the city has an important and substantial interest in protecting the public from signs which obscure the vision of motorists or interfere with official traffic control devices because the orderly movement of traffic contributes to the public health and safety  4 the city has an important and substantial interest in preventing sign clutter because sign clutter degrades the character of the community makes the community a less attractive place for commerce and private investment and dilutes or obscures messages by creating visual confusion and aesthetic blight  5 a reasonable balance between the interests of visual signage and the interest of the city to secure for its citizens the opportunity to enjoy pleasant and attractive surroundings protected from visual discord and clutter that may result from unrestricted proliferation and placement of signs contributes to the general welfare  6 regulations that balance the legitimate needs of individual property owners to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages against the comparable needs of adjacent and nearby property owners and the interest of the community as a whole are necessary to preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of life in the community  7 the uncontrolled use of offpremises outdoor advertising signs and their location density size shape motion illumination and demand for attention can be injurious to the purposes of this article and destructive to community character and property values and that as such restrictions on the display of offpremises commercial messages are necessary and desirable  8 signs

developer which at the time of completion of construction by the initial developer could provide service to connectors to qualify for reimbursement under this section a lift station shall have been constructed to a capacity which the development engineering director determines is in excess of that reasonably required by the initial developer water infrastructure includes but is not limited to water transmission and distribution lines all other water lines and related appurtenances larger than eight inches in diameter and pressure reducing valves and booster pump stations which are sized to a capacity which the development engineering director determines is in excess of that required by the initial developer notwithstanding the above the cost of constructing a booster pump station shall not be eligible for reimbursement when the development engineering director requires that a booster pump station be constructed to a capacity which is the minimum required by the standards and specifications for the design and construction of public improvements as amended from time to time  102505 initial installation the total cost of design and construction of any infrastructure shall be the responsibility of the initial developer whose development necessitates the initial installation of the infrastructure as required by city cost or portions thereof may be recovered by the initial developer pursuant to the reimbursement procedure described in this section  102505 reimbursable costs for water infrastructure the initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for water infrastructure construction cost as modified by the inflation factor on the following basis 1 water infrastructure constructed by the initial developer shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors based on the ratio of the connectors linear front footage to the total linear footage of the infrastructure if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on only one side of the infrastructure the connector shall pay 50 percent of the construction cost as modified by the inflation factor for that front footage if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on both sides of the infrastructure the connector shall pay 100 percent of the construction cost as modified by the inflation factor for that front footage 2 water infrastructure shall be deemed to be contiguous to a connectors property where the water infrastructure is located within a public rightofway or easement which in turn abuts the connectors property or where the water infrastructure crosses or touches any boundary of the connectors property or which benefits the connectors property as determined by the development engineering director linear footage of the water infrastructure fronting a property shall be deemed to extend to the centerline of public rightsofway or easement in which such water infrastructure may be located the development engineering director shall have the authority to determine the appropriate contiguity in the event intervening tracts run adjacent to the water infrastructure  102505 reimbursable costs for wastewater infrastructure the initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for wastewater infrastructure construction cost as modified by the inflation factor on the following basis 1 the reimbursement amount for a connector shall be calculated by prorating the wastewater infrastructure construction cost by the percentage of the capacity required for the connectors property to the total capacity of the infrastructure based on the overall flow for the basin being served by each section of infrastructure 2 limitations on reimbursement amounts a in the event that a connector desires to connect to wastewater infrastructure and it is determined by the development engineering director that the subdivision plat for the connecting property will require less capacity than projected in the initial developers reimbursement agreement then the construction cost to be reimbursed as modified by the inflation factor shall be adjusted based on the projected flows required by the connectors subdivision plat and not based on the initial developers projected capacity the reimbursement amounts for the remaining properties not yet connected will not be changed from the amounts shown in the reimbursement agreement as a result of this event b in the event that a connector desires to connect to wastewater infrastructure and it is determined by the development engineering director that the subdivision plat for the connecting property will require more capacity than projected in the initial developers reimbursement agreement then the connector shall reimburse the initial developer for the construction cost as adjusted by the inflation factor originally projected by the initial developers reimbursement agreement and not a higher amount based on the revised capacity required by the subdivision plat for the connectors property at the time of connection  102505 reimbursable costs for drainage infrastructure the initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for drainage infrastructure construction cost as modified by the inflation factor the reimbursable cost will be attributed entirely to the property in which the infrastructure eligible for reimbursement is situated in the event the infrastructure is situated on more than one property the cost shall be prorated between the properties as determined by the development engineering director  102505 reimbursable costs for street infrastructure the initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for street infrastructure construction cost as modified by the inflation factor on the following basis 1 street infrastructure constructed by the initial developer per the thoroughfare master plan to full width and in accordance with the citys standards and specifications for the design and construction of public improvements as amended from time to time shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors based on the ratio of the connectors linear front footage to the total linear footage of the infrastructure if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on only one side of the infrastructure the connector shall reimburse 50 percent of the construction cost as modified by the inflation factor for that front footage if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on both sides of the infrastructure the connector shall reimburse 100 percent of the construction cost as modified by the inflation factor for that front footage 2 street infrastructure shall be deemed to be contiguous to a connectors property where the street infrastructure is adjacent to the connectors property or where the street infrastructure crosses or touches any boundary of the connectors property or where the street infrastructure benefits the connectors property as determined by the development engineering director linear footage of the street infrastructure fronting a property shall be deemed to extend to the centerline of public rightsofway in which such street infrastructure may be located the development engineering director shall have the authority to determine the appropriate contiguity in the event intervening tracts run adjacent to the street infrastructure  102505 application for reimbursement agreement requirements a application for reimbursement agreement upon approval of construction drawings by development engineering the initial developer of any property who constructs infrastructure may file with the development engineering director an application for a reimbursement agreement the complete application or portions thereof may be submitted  however incomplete applications as determined at the sole discretion of the development engineering director will not be reviewed or acted upon by the city in order for the city to collect estimated reimbursement payments as described in  6267b prior to the final execution of a reimbursement agreement the initial developer shall submit at a minimum the items required in subsection a1 2 3 5 and 8 of this section upon submission of these items provided they are acceptable to the city as described herein the city will require connectors to pay estimated reimbursement amounts as specified in  6267b notwithstanding the foregoing the application for reimbursement agreement shall not be considered complete until all application requirements are submitted once the submitted application is determined complete and acceptable to the city the city will provide the initial developer with a reimbursement agreement  however the reimbursement agreement shall not be executed until after the time to file a request for an administrative hearing has expired and any administrative hearings which were requested are resolved the application shall include 1 payment of the nonrefundable application fee 2 an exhibit depicting the infrastructure suitable for inclusion in the reimbursement agreement as determined by the development engineering director 3 documentation including an ownership map acceptable to the city showing all the properties affected by the proposed reimbursement agreement and any other documentation related to ownership as may be required by the development engineering director 4 a list of the names mailing addresses of the property owners and the tax ownership identification numbers for the properties within the boundaries of the proposed reimbursement agreement area accompanied by a written ownership and encumbrance report from a title company or similar document acceptable to the development engineering director evidencing proof of ownership of all property subject to the reimbursement agreement 5 a report acceptable to the city detailing the actual construction cost and the resulting reimbursement amount proposed to be collected from each property and calculations substantiating the amounts the initial developer may submit an estimated construction cost prior to taking bids so that the city may collect estimated reimbursement amounts from connectors pursuant to  6267b in this event the initial developer shall submit a revised report that details the estimated construction cost the actual construction cost and calculations modifying the reimbursement amount for each property to reflect the actual construction cost estimated and actual costs shall be based on infrastructure designed to meet the current versions of the citys standards and specifications for the design and construction of public improvements as amended from time to time the citys current infrastructure master plans or based on other design requirements as otherwise determined by the development engineering director 6 the initial developer shall obtain and submit a minimum of three independent construction bids for the infrastructure the bids shall include an itemized unit price schedule of values that provides cost break down into the units needed to clearly cost each and every item for each property included in the proposed reimbursement agreement if any post bid change orders are proposed for inclusion in the reimbursable amount the change order cost shall be based on the itemized unit prices contained in the bid whenever possible or when itemized unit prices are not available the change order amount shall be based on reasonable construction costs the reasonableness thereof as determined at the sole discretion of the development engineering director complete documentation of all post bid change orders shall be submitted with the application regardless of which contractor is selected by the initial developer to construct the infrastructure the initial developer shall use the lowest responsible bidders itemized unit price schedule of values to calculate the reimbursable amounts for each property notwithstanding the above if the initial developer is unable to obtain three independent construction bids as required the initial developer may make a request of the citys contract manager to waive the requirement in this event the initial developer shall provide documentation to the contract manager of the extenuating circumstances that precluded obtaining three independent bids the contract manager shall have the sole discretion to determine if the documentation of the extenuating circumstances is sufficient to waive the requirement for three independent bids 7 a notarized affidavit from the initial developer attesting to the construction cost and to the fact that the work was bid to at least three independent contractors the affidavit shall be supported with complete documentation including copies of all vendor consultant and contactor bids proposals invoices and other relevant documents to support the validity of the construction cost in the event the requirement for three independent bids was waived by the citys contract manager the affidavit will describe the bidding process that was used the initial developer shall attest that all information contained in the application for reimbursement agreement is true and correct 8 exhibits of a size and scale suitable for use in the reimbursement agreement as determined by the development engineering director that clearly define the reimbursement boundaries proposed for the infrastructure and the associated construction cost and reimbursement amount applicable to each property 9 draft copies of the notice required in subsection b below to be sent to each property owner as a condition prior to the citys execution of a reimbursement agreement the initial developer shall supplement his application by submitting documentation acceptable to the development engineering director that provides as follows a final copies of the notice sent to each property owner b all infrastructure for which reimbursement of construction costs are requested fully conforms to the citys standards and specifications for the design and construction of public improvements c that the infrastructure has been granted initial acceptance by the city d that the initial developer has otherwise fully complied with all other city ordinances or regulations pertaining to the development of public improvements andor the initial developers property b notice the initial developer shall send by first class us mail a notice to each of the owners of each property that is situated within the proposed reimbursement area boundary together with a copy of the proposed reimbursement agreement and a copy of this city the notice shall state that any owner of affected property located within the city may file a written request with the city manager or designee thereof for an administrative hearing to object to the proposed reimbursement agreement the notice shall advise the property owners that the request for hearing shall include the following requirements 1 hearing request shall state in general terms the grounds of objection 2 hearing request must be filed within 15 days of the date of the receipt of the notice failure by any property owner to file a timely request within 15 days for a hearing constitutes a waiver by the owner of any right to such a hearing c administrative hearing upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing the city manager or designee thereof shall set a hearing date and notify the initial developer and all owners of affected property within the city of the date time and location of the hearing the city manager or designee thereof shall conduct an administrative hearing on the matter the burden of proof to establish that the request for reimbursement for construction cost is reasonable and necessary shall be on the initial developer if the initial developer establishes that the request for reimbursement is reasonable and necessary the burden of proof to establish disqualification for reimbursement shall shift to the property owner in the event multiple timely requests for hearing are submitted such hearings may be consolidated into one hearing at the discretion of the city manager or designee thereof prior to the city scheduling the hearing the initial developer shall pay to the city the citys estimated cost of conducting the hearing the initial developer shall remit such payment to the city within ten days from the date notification of the estimated cost is sent to the initial developer if the initial developer fails to remit the estimated hearing cost within the ten day timeframe the initial developer forfeits his right to argue the reasonableness of the reimbursement to the objecting property owner and that owners property will be exempt from the reimbursement agreement the initial developer will be required to remit to the city the difference between the actual hearing cost and the estimated hearing cost within ten days of notification by the city of the actual hearing cost the city will refund any overpayment should the actual hearing cost be less than the estimated hearing cost if the initial developer prevails and the proposed terms of the reimbursement agreement are substantially upheld as determined by the development engineering director the cost of the hearing will be added to the reimbursement amount for the property owner requesting the hearing following the hearing the city manager or designee thereof shall render a written decision and provide copies of the decision to all parties the decision is subject to judicial review pursuant to rule 106a4 of the colorado rules of civil procedure d administrative denial the city manager or designee thereof may without notice or hearing to any other property owner deny any reimbursement agreement application that does not fully comply with the requirements of this section the application may also be returned to the applicant for corrections if the city manager or designee thereof determines that to be an appropriate action e audit the city or its designated representative at the citys sole option may audit the records of the initial developer pertaining to construction cost at any reasonable time during normal business hours  102505 reimbursement agreement administration a no service without payment of reimbursement amounts no property will be permitted to connect to infrastructure constructed pursuant to this section or to any other part of the citys infrastructure until the obligations associated with such property under any reimbursement agreements have been paid in full b payment of estimated reimbursement amounts plus the collection fee by the connector to the city provided the initial developer has submitted sufficient documentation required by  6266a for a reimbursement agreement even though the reimbursement agreement is not yet executed the city will require connectors to make payment to the city in an amount estimated by the development engineering director to be the connectors obligation under any pending reimbursement agreement the amount paid by the connector will be adjusted to reflect the actual amount due under any such reimbursement agreement once the reimbursement agreement is executed the connector shall pay any additional monies due if the funds being held by the city prove to be less than the actual amount due the connector will receive a refund of any monies paid in excess of the actual amounts due once the reimbursement agreement is executed and the actual amount due is determined and collected from the connector the city will remit the reimbursement amount to the initial developer as required by this section in the event the initial developer does not receive a reimbursement agreement in accordance with these provisions the reimbursement amount held by the city less applicable administrative costs will then be returned to the connector c payment of reimbursement amounts plus the collection fee by the connector to the city connector shall pay the entire reimbursement amount as modified by the inflation factor plus the collection fee applicable to the entire property which is subject to a reimbursement agreement regardless of whether the property is subdivided payment shall be made upon execution of the developers agreement or at time of connection whichever occurs sooner however if prior to payment of the reimbursement amount and collection fee the property owner has subdivided the property and sold a portion or portions to other owners the connector shall be required to pay only their pro rata reimbursement amount and collection fee for their entire remaining property as determined by the development engineering director notwithstanding the foregoing payment by individual residential lots is not allowed unless the individual lot was existing and occupied but not connected to the infrastructure at the time the reimbursement agreement was executed refunds or credits of reimbursement amounts will not be made as a result of reducing the number of lots in a subdivision plat d reimbursement of collections to initial developer within 60 days of receipt of a reimbursement payment from a connector the city will remit the reimbursement to the initial developer  however the city will have the option to retain funds due any initial developer that is in arrears to the city or for noncompliance with city other agreements as determined by the development engineering director e notice of collection to initial developer the city will send the reimbursement amounts collected from connectors via us mail to the last known address of the initial developer it shall be the responsibility of the initial developer to notify the city of any change of address or business name if the reimbursement is returned as undeliverable to the city and if the city is unable to locate the initial developer by reasonable means the city will place a public notice regarding the collection of the reimbursement amount in a publication in general circulation in the county where the infrastructure subject to reimbursement is located for a period of two consecutive weeks the initial developer shall have 90 days following the publication of the second public notice to request in writing the proceeds of the collection and to notify the city of the initial developers current name and address if the initial developer fails to timely respond to the public notice the reimbursement payment less the collection fee will be returned to the connector except as provided in  6267h further the reimbursement agreement shall then become null and void from that point forward except for provisions in  6267d and  6267h and the city shall have no further obligation to the initial developer with regard to the reimbursement agreement f time limitation there shall be no collection of reimbursement payments by the city on or after the expiration of 15 years from the date of initial acceptance of the water wastewater or drainage infrastructure eligible for reimbursement there shall be no collections of reimbursement payments by the city on or after the expiration of ten years from the date of initial acceptance of the street infrastructure eligible for reimbursement connectors shall similarly have no obligation to make reimbursement payments on or after the expiration of said periods g no reservation of capacity the city will not reserve capacity in any infrastructure for any connector available capacity will be allocated based on a first come first served basis in the event the capacity of the infrastructure is fully allocated and one or more properties is not allowed to connect to the infrastructure covered under a reimbursement agreement then the property is relieved of the obligation to make reimbursement under the reimbursement agreement h in the event that final acceptance of any of the infrastructure is not obtained by the initial developer as required by the standards and specifications for the design and construction of public improvements or other city ordinances or codes as amended from time to time then the initial developers right to reimbursement shall terminate and the city may collect any reimbursement funds due from connectors and expend them to secure final acceptance any unexpended reimbursement funds shall be returned to the connectors on a proportionate basis as determined by the development engineering director in addition the reimbursement agreement shall be considered null and void  102505 conditions of reimbursement in the event that the city deems the application for a reimbursement agreement complete the city manager or designee thereof shall execute a reimbursement agreement with the initial developer for collection and payment of the reimbursable amount the following provisions shall be incorporated by reference into the reimbursement agreement 1 the city specifically will not guarantee collection of any portion of the reimbursable amount nothing in shall be deemed or construed to be a pledge of the citys faith and credit in facilitating the equitable apportionment of the construction cost of the infrastructure 2 it shall be the initial developers obligation to be aware of the citys publicly conducted development approval process and to timely apply for a reimbursement agreement notwithstanding the above the initial developer acknowledges that in the event he does not submit a complete and correct application for reimbursement agreement within 120 days of initial acceptance of the infrastructure or within 120 days of the adoption of this section whichever is later he will be forever barred from making such application and shall not be eligible for reimbursement 3 the initial developer shall defend and indemnify the city for and hold the city harmless from any suit claim or action that is or may be brought by any person against the city as a result of the reimbursement agreement entered into pursuant to this section in the event the city incurs costs as the result of any litigation or dispute in administering this agreement the initial developer shall reimburse the city for these costs within ten days of the city sending notification thereof in the event the initial developer fails to reimburse these costs upon written request by the city attorney the city will have no further obligations to the initial developer and any reimbursement agreements with the initial developer will be considered terminated notwithstanding the foregoing the city is not limited to these remedies 4 in the event a court invalidates the reimbursement agreement the city will have no further obligations to the initial developer and the reimbursement agreement with the initial developer will be considered terminated unless the court order provides otherwise if the initial developer has received reimbursement payments under a reimbursement agreement that a court invalidates then the initial developer shall return the reimbursement funds plus the applicable collection fee paid by the connector to the connector unless the court order provides otherwise in this event the city will not be obligated to refund the application fee to the initial developer or to refund the collection fee to either the initial developer or the connector 5 the agreement is personal to the initial developer and may not be assigned except upon written approval of the contract manager 6 the initial developer shall cooperate with the city in the implementation of the agreement including but not limited to providing such information as the city may deem necessary to perform its functions under the agreement 7 failure of the initial developer to comply with any of the material provisions of the reimbursement agreement shall constitute abandonment of all rights to reimbursement 8 limitations on reimbursement amounts a in no case will the initial developer be entitled to reimbursement in excess of the amount of the total construction cost as adjusted by the inflation factor less the construction cost required to provide capacity needed to serve the initial developers property upon the initial developer receiving reimbursement amounts totaling the amount of the construction cost as adjusted by the inflation factor less the construction cost of the capacity needed to serve the initial developers property no additional reimbursement amounts will be collected from future connectors b in the event the original reimbursement agreement area boundaries as described in the reimbursement agreement are altered by subsequent changes in topography the installation of unanticipated infrastructure or any other event which alters the provision of infrastructure from that which was anticipated at the time the initial developer constructed the infrastructure then the city shall so notify the initial developer in writing the initial developer shall not receive reimbursement from the areas so altered within the reimbursement agreement boundaries connectors shall not be required to reimburse the initial developer in such previously unanticipated instances of deletions or additions to the original reimbursement agreement boundaries all areas which remain within the original boundaries after such additions or deletions will be required to reimburse the initial developer as outlined in the reimbursement agreement except as noted in 2a or 62632b c adjustments as described above shall only be made in conjunction with the final plat for subsequent connectors properties no other adjustments will be allowed to reimbursement amounts or areas once a connection is made  102505 timing of developmenteligibility for reimbursement a

districts footnotes  1  cross reference administration ch 2  special assessments ch 62 article i  in general secs 6616625  reserved article ii  guidelines for sid gid or metro district creation purpose the general assembly has adopted legislation for the formation of special districts to eliminate overlapping of services provided by local government and to avoid double taxation resulting from duplication of services and facilities the city council is creating procedures to avoid having indebtedness of special districts affect the credit rating of the city and preserve the financial integrity of the city and its citizens the city council declares its desire to prevent the shifting of development risk to nondevelopers and to attempt to minimize excessive tax burdens upon city residents in special districts as well as not allow the costs of any special district to be shifted to citizens who are not within the geographic boundaries of a special district or receiving benefit from it the city council has determined to establish policy guidelines relating to the creation of separate districts within the citys boundaries for the purpose of financing the construction of certain public improvements the guidelines contained in this article are general in nature may be considered by the council among such other information as the council deems appropriate and shall vest no right in any individual or entity relating to the creation of a special improvement district general improvement district or metropolitan district subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives the adoption of this chapter is necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and is provided for under the home rule powers granted by the constitution of the state a1     71400 definitions the types of districts covered by this article are defined as follows and include only those districts created subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives general improvement district gid means a district organized under crs  3125601 et seq as a separate political subdivision of the state special improvement district sid means a district specifically authorized by of the charter and pursuant to of the charter the procedure implementing such authority has been set forth in a procedural

than using a payasyougo cash funding capital projects fund  b incurrence of debt or revenue obligations by the city issuance of general obligation bonds utilities revenue bonds or sales tax revenue bonds  c tax increment financing tda  or d longterm lease financings the creation of a nonprofit building authority or any other available financing mechanism 2 the threshold criteria pursuant to which the city may review each proposal for the creation of a district and evaluate the benefits which will accrue to the city or the affected properties a within the project area of the tda as established on  in the thornton community improvement plan as amended from time to time the project area of the tda  b within the citys boundaries but outside the boundaries of the project area of the tda  or c within the citys extended planning area as designated in the citys adopted comprehensive plan 3 the unique characteristics of each type of district and the situations where each may offer the most appropriate and efficient financing vehicle absent other considerations which the council may determine to take into account a3   policy goals objectives and considerations a policy goals the citys goal is to be prepared to use the most appropriate financing alternative for the construction of public improvements designed to serve redevelopment projects new commercial and industrial developments and residential developments within the citys boundaries or service areas in addition establishment of these policy guidelines will facilitate compliance with the citys comprehensive plan the utilities master plan thoroughfare master plan drainage master plans the thornton community improvement plan and the capital improvements plan as well as the coordination of planned development within the citys extended planning area and additional growth areas through the creation of an sid gid or metro district potentially the city could achieve two goals 1 constructing certain public improvements with noncity funds and localizing the financing burden therefor 2 in some circumstances assisting the private sector as well by cooperating in projects beneficial to both public and private entities b policy objectives as set forth in this subsection the city may consider the creation of an sid gid or metro district when in the sole discretion of the council the formation of a district is in the citys best interest and in the best interest of the area to be served circumstances which may indicate that a district may be an appropriate financing alternative within the citys boundaries or within the extended service area include 1 where the public improvements to be constructed provide a general benefit to all or a portion of city residents and have previously been established as a portion of a systemwide municipal project as set forth in the citys comprehensive plan thoroughfare master plan drainage master plans utilities master plan capital improvements plan the thornton community improvement plan or any other public facility document that the city may adopt but where construction financing has not been budgeted in a given current year in the citys capital projects fund such projects could include interchanges to interstate highways or highways operated by a public highway authority and major open space or natural features as identified in the parks and open space master plan 2 where the public improvements will serve commercial or industrial redevelopment projects or new developments which will enlarge materially the citys tax base 3 where the public improvements will serve commercial industrial or residential development which will enhance the entire community with a special emphasis on the quality of the proposed development or redevelopment project 4 where the financing burden would be imposed primarily on those properties specially benefited 5 with respect to public improvements which pursuant to the citys thencurrent development policies and applicable ordinances are the obligation of the adjacent surrounding or nearby properties where the public improvements are disproportionately large and financially burdensome in comparison to the benefit received by the affected properties 6 where the council makes a determination in its sole discretion that creation of a district is necessary or desirable for reasons of economies of scale construction timing coordination with other public improvements or the preservation of the health safety and general welfare of the citys citizens c objectives for public improvements within project area of tda 1 the city may review proposals for district creation in the circumstances set forth in subsection b of this section among other circumstances and in accordance with the review considerations established in subsection d of this section among other considerations  provided however that as an overriding policy consideration the city may choose to consider most favorably districts proposed in connection with development or redevelopment projects located within the boundaries of the project area of the tda if the proponents for the proposed district can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city council that the public improvements to be financed district will further encourage and enhance development or redevelopment within the boundaries of the project area of the tda the city may choose to consider more extensive assistance financing mechanism afforded by the proposed district or by any other means available and deemed appropriate by the council by way of example but not determinative as a matter of policy the city may include but not be limited to the types of public improvements to be financed within the boundaries of the project area of the tda as follows a collector streets in addition to arterial streets b detention or retention facilities in addition to distribution water mains and sewer collection and outfall lines c landscape improvements within the public rightofway and open spaces storm sewers or traffic signalization improvements in addition to major offsite improvements 2 it will remain entirely within the councils discretion to determine the types of public improvements which are warranted for districts created within or without the boundaries of the project area of the tda d review considerations in conjunction with of relating to sids of this chapter relating to metro districts and any future procedural ordinance which the city council may adopt relating to gids those districts which include the following provisions as part of their organizational proceedings or with respect to sids appropriate assurances contained in collateral documents may be more favorably considered 1 a report from the city manager that the proponents for the proposed district have submitted all necessary information as required by the citys respective procedural document and that the city staff has made a recommendation on the formation of the proposed district 2 a provision that all improvements constructed by the district will be subject to inspection by the city in such form and fashion as necessary to ensure compliance with the citys approval of applicable plans and permits 3 exclusive of sids and unless otherwise provided for and specifically approved by the city or state or public highway authority a provision that all facilities constructed by the district would be conveyed to the city or other entity free and clear of any lien claim encumbrance or demand subject to the citys normal warranty procedures 4 exclusive of sids a prohibition against the provision of any ongoing services and operations or maintenance of facilities unless the council specifically approves the districts proposal to provide continuing services 5 an assurance that adequate written notice and disclosure will be provided to the initial and subsequent purchasers and users of the properties within the district regarding the existence operations and additional taxes charges or assessments which will be imposed in connection with the district 6 to the extent possible provisions designed to minimize the financial impact upon the purchasers and users of the properties within the district and minimize the risk of bond defaults 7 exclusive of sids a provision that the district once created is subject to the citys zoning subdivision building other land use requirements a4     71400 application the following may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the use of each type of district under this article 1 sids may be most favorably considered in situations where the goal is initial construction of the public improvements ie upon completion the improvements will become part of the citywide system to be operated and maintained by the city other factors conducive to the approval of sids may include a requests for the creation of an sid from a substantial number of property owners willing to pay assessments for the benefit conferred b properties in an undeveloped area or in a developing or redeveloping mode c properties with fragmented ownerships along the public rightofway d public improvements which will provide a benefit to the property commensurate with the cost thereof e properties which will not be subdivided into multiple parcels f properties with a foreclosure sale value sufficient to support the assessment liens imposed g public improvements which require cooperative financing between the city and private individuals or entities where the citys contribution has been budgeted in the capital project funds h public improvements located within the project area of the tda because sids are unaffected by the frozen assessed valuation level imposed by the tda 2 gids may be most favorably considered in situations where the city requires a financing mechanism for the continued operation and maintenance of improvements separate and apart from the citys general fund or utilities operations funds a other factors conducive to the approval of gids include 1 an area where the city considers it necessary to maintain complete control  the city council sits ex officio as the gids board of directors 2 a situation where the gids broad condemnation powers would be beneficial 3 properties in an area which may be overlapped in the future by a larger title 32 special district b under limited circumstances the council may determine to permit the creation of a gid which would use general obligation debt as a financing mechanism with a property tax levy as security therefor within the boundaries of the project area of the tda such debt financing must be specifically authorized by an intergovernmental agreement among the gid the city and the tda 3 the city may choose to consider such metro districts in the following situations a where the proponents can demonstrate that there is a necessity for the independent control exercised by the metro districts board of directors  by way of example but not determinative of policy where the viability of the metro districts financing plan is dependent upon the directors authority and ability to impose rates fees and charges as necessary to meet payments on its revenue or general obligations issued to finance the public improvements  b where the proponents can demonstrate that the districts independent authority to control the construction of improvements will inure to the benefit of the city  or c an area where the creation of a larger metro district is not anticipated to be used as a financing vehicle for major areawide public improvements a5     82498   71400 implementation separate procedural documents have been approved and may be approved implementing the procedure
