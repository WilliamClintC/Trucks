protect the base flow of the townships surface waters these regulations shall be applied in conjunction with those provided for in other sections of this ordinance dealing with groundwater conservation and replenishment a the proposed subdivision and land development of any tract shall be designed to cause the least practicable disturbance to natural infiltration and percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table planning of vegetation and land disturbance activities and the placement of streets buildings and other impervious surfaces in locations other than those identified on the existing resources and site analysis plan as having the greatest permeability where precipitation is most likely to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater b all new development or expansion of existing development in west sadsbury township shall attempt to provide a nonnegative hydrologic balance preand postdevelopment any reduction in the groundwater recharge resulting from the construction of new impervious surfaces alteration of grading and drainage loss of vegetation construction of sanitary and storm sewers andor modification from any other predevelopment condition

recharge system shall utilize design and engineering standards and techniques approved by the supervisors upon recommendations after review by the township engineer c predevelopment and postdevelopment water balance calculations must be made to determine the resultant impact on groundwater resources typically the impact of changed site conditions must be estimated by using average rainfall total disturbance acreage and appropriate soil cover factors as applied in the cover complex method developed bythe soilconservation service or another method acceptable to the township engineer this calculation will provide an estimate of increased stormwater runoff resulting from development and therefore the net reduction in groundwater recharge the estimate shall be developed on an average annual basis in inches and gallons if groundwater withdrawals are being undertaken for water supply or other purposes this quantity also must be considered as a debit for the groundwater system the difference between the predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions equals the total debit which must be balanced to stormwater management techniques or to wastewater effluent application which mitigate the total loss of groundwater recharge where possible 3 stream valleys swales springs and other lowland areas thetownships open space recreation and environmental resources plan describes and maps stream valleys which include stream channels and flood plains swales springs and other lowland areas as resources that warrant restrictive land use controls because of flooding hazards to human life and property their ground water recharge functions their importance to water quality and the health of aquatic communities and their wildlife habitats they are generally poorly suited for onsite subsurface sewage disposal systems a the following activities shall be minimized 1 disturbance to streams and drainage swales 2 disturbance to yearround wetlands areas with seasonally high water tables and areas of surface water concentration 3 because of their extreme limitations stream valleys swales and other lowland areas warrant designation as open space lands they may also require adjoining buffer lands to be included in the open space to be determined by an analysis of the protection requirements of such areas on a casebycase basis in certain instances seasonal high water table soils may be excluded from the open space where it can be demonstrated that they are suitable for low density residential uses and conventional onsite sewage systems 4 woodlands woodlands are found throughout the township often in association with stream valleys and wet areas poor and erodible agricultural soils and moderate to steep slopes a woodland conditions within west sadsbury township vary with respect to species composition age stocking and health they range from relatively recent postagricultural young stands to mature mixedage forests most woodlands in the township represent one or more of the following resource values 1 as soil stabilizers particularly on moderate to steep slopes thereby controlling erosion into nearby streams ponds impoundments and roads a closely related function is their enhancement of ground water recharge 2 as a means of ameliorating harsh microclimatic conditions in both summer and winter 3 as a source of wood products ie poles sawtimber veneer and firewood 4 as habitats for woodland birds mammals and other wildlife 5 as recreation resources for walkers equestrians picnickers and other related outdoor activities 6

for proposed sewage disposal systems shall be permitted on a site before the completion of subdivision and land development agreements the determination of sight distance clearances along roadways shall be made graphically and not by clearing onsite prior to final plan approval 5 upland ruralagricultural areas these areas comprise fields pastures meadows and former agricultural areas in early stages of woodlands succession with fences stone walls and hedgerows typically bordered by stream valleys and upland woodlands these comprise the townships historic working landscape dotted with historic houses barns and other structures and give west sadsbury township much of its rural character they also contain the greatest concentration of prime agricultural soils because of their openness and high visibility development in these areas is likely to be most readily seen and disruptive to the historic landscape they sometimes provide habitat for wildlife in conjunction with nearby woodlands and stream valleys however it is recognized that these areas also frequently offer the fewest constraints for development a several elements of these working landscapes lend themselves to incorporation into the townships open space network these include prime agricultural soils and natural features which visually punctuate the landscape such as hedgerows tree copses stone walls and visually prominent places such as knolls and hilltops b these areas can also accommodate development with preferred locations being the nonprime agricultural soils and lower topographic settings where development will be visually less obtrusive compact clustered residential designs with coordinated architectural and landscape architectural themes are encouraged in highly visible locations where future development cannot be avoided such as at the far edge of open fields 6 slopes moderately steep sloping lands fifteen percent to twentyfive percent 15% to 25% and steeply sloping lands over 25% are prone to severe erosion if disturbed erosion and the resulting overland flow of soil sediments into streams ponds and public roads are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life and a potential hazard to public safety a areas of steep slope shall be preserved in accordance with the zoning as required below b all grading and earthmoving on slopes exceeding fifteen percent 15% shall be minimized c no site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding twentyfive percent 25% except grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single family dwelling when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding twentyfive percent 25% is feasible d on slopes of fifteen percent to twentyfive percent 15% to 25% the only permitted grading beyond the terms described above shall be in conjunction with the siting of a single family dwelling its access driveway and the septic system which should typically be designed with a long narrow drainage field following the land contours e grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of fifteen percent 15% or greater shall not result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six feet except where in the judgment of the board no reasonable alternatives exist for construction of roads drainage structures and other public improvements in which case such vertical dimensions shall not exceed twelve 12 feet roads and driveways shall follow the line of existing topography to minimize the required cut and fill finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall be as required to minimize disturbance of natural grades 7 significant natural areas and features natural areas containing rare or endangered plants and animals as well as other features of natural significance exist throughout

design relocating proposed lot lines providing landscape buffers or other approved means c municipal participation review and approval of the applicants interaction with the pennsylvania historical and museum commission with regard to the preservation of historic resources as required for dep approval of proposed sewage disposal systems shall be required prior to final plan approval 9 scenic roads and scenic vistas the townships open space recreation and environmental resources plan identifies a number of scenic roads in various parts of the municipality all applications for subdivision and land development shall attempt to preserve the scenic visual corridors along such roads by incorporating them into open space areas or otherwise providing for building setbacks and architectural designs to minimize their intrusion in instances where such designs fail to satisfactorily protect corridors applicants will be required to provide naturalistic landscape buffers to minimize their adverse visual impacts the species specified for such buffers shall be selected on the basis of an inventory of tree and shrub species found in existing hedgerows and along wooded roadside edges in the vicinity of the development proposal 10 trails when a subdivision or land development proposal is traversed by or abuts an existing trail customarily used by pedestrians andor equestrians the board may require the applicant to make provisions for continued recreational use of the trail a the applicant may alter the course of the trail within the tract for which development is proposed under the following conditions 1 the points at which the trail enters and exits the tract remain unchanged 2 the proposed alteration exhibits quality trail design according to generally accepted

difficult part 7 modification andor waiver of requirements and standards 701 roads standards for roads included in this are intended to provide for safe and intelligent layout of streets which can be easily maintained there are several aspects which may lead to varying the size or design of specific streets 1 road width a where a street is designed as a minor residential street and overflow parking is provided a reduction in width may be permitted b where a street is utilized for residential parking an increase in width will be required 2 rightofway width rightofway width is intended to provide enough land for roads sidewalks or other utilities secondly it is intended to provide an additional buffer between homes and streets where sidewalks are not constructed along streets cartway widths may be reduced where utilities are located outside of the rightofway or where houses do not front on the street a reduction in the width of the rightofway may be permitted 3 curbs curbs are used to channel water to storm water systems and to keep cars in the cartway in lowintensity developments natural drainage should be encouraged the soils and topography will be considered swales should be saucershaped in profile and seeded to prevent erosion 4 design speed in the case of local streets the board may allow a design speed less than thirty 30 miles per hour provided the street will be posted with a maximum speed limit no greater than the design speed horizontal and vertical alignment of the street shall correspond to aashto standards for the permitted design speed 702 sidewalks sidewalks are intended to provide a safe means of movement for pedestrians modern design practice encourages placing sidewalks away from streets in doing so the function of sidewalks must be

management this be inserted as of the ordinances of west sadsbury township entitled stormwater management statement of findings the governing body of west sadsbury township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems costeffective and environmentally sensitive stormwater west sadsbury township stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces reduce disturbance of land and natural resources avoid sensitive areas ie riparian buffers floodplains steep slopes wetlands etc and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater g federal and state regulations require the municipality to implement a program of stormwater controls the municipality is required to obtain a permit and comply with its provisions for stormwater discharges from its separate storm sewer system under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes h nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth purpose the purpose of this to protect public health safety and general welfare property and water quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management practices criteria and provisions included herein for land development construction and earth disturbance activities to achieve the following throughout the municipality a reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting people property infrastructure and public services b sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of groundwater and surface waters c protect natural resources including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats d maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and their receiving watersheds e minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features drainage patterns infiltration and flow conditions within land development site designs f reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated and manage and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible g provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to protect groundwater supplies and stream baseflows prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources west sadsbury township stormwater h reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the chemical physical and biological quality of ground and surface waters i reduce scour erosion and sedimentation of stream channels j reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying capacity of streams and their floodplains k protect adjacent and downgradient lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater discharges l minimize impervious surfaces and connected impervious surfaces to promote infiltration and reduce the volume and impacts

terms used in the manual 3 iv determining what type of stormwater management submission is needed 4 v using the stormwater management worksheets 6 vi minor stormwater site plan requirements 7 vii selecting stormwater bmps 9 viii stormwater management worksheets 9 ix stormwater management bmp facilities & maintenance agreement 9 3 i introduction this design manual has been created as a tool to help property owners manage stormwater on their property and streamline the process of designing onsite stormwater management facilities for regulated activities that are new relatively minor residential and accessory structure projects less than 2000 square feet through the use of this manual residents have the ability to determine the appropriate facilities for their property project and budget this design method is not intended to be used with largescale subdivision  land development projects or activities that include infrastructure such as roadways the stormwater best management practices stormwater bmps listed in this manual should be used as a guide and are not a comprehensive list of options residents should contact west sadsbury township to discuss alternative solutions for site specific applications ii importance of stormwater management stormwater is the runoff produced by precipitation snow melt or ice melt when land is developed or changed the flow patterns of water volume of water and quality of water are also changed land development activities can affect characteristics of stormwater runoff including the rate of runoff volume of runoff and quality of runoff when runoff is not managed the increased volume may aggravate flooding the objective of stormwater management is to prevent or mitigate the adverse impacts of the increase in rate and volume of stormwater runoff while also protecting health safety and property stormwater bmps aim to maintain water quality encourage infiltration in appropriate areas promote groundwater recharge maintain the natural drainage characteristics of the site to the maximum extent practicable and protect stream banks and beds iii standard terms used in the manual bmp best management practice  activities facilities designs measures or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from regulated activities to provide water quality treatment infiltration volume reduction andor peak rate control to promote groundwater recharge and to otherwise meet the purposes of this bmps are commonly grouped into one 1 of two 2 broad categories or measures structural or nonstructural in this nonstructural bmps or measures refer to operational andor behaviorrelated practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural bmps or measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff structural bmps include but are not limited to a wide variety of practices and devices from largescale retention ponds and constructed wetlands to smallscale underground treatment systems infiltration facilities filter strips low impact design bioretention wet ponds permeable paving grassed swales riparian or forested buffers sand filters detention basins and manufactured devices structural stormwater bmps are permanent appurtenances to the site 4 disturbed area  land area disturbed by or where an earth disturbance activity is occurring or has occurred earth disturbance or earth disturbance activity  a construction or other human activity which disturbs the surface of the land including but not limited to clearing and grubbing  grading  excavations  embankments  road maintenance  land development  building construction  and the moving depositing stockpiling or storing of soil rock or earth materials flow path  the path that stormwater follows from the discharge point to the nearest property line or channelized flow ie stream drainage ditch etc the length of the path is measured along the ground slope impervious surface or impervious area  a surface that has been compacted or covered with a layer of material so that it prevents or is resistant to infiltration of water including but not limited to structures such as roofs buildings storage sheds  other solid paved or concrete areas such as streets driveways sidewalks parking lots patios swimming pools tennis or other paved courts  or athletic playfields comprised of synthetic turf materials for the purposes of determining compliance with this compacted soils or stone surfaces used for vehicle parking and movement shall be considered impervious surfaces that were designed to allow infiltration ie areas of porous pavement will be considered on a casebycase basis by the municipal engineer based on appropriate documentation and condition of the material etc karst  a type of topography that is formed over limestone or other carbonate rock formations by dissolving or solution of the rock by water and that is characterized by closed depressions sinkholes caves a subsurface network of solution conduits and fissures groundwater moves and no perennial surface drainage features minor stormwater site plan  a site plan prepared and submitted for regulated activities which meet the small project and minor stormwater site plan criteria the plan depicts existing conditions on the property proposed impervious areas and if required the location of proposed stormwater bmps regulated activities  any earth disturbance activityies or any activity that involves the alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect stormwater runoff runoff  any part of precipitation that flows over the land surface small project  regulated activities that involve less than two thousand 2000 square feet of proposed impervious surfaces and less than ten thousand 10000 square feet of proposed earth disturbance are eligible to apply the modified requirements presented in this manual simplified approach to stormwater management for small projects provided that there are not known site or local conditions that may preclude the use of any techniques included in the simplified approach 5 iv determining what type of stormwater management submission is needed the following chart provides a guide to determine what type of stormwater submission is needed some projects will be eligible for an exemption from preparing a stormwater management plan but documentation of the project must still be filed with west sadsbury township completion of the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheets will determine what type of documentation is required for each project this manual is designed to assist those with regulated activities that qualify for the use of a minor stormwater site plan if a swm site plan is required in accordance with the west sadsbury township stormwater management please consult a qualified professional ex engineer surveyor note regulated activities must meet both proposed new impervious area and proposed earth disturbance requirements to be eligible for an exemption or a small project the applicant should first review the planned project with west sadsbury township to confirm the following  that the proposed project is not otherwise exempt from the stormwater management control and the engineered stormwater management site plan requirements of the municipalitys stormwater management    that the proposed project is eligible to follow the small projectminor stormwater site plan requirements   to determine which components of the proposed project must be included in the calculation of impervious surfaces areas  and  whether any local conditions are known to the municipality that would preclude the use of any of the techniques included in this simplified approach the following shall be submitted to west sadsbury township depending on the proposed project  eligible for exemption o stormwater management worksheet stormwater management proposed new impervious area proposed earth disturbance area next steps eligible for exemption less than 1000 feet  less than 5000 feet  file stormwater management worksheet small project 1000 feet  to   2000 feet  5000 feet  to   10000 feet  prepare a minor stormwater site plan nonexempt greater than 2000 feet  greater than 10000 feet  prepare a swm site plan per  small project o stormwater management worksheet o owner acknowledgement signed o minor stormwater site plan o signed and notarized stormwater best management practices operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement following approval and signature by the municipality the landowner must have the agreement recorded at the chester county office of the recorder of deeds so that the agreement will be applicable to future landowners  nonexempt o swm site plan and associated calculations prepared by a professional engineer landscape architect or surveyor v using the stormwater management worksheets determining the new impervious area of a proposed project is the first step in using this simplified approach completing the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheets will assist the property owner or applicant and west sadsbury township in determining the impervious area of a proposed project and providing guidance steps stormwater management worksheets can be obtained from the west sadsbury township municipal office step 1 step 1 of the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheet provides a table and directions on how to calculate the new impervious area proposed to be created if the total new impervious area is less than 1000 square feet the project may be exempt from the volume rate and swm site plan requirements of the west sadsbury township stormwater management completing step 1 of the worksheet the applicant will sign the acknowledgement at the top of the sheet and file it with west sadsbury township west sadsbury township will use this as a record of exempt projects and keep a running total of proposed impervious area since the adoption of the west sadsbury township stormwater management exceeding 1000 square feet of impervious area since the adoption of the west sadsbury township stormwater management a property owner will need to prepare a minor stormwater site plan or a stormwater management site plan in accordance with however applicants shall note that regulated activities that meet the exemption criteria may be required to manage stormwater runoff and provide plans andor calculations as required in this ordinance should west sadsbury township determine that there is a potential for stormwater runoff associated with the proposed regulated activity to adversely affect adjacent or downstream public or private properties 7 if the total new impervious area is 1000 square feet or greater and less than 2000 square feet the applicant will go on to step 2 if the regulated activity involves only earth disturbance between 5000 square feet to less than 10000 square feet the applicant shall contact west sadsbury township for additional guidance step 2 step 2 of the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheet provides guidance to calculate the total volume of stormwater runoff from new impervious surfaces that must be controlled using stormwater bmps upon completion of these calculations continue to step 3 step 3 step 3 of the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheet provides guidance regarding the preparation of a minor stormwater site plan as outlined in this design manual for approval by west sadsbury township this includes determining the types sizes and location of proposed stormwater bmps to be employed for a given project the worksheets minor stormwater site plan and owner acknowledgement will be submitted to west sadsbury township for approval west sadsbury township will use this submission as a record to keep a running total of proposed impervious area since the adoption of the west sadsbury township stormwater management to monitor the installation of the required stormwater bmps necessary to support the project vi minor stormwater site plan requirements a minor stormwater site plan depicts the existing conditions of a property and the location of proposed impervious surfaces depicting the relationship between the regulated activities and distances to things like property lines streams and vegetated areas will help determine if the stormwater runoff created by the proposed project can be managed naturally within the property or if additional stormwater bmps are needed to accommodate the stormwater runoff if a project requires the submission of a minor stormwater site plan or a plan in support of an exemption the applicant shall prepare and submit to west sadsbury township a minor stormwater site plan and the west sadsbury township stormwater management worksheet the chester county gis office can provide assistance to applicants to obtain property maps of existing features a minor stormwater site plan depicting the key features of the site must be drawn to scale and show the following  property owner name address email and phone number  property address if different from owner address  tax parcel id number  name address phone number & email address of plan preparer  property boundary  site conditions grassed areas agricultural fields direction of slope and stormwater flow on the property  location of all existing and proposed structures house driveway shed addition etc and any existing and proposed downspouts include the dimensions of proposed structures 8  distance from proposed downspouts to property line  all existing and proposed driveways and other impervious areas stone and gravel driveways are considered impervious  natural features such as streams wetlands floodplains tree lines and other vegetation on the property and within 50 feet of the property line  distance from proposed structures or downspouts along the stormwater flow path to any stream or wooded area  any other pertinent information that may be significant to the project site existing drainage ways steep slopes exposed bedrock upslope drainage areas etc  wells and onsite sanitary sewer systems septic tank drainfield etc  surface and subsurface utilities  existing and proposed easements gas electric stormwater water sewer etc if stormwater bmps are required the following information must also be shown on the plan  location and size of proposed stormwater bmps  details of bmps as necessary for construction other considerations for minor stormwater management plans  for minor stormwater management plans soil testing is highly recommended to select and apply the appropriate stormwater bmps the use of soil maps infiltration tests and or perc tests may provide the applicant basic information about soil characteristics  proposed stormwater management facilities must be designed to handle flows from the contributing area  the site shall not have any preexisting stormwater drainagerelated problems as verified by west sadsbury township at the discretion of west sadsbury township  water quality shall be protected per of pa  west sadsbury township may inspect all stormwater bmps during and after construction  installation  infiltration bmps should not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire contributory drainage area has achieved final stabilization  ensure that infiltration in geologically susceptible areas such as but not limited to carbonate geology  karst topography do not cause adverse effects the minor stormwater site plan should incorporate steps to ensure that salt or chloride will not contaminate the groundwater  selected stormwater bmps shall be designed constructed and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers recommendation the pa stormwater management bmp manual or other written guidance acceptable to west sadsbury township  proposed sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or vegetative stormwater bmps to the maximum extent practicable and not adversely impact adjacent and downstream properties 9 vii selecting stormwater bmps if the submission of a minor stormwater management plan including the use of stormwater bmps is required the applicant should review the compiled information in the pa stormwater management bmp manual this document identifies stormwater bmps that have been deemed to be of a nature and cost that will accomplish the goals of the chester county stormwater management plan while not unduly burdening the residents it will then be the owners responsibility to select a facility determine the appropriate size and agree to construct and maintain that facility or facilities the property owner is encouraged to utilize both multiple and hybrid versions of the facilities as outlined in the documents mentioned above the applicant may choose to install a stormwater bmp facility as shown in the stormwater management worksheets the stormwater bmp facility shall be constructed in accordance with the associated construction details requirements and notes viii stormwater management worksheets stormwater management worksheets can be obtained from the west sadsbury township municipal office ix stormwater managementbmp facilities and maintenance agreement it is the landowners responsibility to properly maintain bmps it is also the landowners responsibility to inform any future buyers of the function operation and maintenance needed for any bmps on the property prior to the purchase of the property the maintenance agreement outlines the inspection and maintenance required for each type of bmp the responsibilities of the landowner and the rights of the municipality in regards to inspection and enforcement of the maintenance requirements the operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement must be signed notarized and submitted to the municipality following approval and signature by the municipality the landowner must have the agreement recorded at the chester county office of the recorder of deeds so that the agreement will be applicable to future landowners the operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement can be obtained from the west sadsbury township municipal office ordinance appendix b site design process 1 natural hydrology site design process introduction identifies a natural hydrology site design process that strives to minimize disturbances to land site hydrology and natural resources and maintain the natural hydrologic regime drainage patterns and flow conditions of a site to the maximum extent practicable this appendix is intended to build on that process by providing additional information for achieving site designs that best maintain preconstruction stormwater runoff conditions protect site amenities and preserve natural resources this appendix describes the following components of the natural hydrology site design process  design principles and techniques   design process   design practices  and  references some common drainage design approaches for land development radically alter natural hydrologic conditions by constructing collection and conveyance systems that are designed to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach has often led to the degradation of water quality reduced groundwater recharge and increased volumes of runoff as well as the expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing increased volumes of concentrated runoff at some downstream location the natural hydrology site design process encourages land development site designs that minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes and that minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities this process strives to incorporate the desired land development into the natural hydrologic landscape in a manner that maintains and utilizes existing site hydrology features and functions to minimize generation of new stormwater this avoids cumulative environmental impacts often associated with land development and reducing the need for and size of constructed stormwater facilities this approach minimizes the disturbance of land area natural features and site hydrology  preserves significant concentrations of open space woodlands and corridors of environmentally sensitive features  and incorporates landscapebased bmps and low impact development techniques to minimize the utilization of more intrusive structural stormwater facilities with this design process the primary goals of a land development project can be achieved while minimizing the negative environmental impacts and avoiding management costs associated with unnecessary stormwater runoff the fundamental principle of this design process is that site hydrology features are considered up front in the land development design process and are prioritized as integral aspects to be maintained and utilized within the site design rather than being first sacrificed for space needed for traditional site layout or for construction of more intrusive stormwater facilities 2 natural hydrology site design is not a new approach but rather a holistic process that combines certain principles of low impact development conservation design and sustainable design and focuses on reducing unnecessary alterations to the natural patterns and functions of existing onsite hydrologic features these natural hydrologic features tend to perform their hydrologic function ie infiltration evapotranspiration flow attenuation pollutant removal etc very efficiently and sometimes have the hydrologic capacity to perform that function on increased runoff loadings from the built environment however care must be taken to adequately characterize the capacity of their hydrologic function and avoid overwhelming the feature with excessive runoff loadings thus causing unintended impairments that are completely counterproductive to the purpose of natural hydrology site design preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design considerations natural hydrology site design should serve as the foundation of the overall site design approach and when applied in conjunction with the design professionals overall land development goals and desired outcomes can help shape the overall vision and conceptual layout of the land development project site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage applying this site design process helps maintain site hydrology and manage stormwater by minimizing the generation of stormwater runoff achieved by designing to the land considering site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics reducing grading and compaction and considering scale and placement of buildings  managing stormwater as close to the point of generation as possible by disconnecting impervious surfaces and distributing storm flows to landscapedbased bmps  providing open and vegetated channel conveyance as needed to treat water quality reduce velocity and infiltrate  and managing remaining conveyed stormwater in common open space as needed to disperse low velocity storm flows treat water quality infiltrate and release a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features design principles and techniques natural hydrology site design involves identifying and prioritizing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features and incorporating such features into the overall site design to take advantage of their efficiencies of hydrologic performance their cost efficiencies of reducing the need for or size of constructed stormwater facilities and their aesthetic amenities the five design principles to be achieved by this approach are as follows  minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural 3 hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site techniques to be applied to achieve the design principles are presented in table b1 design process the first step in applying natural hydrology site design is to identify delineate and assess the functions of all existing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features that are located within the project site  will receive discharge from the project site  or may be impacted by runoff or disturbance from the proposed land development project this includes  streams waterways springs wetlands vernal pools and water bodies   drainage patterns conveyances and discharge points   natural infiltration areas and patterns   areas of natural vegetation that provide significant evapotranspiration pollutant removal bank stabilization flow attenuation or riparian buffer functions   floodplains  and  other features that contribute to the overall hydrologic function and value of the site and its receiving streams once this inventory and assessment are completed these identified resources and features are then prioritized for their ability to provide hydrologic function and performance for managing runoff from the proposed site improvements specifically they should be prioritized as follows  those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides for their protection from any disturbance or impact from the proposed land development   those to be protected from further disturbance or impact and for which the proposed land development will provide improvement to existing conditions   those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their hydrologic function eg for infiltration evapotranspiration or reducing pollutant loads runoff volume or peak discharge rates etc to reduce the need for or size of constructed bmps  and  those that may be considered for alteration disturbance or removal these prioritizations are then applied as the basis on which to begin the site design layout grading construction and permanent ground cover designs to achieve the five 5 design principles outlined above the following section describes just a few of the many design practices methods and techniques that are available to achieve the landowners desired land development goals and the desired environmental efficiencies intended by natural hydrology site design 4 table b1  site design process principles and techniques design principles design techniques minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  maintain the natural soil structure and vegetative cover that are often critical components of maintaining the hydrologic functions of natural infiltration bioretention flow attenuation evapotranspiration and pollutant removal  protect or improve natural resources to reduce the needs for environmental mitigation future environmental restoration and cumulative flow and water quality impacts of unnecessary disturbances within the watershed system  minimize the disturbance of natural surface and groundwater drainage features and patterns discharge points and flow characteristics natural infiltration and evapotranspiration patterns and characteristics natural stream channel stability and floodplain conveyance etc minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces  separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components  disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another  avoid unnecessary impervious surfaces  utilize porous materials where suited in lieu of impervious materials designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  prioritize onsite hydrologic features ie for protection improvement utilization or alteration and natural site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics and consider them for the cornerstones of the conceptual site design  reduce grading and compaction by applying selective grading design methods to provide final grading patterns tthat preserve existing topography where it most benefits natural hydrologic functions and where needed  this results in graded areas that evenly distribute runoff and minimize concentrated runoff flows  consider the scale and placement of buildings and other infrastructure to minimize impact to natural hydrologic features  incorporate unique natural scenic and historic site features into the configuration of the development and ensure flexibility in development design to meet community needs for complimentary and aesthetically pleasing development such as can be achieved design and sustainable design approaches 5 design principles design techniques design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  incorporate natural hydrologic features that have been selected for their available capacity and function into the overall system of site runoff controls  incorporate low impact development or similar bmps and distribute storm flows to o reduce runoff  o manage stormwater at or as close to the point of generation as possible  o disconnect discharges from streets and municipal storm sewer systems  and o select and design bmps to give first priority to nonstructural and vegetation landscapebased bmps second priority to surface structural bmps third priority to subsurface structural bmps and design subsurface bmps as shallow as possible  provide open channel conveyance as needed to o treat water quality  o reduce runoff velocity  and o promote infiltration and evapotranspiration of runoff  manage remaining conveyed stormwater from small storms in common open space areas to achieve multiple objectives o disperse storm flows and reduce velocity  o treat water quality  and o promote infiltrate and evapotranspiration of runoff  provide for appropriate conveyance to retention or detention storage facilities as needed for flows from large storm events  maintain open space functions consistent with common area uses passive recreation onsite sewage management scenic vistas etc refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site apply site design techniques and practices as appropriate based on  conservation design principles and practices  sustainable design principles and practices  low impact development design principles and practices 6 design practices numerous practices and strategies can be considered where their aim is to sustain and utilize the benefits of existing site hydrology and minimize the generation of new stormwater runoff following are brief descriptions of various practices that can be used to achieve the principles of the natural hydrology site design process site layout practices the following site layout practices are but a few of the methods by which the natural hydrology site design process described above can be implemented such practices are less functions of regimented codes and procedures than about understanding and recognizing the benefits and values that existing resources can contribute to the desired outcomes of the land development project in some circumstances communication among design engineers land planning and environmental professionals knowledgeable developers community representatives and regulatory authorities is also beneficial to combine their collective understanding and perspectives to create effective planning efforts preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants unfortunately some common land development practices encourage just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with an impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration designing developments to fit site topography retains much of the natural drainage function in addition designing with the land minimizes the amount of site grading reduces the amount of compaction that can alter site infiltration characteristics and can result in cost savings to the developer protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in fields during the wet season or after large runoff events some development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby eliminating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site to assist in reducing runoff volumes and reducing runoff rates designing around the depression or incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities treats this area as a site amenity rather than a detriment avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff in many instances municipalities have the ability to reduce impervious cover by providing incentives or opportunities in their zoning and subdivision land development ordinances to reduce road width reduce or modify culdesac dimensions reduce or modify curbing requirements and reduce or modify sidewalk requirements 7 disconnecting impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff from these sources and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point within the project site routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to drivewaytostreettostorm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn uses the lawn as a filter strip reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking andor by reducing roadway widths designers should select the narrowest practical street width for the design conditions speed curvature etc narrower neighborhood streets should be considered and encouraged under select conditions reduced street widths also can lower maintenance needs and costs limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines as an alternative to reduced sidewalks where appropriate reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks from streets reduces the size of impervious areas of driveways and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem constructing compact developments or conservation design low impact cluster or compact development can reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots savings result from reduced street length which also contributes to a reduction in development and longterm maintenance costs reduced site disturbance and preservation of open space help buffer sensitive natural areas and retain more of a sites natural hydrology development can be designed so that areas of high infiltration soils are reserved as stormwater infiltration areas construction activity can be focused onto les sensitive areas without affecting the gross density of development stormwater best management practices stormwater best management practices bmps are intended to supplement natural hydrology site design techniques where needed structural in nature such practices include bioretention facilities rain gardens swales and other engineered stormwater bmps listed here are techniques intended to help manage stormwater predominantly at or near the source rather than traditional techniques that largely release runoff over an extended period of time to adjacent properties and streams this list in no way exhaustive gives examples of a few of the most common practices 8 bioretention this type of bmp combines open space with stormwater treatment soil and plants rather than sand filters treat and store runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration are achieved often coupled with an underdrain to collect water not infiltrated or used in the root zone rain gardens typically rain gardens are shallow depression areas containing a mix of water tolerant native plant species the intent is to capture runoff for storage and use in the root zone of plants intended largely as a way of managing stormwater et rain gardens often function as infiltration facilities as well reducing the need for storm sewers increasing the use of natural or vegetated drainage swales can reduce the need for extending storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens who may expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete among others such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads surfaces for which seal coats may be applied should refrain from using permeable paving materials sources conservation design for stormwater management delaware department of natural resources

stormwater management and west nile virus source brodhead mcmichaels creeks watershed act 167 stormwater management draft  the monroe county conservation district recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces the new stormwater policy being integrated into act 167 stormwater management regulations by the pa department of environmental protection padep will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans in addition to meet postconstruction antidegradation standards under the state national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting program applicants will be required to employ best management practices bmps to address nonpoint pollution concerns studies conducted throughout the united states have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants united states environmental protection agency 199 center for watershed protection 2000 from maryland to oregon studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surfaces increase in a watershed the streams in those watersheds become degraded cwp 2000 although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20% there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater bmps are not implemented although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes the conservation district feels that although it may be a valid concern municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management mosquitoes the questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquitoborne west nile virus as is the case with all vectorborne maladies the life cycle of west nile virus is complicated traveling from mosquito to bird back to mosquito and then to other animals including humans culex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first documented cases from new york in 1999 this species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit pennsylvania along with c pipiens three other species have been identified as vectors of west nile virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors the four known vectors in ne pennsylvania are culex pipiens c restuans c salinarius and ochlerotatus japonicus all four of these species prefer and almost exclusively use artificial containers old tires rain gutters birdbaths etc as larval habitats in the case of c pipiens the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes the dirtier the water the better they like it the important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high the remaining four species aedes vexans ochlerotatus canadensis o triseriatus and o trivittatus are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests except the o trivittatus which did have one confirmed vector pool for west nile virus in pa during 2002 all four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains these species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days this can be mitigated however by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands stormwater facilities if a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops mosquitoes should not become a problem wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community if a wetland is planned proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators in natural wetlands predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes the design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding in particular species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable by limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface larvae lose protective cover and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes when incorporated into an open space design a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check publications from the pa department of health and the penn state cooperative extension concerning west nile virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers tires trash cans rain gutters bird baths as the most effective method to control vector mosquitoes conclusion the conservation district understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into stormwater designs as monroe county continues to grow conservation design infiltration and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces when designed and constructed appropriately the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes ordinance
