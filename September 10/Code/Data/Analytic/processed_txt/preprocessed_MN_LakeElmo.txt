creating a moratorium on the establishment of adult uses within the city and directing the city staff to conduct a study to determine how best to regulate such uses the scope of the study was to include but not be limited to the following athe particular zoning districts in which adult establishments should be allowed as either permitted or conditional uses  bthe density and concentration of adult uses  and cthe effect of adult uses on other uses in the surrounding area 2upon completion of the study the matter was to be considered by the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council 3the study has been completed and the planning commission has reviewed the study and has passed its recommendation to the city council for review the city council has also reviewed the staffs study and duly considered the recommendation of the planning commission bthe staffs study contained copies of certain reports specifically including a report which was prepared by the state attorney general entitled report of the attorney generals working group on regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  the report the report considered evidence from studies conducted in minneapolis st paul and many other cities throughout the country relating to sexuallyoriented businesses the city staff planning commission and city council have reviewed the report cthe report based upon the above referenced studies and the testimony and evidence it concluded among other things     that sexuallyoriented businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values    prior to the issuance of the report the state attorney generals working group also heard testimony that     the character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses adjacent to residential property the report found and concluded that 1adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses  2residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters bookstores and other adult uses experience increased crime rates sexrelated crimes in particular lowered property values increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  3the adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult uses increases  4studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes prostitution child molestation indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  5the city of phoenix arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500% higher in areas with sexuallyoriented businesses  6many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are located as less desirable than other areas which do not have such uses  7studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity to adult uses  and 8the indianapolis indiana study established that professional real estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a 1 to 3block area of the store dthe city council finds the characteristics of the city are substantially similar to those of the cities cited by the report when considering the affects of adult uses ethe city council finds based upon the report and the studies cited therein that adult uses may have adverse secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city and that the public health safety and general welfare will be promoted if the city adopts regulations regarding adult uses fthe city council finds that the adverse secondary effects tend to diminish if adult uses in the city are regulated by locational and licensing requirements git is not the intent of the city to prohibit adult uses from having a reasonable opportunity to locate within the city hthe citys current zoning ordinance does not address such adult uses which have been found by other municipalities to cause similar adverse secondary effects specifically the city council is concerned that the citys zoning ordinance may be inadequate in its scope and in its restrictions to accomplish the purpose for which it was intended  iin addition to the proper zoning classification of such uses there are a number of significant planning and land use issues pertaining to the regulation of such uses including the following 1the particular zoning districts in which such uses should be allowed as either permitted or conditional uses  2the concentration and density of such uses in the city and its neighborhoods  and 3the effect of such uses on other uses in the surrounding area

3192013 passed 10012016 xii1 article xii urban residential districts   purpose and district descriptions the urban residential districts are established to provide areas for residential development that are served by public sewer and water services in accordance with the citys comprehensive plan the objectives of these districts are to preserve and enhance the quality of living in residential neighborhoods to regulate structures and uses which may affect the character or desirability of residential areas to encourage a variety of dwelling types and locations and a range of population densities consistent with the citys comprehensive plan and to ensure adequate light air privacy and open space the residential districts and their purposes are as follows a gcc golf course community district the gcc district is intended to permit urban residential developments in conjunction with a golf course and its accessory uses development in this district will be enhanced by coordinated site planning  open space and environmental resources  and provision of a safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicle traffic the gcc district is intended to provide areas for densities lower than other urban residential districts ranging from 14 to 165 units per acre with adequate open space buffers to provide a transition between denser sewered development and rural areas residential development within the gcc district will consist of an environment of predominantly singlefamily dwellings with lots slightly larger on average than those in most urban residential districts b ldr urban low density residential district the ldr district provides an environment of predominantly singlefamily dwellings on moderately sized lots and is designed to be the most restrictive of the urban residential districts the ldr district is intended to provide areas for lower density residential development within the citys planned sewered development areas and may be used to provide a transition between rural development areas and the citys urban development and districts densities shall range from two 2 to 4 units per acre  however the overall density for a specific development area must be consistent with the net densities specified in the comprehensive plan the lot size and other district standards allow for the creation of smaller lots with the expectation that common open space will be provided within developments that exceed the base densities at low end of the land use density range within the comprehensive plan c mdr urban medium density residential district the mdr district is established to provide for a diversity of housing types in those areas where such development is consistent with the medium density residential designation of the comprehensive plan and compatible with the development pattern of the surrounding area clustering of buildings to permit more orderly development and to preserve open space within new developments is encouraged development within the district shall occur at densities in the range of 4 to 7 dwelling units per acre with twofamily dwellings and townhouses permitted the city will determine the allowed density for a piece of property at the time of the development application and this determination will be based upon the sitespecific characteristics of the property and the requested development factors to be considered in increasing or decreasing the allowed density include the existing environmental conditions such as wetlands floodplains steep slopes significant trees  the specific site plan  the amount of open space preserved and the type of housing units xii2 proposed including whether greater density is desirable because the development contains housing that is consistent with the citys housing goals the burden of establishing the appropriateness of the high end of the density range will be on the applicant d hdr urban high density residential district the hdr district is established to provide for an environment of moderate to highdensity attached and multifamily housing designed to present an attractive appearance to neighboring streets and adjacent uses to include sufficient private and semiprivate outdoor space and to be well integrated into their surroundings small office and service businesses of limited size and extent may be allowed as conditional uses the hdr district is appropriate as a transition between commercial or industrial districts and surrounding neighborhoods and in already developed higherdensity areas development within the district may occur at densities in excess of 7 dwelling units per acre provided the overall densities for within a development area are consistent with the net densities specified in the comprehensive plan and that a density

 purpose and district descriptions a muc mixed use commercial the purpose of the mixed use commercial district is to provide areas in the city for and promote mixed use development that supports a sustainable mix of retail commercial and residential uses that will benefit from proximity and adjacency to one another the mixed use commercial district will serve as a transitional district between more intense highwayoriented development and less intense rural or medium density residential uses the intent of the mixed use commercial district is to permit flexibility in the use of the land while providing a set of minimum development standards in site design spatial relationships building architecture and landscape design that will allow property owners to design and construct development projects that respond both to market needs and to city goals and policies the placement and treatment of buildings parking signage landscaping and pedestrian spaces are essential elements in creating a livable environment in a mixeduse area the transitional aspect of development in this district requires projects that are designed with a special focus on mitigating any negative impacts on existing and future development in the area the city will evaluate new development proposals for their consistency with this goal and the city may require developers to amend or change development proposals the city may deny proposals when the city finds them to be inconsistent with the goals and policies of the city the district promotes attractive inviting highquality retail shopping and service areas that are conveniently and safely accessible by multiple travel modes development shall incorporate creative design and buffering techniques to ensure smooth transitions between different types of development or different intensities of uses at least 50 percent of the net developable area of a proposed mixed use commercial development is to be residential and residential development within these areas shall occur at a density range of 1015 units per acre if a proposed development does not include at least 50 percent of the net developable land area in residential development the city will require the applicant to provide a ghost plat buildout plans during sketch plan review that proposes how the parcel or area adjacent to the proposed development will be used in order to meet the requirement for at least 50 percent of the project site with residential land uses this method of subdivision by showing future land use and subdivision and development review is a frontloading process that preserves land for future residential use the city will use the ghost plat or sketch plan as an official document to establish land use consistent with the comprehensive plan b mubp mixed use business park the purpose of the mixed use business park district is to provide areas in the city that will have a mix of general business business park and residential uses having a mixture of land uses within the district allows for better integration of uses and more flexibility to respond to market demands the district promotes high standards of site xiii7 design spatial relationships building architecture and landscape design that will foster compact developments with pedestrian convenience and human scale and will preserve and strengthen existing businesses and land uses the placement and treatment of buildings parking signage landscaping and pedestrian spaces are essential elements in creating a livable environment in a mixeduse area the city will evaluate new development proposals for their consistency with this goal and the city may require developers to amend or change development proposals the city may deny proposals when the city finds them to be inconsistent with the goals and policies of the city the city allows light industrial and limited manufacturing in this district with the city approval of a conditional use permit all business activities and storage in this district are to be conducted inside buildings that are of high quality and attractive the city will require developers and builders in the district to provide open space quality landscaping and berming as part of their projects development in this district shall incorporate creative design and buffering techniques to ensure smooth transitions between different types
