governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss cthe purpose of this chapter is to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief

development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions din order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream

requirements of this chapter bthe city council shall hear and decide appeals when the applicant alleges that the floodplain administrator made an error in any requirement decision or determination in the enforcement or administration of this chapter cin deciding such appeals the city council shall consider all technical evaluations and relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this chapter including the following factors 1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners of the property  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges dupon consideration of the factors of subsection c above and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to appeals and variances granted eany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice signed by the floodplain administrator that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and 2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property fthe floodplain administrator shall record a copy of the notice in the office of ventura county recorder in such manner that the notice appears in the chain of the title of the affected parcel of land gthe floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance decisions including the justification for their issuance and report variances granted in the biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency `64   sec 1827 conditions for variances athe variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the property owner or surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can be met only if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the guidelines are designed to identify situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate cgenerally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new developments to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 2 and 4 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases dvariances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure evariances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result fvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances from an elevation requirement the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council finds will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter gvariances shall be issued only upon a 1showing of good and sufficient cause  2determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in section 182 of this chapter to the applicant  and 3determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in section 182 of this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in section 182 of this chapter of the public or conflict with other city ordinances hvariances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections 1827c h are satisfied that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and that the variance does not result in additional threats to public safety or create a public nuisance `64   article iv provisions for flood hazard reduction sec 1835 standards of construction in all areas of special flood hazards the following

the city council found that rapidly rising rents had occurred in the mobile home parks in the city due to a shortage of mobile home spaces and the high cost of relocating a mobile home the city council also found that the mobile home owners who rented spaces for the mobile homes they owned made a substantial investment in the homes and their spaces for these reasons the city council adopted  in 1982 to protect the mobile home owners in the city from excessive rents and to protect their investment in their homes while at the same time providing for a fair return for park owners  were codified as chapter 24 this chapter of the code bthis chapter was revised in 198 198 1990 and 1991 cin january of 199 the city council established a mobile home rent stabilization ordinance review task force to review the need for mobile home rent stabilization in the city and consider possible amendments to improve the administration of the mobile home park rent stabilization system system provided by this chapter the task force consisted of nine members and five alternates three members and two alternates were selected by the mobile home owners who rent spaces in mobile home parks in the city three members and two alternates were selected by the owners of mobile home parks in the city one member and one alternate were selected by the mobile home park rent review board and two members were appointed by the mayor with the approval of the city council the task force held 11 meetings to consider proposed changes to this chapter and receive public comment concerning rent stabilization at its last meeting in september of 199 the task force adopted a report recommending modifications to various time limits clarification in the definition of certain terms streamlining of the hearing and protest procedures and the appeal process and modifications to the formulas for calculating annual space rent increases based on the consumer price index and change of occupancy increases twelve of the 14 recommendations made by the task force received either a unanimous vote or majority vote from the members representing both the mobile home owners and the mobile home park owners dthe city council held hearings to consider the recommendations of the task force and the mobile home park rent review board and to receive public testimony testimony from park owners and their representatives and testimony from mobile home owners who rent spaces for their homes in mobile home parks in the city the city council also considered the information in various reports provided by staff concerning the administration of this chapter the circumstances in the mobile home parks in the city the circumstances of the mobile home owners who rent spaces for their homes in those mobile home parks the interests of the owners of the mobile home parks in the city and the impact of mobile home rent stabilization on the city ethe city council hereby finds that there continues to be a shortage of mobile home spaces in the city particularly of spaces that are available to owners of homes already in a park who want to move those homes in addition it is expensive to move a mobile home requires a special moving permit and involves tearing down the home having it moved by specialized movers and setting the home up at the new location including complying with new code requirements and upgrading the home as required by the park owner at the new location there is a risk of damage to the home when a mobile home is moved and exterior improvements such as porches patios and carports must often be replaced these facts make it almost impossible for mobile home owners to move their homes the term mobile home is therefore misleading these facts give rise to a market imbalance in which excessive rents can be and often are charged absent regulation further the homeowners make significant investments in their homes and in improving the spaces they rent they are often longterm residents of the city who have strong ties to the community and would prefer to remain in their homes in the city however if the mobile home owners cannot afford to pay rent increases they must attempt to sell their homes and move elsewhere excessive rents can severely impair or destroy the ability to sell a mobile home at a price sufficient to recover the investment in the home further excessive rent increases and lost investment fall with particular harshness on the significant segment of the mobile home owners in the city who are seniors on fixed incomes and the segment of mobile home owners in the city who have low to moderate incomes fbased upon the foregoing findings the city council hereby finds that it is necessary to continue rent stabilization in the mobile home parks in the city  that the amendments to this article are consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the recommendations of the task force  and that the recommendations will improve the administration of this chapter by clarifying some of its terms and streamlining its procedures `64   sec 242 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following words shall have the following
