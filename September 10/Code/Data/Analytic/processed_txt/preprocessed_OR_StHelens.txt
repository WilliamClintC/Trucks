the general prohibitions in shmc 1 or the specific prohibitions in shmc 6c r if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass

notice of decision exemptions  short title this chapter shall be known as the storm water utility ordinance  2003  findings 1the city provides a valuable public service by providing storm drainage facilities for the collection and disposal of storm water discharged from properties and public rightsofway within the city the storm drainage facilities constitute a public utility owned and operated by the city the utility exists for the benefit of any person within the city who wants to have the public storm drainage facilities available for the diversion collection andor disposal of storm drainage and other runoff water from the persons property and represents a municipal service in a developed urban environment which is essential to the public health safety and welfare 2persons who use the public storm drainage facilities ought to be charged fees that reflect the cost of the management maintenance extension and construction of the public storm drainage facility as a public utility in the city persons ought not be compelled to use this utility nor to pay monthly utility fees if the utility is not to be used by the person responsible persons who undertake the installation of runoff control facilities on their property that reduce or eliminate the discharge of storm water into public storm drainage facilities ought to be given credit in proportion to the degree of reduction against storm drainage utility fees that would otherwise be due 3accordingly the structure of the storm drainage utility is intended to be a fee for service and not a charge against the property although this structure is intended to constitute a service fee even if it is viewed as a fee against property or against the person responsible as a direct consequence of ownership of that property the utilitys fee structure should allow the person responsible to have the ability to control the amount of the fee similarly the utility fee structure should reflect the actual cost of providing the service and not impose fees on persons not receiving a service the actual costs may include all costs the utility might incur were it in private ownership 4persons using water from the city potable water facilities use substantial amounts of water for irrigating lawns and gardens washing structures sidewalks driveways and parking lots and for other activities which result in the discharge of runoff into the public storm drainage facilities these uses of water demonstrate a substantial relationship between persons use of these water facilities and their use of the public storm

uses a combination of nondiscretionary and discretionary reviews to evaluate land use proposals for compliance with the use and development requirements of the code the combination is necessary to provide a comprehensive set of implementation tools the nondiscretionary reviews provide the certainty needed in most situations by providing straightforward clear and objective standards discretionary reviews provide needed flexibility by allowing more subjective standards and objectives and providing for the modification of regulations in response to specific site conditions this chapter addresses discretionary reviews 2explanation of discretionary reviews a discretionary review is one that involves judgment or discretion in determining compliance with the approval requirements the review is discretionary because not all of the approval requirements are objective that is they are not easily definable or measurable the amount of discretion and the potential impact of the request varies among different reviews some have less discretion or impact such as the reduction of a garage setback for a house on a hillside others may involve more discretion or potential impacts such as the design review of a new downtown building or the siting of a firm which uses hazardous materials discretionary reviews must provide opportunities for public involvement 3scope this chapter concerns procedures for the consideration of quasijudicial land use applications the oregon supreme court formulated a threepronged test to aid in determining whether action is quasijudicial a whether the process is bound to result in a decision  b whether the decision is bound to apply preexisting criteria to concrete facts  and c whether the action is directed at a closely circumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number of persons strawberry hill 4wheelers v benton county board of commissions 287 or 591 601 p2d 769 1979 common quasijudicial applications include but are not limited to the following sitespecific comprehensive plan map amendment sitespecific rezoning subdivision partition variance site design review 4the function of approval criteria athe approval criteria that are listed with a specific review reflect the findings that must be made to approve a request the criteria set the bounds for the issues that must be addressed by the applicant and which may be raised by the city or affected parties a proposal that complies with all of the criteria will be approved a proposal that can comply with the criteria with mitigation measures or limitations will be approved with conditions a proposal that cannot comply with the criteria outright or cannot comply with mitigation measures will be denied bthe approval criteria have been derived from and are based on the comprehensive plan reviews against the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan are not required unless specifically stated fulfillment of all requirements and approval criteria means the proposal is in conformance with the comprehensive plan cwhen approval criteria refer to the request meeting a specific threshold such as adequacy of services or no significant detrimental environmental impacts the review body will consider any proposed improvements mitigation measures or limitations proposed as part of the request when reviewing whether the request meets the threshold all proposed improvements mitigation measures and limitations must be submitted for consideration prior to a final decision by a review body 5the burden of proof the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that the approval criteria are met the burden is not on the city or other parties to show that the criteria have not been met 6conditions of approval the city may attach conditions to the approval of all discretionary reviews however conditions may be applied only to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable approval criteria for the review or to ensure the enforcement of other city regulations   the application process 1applications for approval required under this chapter may be initiated by aorder of the council  bresolution of a majority

responsibility to the city of st helens to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry 2findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city of st helens are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 3purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  fto help maintain a stable tax

victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare gvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection 7a of this section and otherwise complies with shmc 1a c hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a

interior or exterior storage area required by this code shall be excluded from the calculation of lot coverage and from the calculation of building floor area for purposes of determining minimum storage requirements 3minimum standards method adescription of method this method specifies a minimum storage area requirement based on the size and general use category of the new construction btypical application of method this method is most appropriate when the specific use of a new building is not known it provides specific dimensions for the minimum size of storage areas by general use category capplication requirements and review procedure the size and location of the storage areas shall be indicated on the site plan of any construction subject to this code through the site plan review process compliance with the general and specific requirements set forth below is verified 4general requirements athe storage area requirement is based on the predominant uses of the building eg residential office retail wholesalewarehousemanufacturing educationalinstitutional or other if a building has more than one of the uses listed herein and that use occupies 20 percent or less of the floor area of the building the floor area occupied by that use shall be counted toward the floor area of the predominant uses if a building has more than one of the uses listed herein and that use occupies more than 20 percent of the floor area of the building then the storage area requirement for the whole building shall be the sum of the requirement for the area of each use  bstorage areas for multiple uses on a single site may be combined and shared  and cthe specific requirements are based on an assumed storage height of four feet for solid wasterecyclables vertical storage higher

6waste assessment method adescription of method the waste assessment method tailors the storage area size to a waste assessment and management program for the specific users of a new building btypical application of method this method is most appropriate when the specific use of a building is known and the type and volume of mixed solid waste to be generated can be estimated capplication requirements and review procedures ia preconference with the solid waste coordinatorplan check staff is required if the waste assessment method is proposed the applicant shall obtain a waste assessment form from the local jurisdiction  iithe form shall be used to estimate the volumes of sourceseparated recyclablesmixed solid waste generated from this information the applicant can design a specific management storage and collection system techniques such as a compactor or cardboard baler may be implemented to minimize the square footage of the site which must be set aside for a storage area  and iiithe waste assessment form shall be completed and submitted with site plans required by the local jurisdiction the plans must identify the size and location of interior or exterior storage areas specialized equipment collection schedule etc required to accommodate the volumes projected in the waste assessment the solid waste coordinator shall review and approve the waste assessment as part of the site plan or development review process dspecific requirement the application shall demonstrate that the mixed solid waste and recyclables volumes expected to be generated can be stored in less space than is required by the minimum standards method 7comprehensive recycling plan method adescription of method the comprehensive recycling plan method is most appropriate when an applicant has independently developed a comprehensive recycling plan that addresses materials collection and storage for the proposed use btypical application of method this method can be used when a comprehensive recycling plan has been developed for a specific facility it is most suited to large nonresidential uses such as hospitals schools and industrial facilities the comprehensive recycling plan method can be used for new construction or expansion that is subject to full site plan review capplication requirements and review procedure the comprehensive recycling plan shall be submitted to the solid waste coordinator at the same time site plans are submitted for site plan review the applicant shall submit plans and text that show how mixed solid waste and recyclables generated by the proposed development will be served under a comprehensive recycling plan the location design and access standards set forth in shmc  are applicable to new storage areas only 8franchised hauler review method athe franchised hauler review method is only available in jurisdictions with franchise collection service areas because there is certainty as to what hauler will actually provide service to the proposed development once it is constructed bdescription of method this method provides for coordinated review of the proposed site plan by the franchised hauler serving the subject property ctypical application of method this method is to be used when there are unique conditions associated with the site use or waste stream that make compliance with any of the other three methods infeasible the objective of this method is to match a specific hauler program types of equipment frequency of collection etc to the unique characteristics of the site or development the following constitute unique conditions iuse of either of the three other methods of compliance would interfere with the use of the proposed development by reducing the productive space of the proposed development or make it impossible to comply with the minimum offstreet parking requirements of the underlying zone  iithe site is of an irregular shape or possesses steep slopes that do not allow for access by collection vehicles typically used by the franchised hauler to serve uses similar in size and scope to the proposed use  and iiithe proposed use will generate unique wastes that can be stacked folded or easily consolidated without the need for specialized equipment such as a compactor and can therefore be stored in less space than is required by subsection 3 of this section dapplication requirements and review procedure the applicant shall work with the franchised hauler to develop a plan for storage and collection of sourceseparated recyclables and mixed solid waste expected to be generated from the new building a narrative describing how the proposed site meets one or more of the unique site conditions described above plus site and building plans showing the size and location of storage areas required to accommodate anticipated volumes shall be submitted for site plan review additionally a letter from the franchised hauler shall be submitted at the same time that describes the level of service to be provided by the hauler including any special equipment and collection frequency which will keep the storage area from exceeding its capacity   location design and access standards for

conversion to an auxiliary dwelling unit was created an exception to this regulation is entrances that do not have access from the ground such as entrances from balconies or decks  cparking the parking requirements balance the need to provide adequate parking with maintaining the character of singledwelling neighborhoods and reducing the amount of impervious surface on a site more parking is required when a vacant lot is being developed because generally the site can more easily be designed to accommodate two parking spaces while minimizing impervious surface in situations where an auxiliary dwelling unit is being added to a site with an existing dwelling unit it is appropriate to not require additional impervious surface if adequate onstreet parking is available ithe following parking requirements apply to auxiliary dwelling units ano additional parking space required no additional parking space is required for the auxiliary dwelling unit if it is created on a site with an existing detached singlefamily dwelling or manufactured home and the roadway of at least one abutting street is at least 20 feet wide and allows onstreet parking  bone additional parking space required one additional offstreet parking space is required for the auxiliary dwelling unit as follows 1when none of the roadways in abutting streets are at least 20 feet wide  2when none of the abutting streets allow onstreet parking  or 3when the auxiliary dwelling unit is created at the same time as the detached singlefamily dwelling or manufactured home an auxiliary dwelling unit is

iiwhen an additional offstreet parking space is required it shall comply with the development code and shall be independently functional independently functional means the vehicle in the parking space is not dependent on another vehicle moving to get to the street from the parking space for example a twovehicle garage with a garage door and driveway both 20 feet in width can only count as two parking spaces not four since the vehicles in the garage cannot get to the street without the ones in the driveway moving out of the way in this instance a new additional parking area would need to be created to the side of the garage or elsewhere while still complying with the development code eg parking and access standards dsize iminimum size the size of the auxiliary dwelling unit shall be no less than as allowed by the buildling code  iimaximum size the size of the auxiliary dwelling unit shall be no more than 75 percent of the living area of the detached singlefamily dwelling or

analysis and will be paid for by the applicant 2transportation planning rule compliance see shmc  transportation planning rule compliance 3preapplication conference the applicant will meet with the city engineer prior to submitting an application that requires a traffic impact analysis the city has the discretion to determine the required elements of the tia and the level of analysis expected att b 2011  study area the following facilities shall be included in the study area for all traffic impact analyses unless modified by the city engineer 1all site access points and intersections signalized and unsignalized adjacent to the proposed site in particular if the proposed site fronts an arterial or collector street the analysis shall address all intersections and driveways along the site frontage including those serving parcels on the opposite side of the streets 2roads adjacent to site 3any intersection of two streets each with a classification of collector or arterial where site traffic will exceed 20 vehicles during a peak hour or in the case of a rezone if the trip differential resulting from the rezone will exceed 20 vehicles during a peak hour 4all intersections needed for signal progression analysis 5in addition to these requirements the city engineer may determine any additional intersections or roadway links that may be adversely affected as a result of the proposed development att b 2011  analysis periods to adequately assess the impacts of a proposed land use action the following study periods or horizon years should be addressed in the transportation impact analysis where applicable 1existing year 2background conditions future year the conditions in the year in which the proposed land use action will be completed and occupied but without the expected traffic from the proposed land use action this analysis should include all inprocess developments or city approved developments that are expected to be fully built out in the proposed land use action horizon year it should also account for all inprocessplanned transportation system improvements adepending on funding or project development issues it may not be appropriate to assume that certain planned transportation system improvements will be in place on opening day applicants should contact the city engineer to confirm appropriate assumptions 3full buildout the background condition plus traffic from the proposed land use action assuming full buildout and occupancy 4phased years of completion if the project involves construction or occupancy in phases or for master plans the applicant shall assess the expected roadway intersection and land use conditions resulting from major development phases phased years of analysis will be determined in coordination with city staff 5twentyyear or tsp horizon year for master plans zone changes and conditional uses the applicant shall assess the expected future roadway intersection and land use conditions resulting from deviations from approved comprehensive planning documents a 20year or tsp horizon year analysis will not be required for outright permitted uses under the current zoning att b 2011  peak hour analysis 1the traffic impact analysis shall address the weekday am and pm peak hours when the proposed land use action is expected to generate 25 trips or more during the peak time periods if the applicant can demonstrate that the peak hour trip generation of the proposed land use action is fewer than 25 trips during one of the two peak study periods and the peak trip generation of the land use action corresponds to the roadway system peak then only the worse of the two peak periods must be analyzed this does not mean however that all aspects of the other peak period can be ignored the applicant should consider for example the possibility that inbound and outbound trips at the site driveway have specific operational issues that may need to be addressed for both peak hours 2depending upon the proposed land use action and the expected trip generating characteristics of that development other time periods may be specified either as a substitute for or in addition to the am and pm peak hours examples of land uses that have nontypical trip generating characteristics include schools movie theaters and churches applicants should assume that the city will require additional analysis periods for certain uses as summarized below aschools end of the school day early afternoon peak hour bchurches and worship facilities peak period prior to and after worship services crestaurants midday weekday peak hour dtheaters friday theater peak hour the above list is not necessarily an allinclusive list of uses for which additional analysis periods is required the city engineer and applicant should discuss the potential for additional study periods prior to the start of the traffic impact analysis att b 2011  approval criteria when a traffic impact analysis is required approval of the development proposal requires satisfaction of the following criteria 1the traffic impact analysis was prepared by an oregon registered professional engineer using the analysis procedures of the highway capacity manual latest edition  2if the proposed development shall cause one or more of the effects per shmc  or other traffic hazard or negative impact to a transportation facility the traffic impact analysis shall include mitigation measures that meet the citys adopted levelofservice standards per the transportation systems plan and noted under shmc  and are satisfactory to the city engineer and odot when applicable  and 3the proposed site design and traffic and circulation design and facilities for all transportation modes including any mitigation measures are designed to ahave the least negative impact on all applicable transportation facilities  baccommodate and encourage nonmotor vehicular modes of transportation to the extent practicable  cmake the most efficient use of land and public facilities as practicable  dprovide the most direct safe and convenient routes practicable between onsite destinations and between onsite and offsite destinations  and eotherwise comply with applicable requirements of the shmc att b 2011  conditions of approval the city may deny approve or approve a development proposal with appropriate conditions

given basin must be addressed by dividing the basin area into subbasin areas of similar land use andor runoff characteristics hydrographs should be computed for each subbasin area and superimposed to form the total runoff hydrograph for the basin cselection of curve number the national resource conservation service nrcs formerly referred to as the soil conservation service scs has developed curve

groups according to their runoff characteristics the following are important criteria and considerations for selection of cn values imany factors may affect the cn value for a given land use for example the movement of heavy equipment over bare ground may compact the soil so that it has a lower infiltration rate and greater runoff potential iicn values can be areaweighted when they apply to pervious areas of similar cn within 20 cn points however high cn areas should not be combined with low cn areas unless the low cn areas are less than 15 percent of the subbasin dtime of concentration time of concentration tc is the time for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point where the hydrograph is to be calculated travel time tt is the time it

accidents and violates the rules of the road stated in the uniform vehicle lanes on oneway streets should be on the right side of the street except in areas where a bicycle lane on the left would decrease the number of conflicts under ideal conditions minimum bicycle lane width is five feet however certain edge conditions dictate additional desirable bicycle lane width in the case where bike lanes are adjacent to monolithic curb and gutters a minimum lane width of four feet should be maintained from the edge of the longitudinal joint between the pavement and the gutter where parking is permitted adjacent to a bicycle lane it is preferable to designate separate parking and bicycle lanes where parking volume is substantial andor turnover is high an additional one or two feet of width is desirable for safe bicycle operation bicyclists do not generally ride near a curb because of the possibility of debris of hitting a pedal on the curb of an uneven longitudinal joint or of a steeper crossslope bicycle lanes in this location should have a minimum width of five feet from the curb face if the longitudinal joint between the gutter pan and the roadway surface is uneven and falls within five feet of the curb face a minimum of four feet should be provided between the joint and the motor vehicle lanes bicycle lanes on a highway without curb or gutter bicycle lanes should be located between the motor vehicle lanes and the roadway shoulders bicycle lanes may have a minimum width of four feet where the shoulder can provide additional maneuvering width a width of five feet or greater is preferable  additional widths are desirable where substantial truck traffic is present on grades or where motor vehicle speeds exceed 35 miles per hour at intersections bicyclists proceeding straight motorist turning right must cross paths striping and signing configurations which encourage these crossings in advance of the intersection in a merging fashion are generally preferable to those that force the crossing in the immediate vicinity of the intersection to a lesser extent the same is true for leftturning bicyclists  however in this maneuver oregons vehicle codes allow the bicyclist the option of making either a vehicular style left turn where the bicyclist merges leftward to the same lane used for motor vehicle left turns or a pedestrian style left turn where the bicyclist proceeds straight intersection turns left at the far side then proceeds across the intersection again on the cross street where there are numerous leftturning bicyclists a separate turning lane as indicated in of the mutcd should be considered general guidance for pavement marking of bicycle lanes is contained in the mutcd adequate pavement surface bicyclesafe grate inlets safe railroad crossings and traffic signals responsive to bicycles should always be provided on roadways where bicycle lanes are being designated raised pavement markings and raised barriers can be dangerous obstacles for bicyclists and should not be used to delineate bicycle lanes 4widened sidewalk widened sidewalks for bicycle use should only be considered where more preferred facilities such as separated pathways bike lanes or shared roadway facilities are not possible due to street rightofway constraints or within developed areas where independent rightsofway cannot be provided widened sidewalks should be considered where pathways terminate at poor street crossing locations to lead bicyclists to safe crossing locations where widened sidewalks are used as a designated bikeway they should be identifiable by striping signing or lighting  or a combination of these features ideally widened sidewalks are used only where planter strips are also present widened sidewalks should not be encumbered by utility poles hydrants driveway aprons street trees signposts and other obstacles which act to reduce the usable width of the facility alignment alternatives shall consider minimizing street and driveway crossings widened sidewalks should maintain a constant grade and minimize dips and rises associated with driveway crossings 5bikewaywheelchair ramps intersection curb cuts or ramps commonly referred to as wheelchair ramps serve a multitude of user groups  these include in addition to wheelchairs bicyclists the elderly ranging from using walkers canes or adult tricycles the visually impaired or other handicapped persons due to this range of users and the variety of their needs when utilizing sidewalks it is imperative that all intersections be equipped with an adequate system of ramps design components for ramps must consider slope width of the ramp angle of approach surface roughness pavement appurtenances ie catch basins valve covers etc and gutter smoothness curb ramps must meet the design criteria established by the americans with disabilities act ada appx 720 2003 environmental protection erosion prevention and sediment control rules introduction general policy enforcement erosion prevention and sediment control contaminated soils  introduction this chapter identifies requirements for erosion prevention and sediment control epsc the provisions of this chapter are intended to prevent and reduce adverse impacts to the drainage system and water resources in combination with other state federal and local laws and ordinances these requirements are intended to protect the beneficial uses of waters within the greater st helens service district the city will follow the best management practices bmps for epsc as detailed in the erosion prevention and sediment control planning and design manual issued services of washington county appx 810 2003  general policy 1erosion prevention and sediment control policy this chapter specifies the use of erosion prevention techniques and sediment control measures the use of erosion prevention techniques shall be emphasized rather than sediment control measures this shall be especially important on larger construction sites immediately before and during the rainy season erosion prevention techniques are designed to protect soil particles from the force of rain and wind so that they will not erode these techniques include but are not limited to such things as construction scheduling ground cover and matting sediment control measures are designed to capture soil particles after they have been dislodged and attempt to retain the soil particles on site these measures include but are not limited to silt fences sediment barriers and settling basins both erosion prevention techniques and sediment control measures have appropriate uses  however numerous case studies have shown that sediment control measures are less effective in preventing soil movement than erosion prevention techniques 2existing vegetation as far as practicable the existing vegetation shall be protected and left in place in accordance with the clearing limits on the approved erosion prevention and sediment control plans work areas shall be carefully located and marked to reduce potential damage trees shall not be used as anchors for stabilizing working equipment where existing vegetation has been removed or the original land contours disturbed the site shall be revegetated and the vegetation established as soon as practicable appx 820 2003  enforcement failure to comply with any provision

developed in 1978 in response to oregon revised statute 197 and senate bill 100 the plan was acknowledged by the department of land conservation and development in 1984 and has had several minor amendments and one major update in 1991 this is the second major update since its inception the official comprehensive plan shall be the goals and policies and the maps supporting documents shall be history background data surveys and assumptions the basis for this plan is first the assumption that use of land requires order beyond that of simply economic determination as such the federal government has encouraged land use planning and in particular land use comprehensive plans since 1928 with the passage of a standard city planning enabling act the state of oregon has refined the planning process with the passage of senate bill 100 in 1973 the second basis for this plan is a continuation of the earlier versions which were built upon a great deal of data citizen input staff thought and legislative deliberations before it was presented to the state as the plan for the city of st helens to use as the guide for land use in the short and long term this amendment adds to the 1978 comprehensive plan by updating it and modifying some of the goals and policies as befit the changes in facts data assumptions and desires of the community the definition of comprehensive plan is found in ors  it means a generalized coordinated land use map and policy statement of the governing body of a local government that interrelates all functional and natural systems and activities relating to the use of lands including but not limited to sewer and water systems transportation systems educational facilities recreational facilities and natural resources and air and water quality management programs comprehensive means allinclusive both in terms of the geographic area covered and functional and natural activities and systems occurring in the area covered by the plan general nature means a summary of policies and proposals in broad categories and does not necessarily indicate specific locations of any area activity or use a plan is coordinated when the needs of all levels of governments semipublic and private agencies and the citizens of oregon have been considered and accommodated as much as possible land includes water both surface and subsurface and the air generally this plan shall follow the oregon statewide land use planning goals and guidelines for goals 1 2 and 5  general goals and policies citizen involvement economic goals and policies public services and facilities goals and policies transportation goals and policies housing goals and policies natural factors and local resources goals and policies  citizen involvement ref statewide

develop and implement programs to involve as many citizens as possible in the land use planning process bat least annually inform the citizens of the city of land use activities for the last year and proposed plans for land use activities for the coming year   economic goals and policies ref statewide planning goal 9 1preface historically the city of st helens economy has been directly related to the columbia river forests and mineral aggregate resources in the last decade there has been a significant shift in employment with over 50 percent of the residents commuting out of the county for employment this is not a result of dying industries as much as it is a phenomenon of lower land costs good quality of life and reasonable commute times economic growth in the city of st helens is mostly due to population growth new businesses are locating here to serve the growing population some new industrial growth is occurring but with very few jobs the largest employers inside the city limits are government agencies then forestwood products manufacturers and then retailers the city has over two miles of water front and another mile of water front in the urban growth area there are three marinas and about 2700 feet of public docks with the citys history of being a very old town relative to oregons history located on the largest river in the northwest tourism is a major target of the city leaders plans for increased economic development the citys vision plan envisions a maximum of 50 percent commuters increased tourism and self sufficiency in several areas such as healthcare and jobs the citys leaders are working with business leaders in developing plans to encourage more businesses to locate in st helens the citys leaders are coordinating with state leaders to improve the attractiveness of st helens for businesses and industries to locate in st helens 2goals ato maintain favorable conditions for a growing healthy stable and diversified business and industrial climate bto encourage the expansion of employment opportunities within the urban area so residents can work within their communities rather than commute to jobs outside the county cto promote

improvement is impacted by and impacts public facilities public services usually include police fire health schools recreation and library while public services are very important they do not impede development but rather react to development the city of st helens has master plans and a general public facilities plan for all the essential public facilities the city also has plans or agreements with many providers of the public services 2goals ato provide the facilities utilities and services which are necessary for the wellbeing of the community bto develop an orderly arrangement of public facilities and services to serve as a framework for urban development cto design and locate public facilities so that capacities are related to future as well as present demands  ample land is

boundary  or iiareas designated as a health hazard according to the procedures required by state law  or iiiareas zoned for rural industrial use or a resource zone for a resourcerelated use for which the following findings have been made athere is no feasible alternative for servicing the rural industrial or resourcerelated use considering water availability soil suitability for subsurface sewage disposal costs of a subsurface system the long term viability of a subsurface system to function successfully or state or federal environmental regulations  bprovisions of municipal sewer or water service will not impair the citys longterm ability to service land within the city limits or urban growth boundary  cthe proposed extension of municipal sewer or water service will not serve any

have started with a small area and expanded into areas with countytype roads many of our roads are gravel and many are substandard based upon current requirements overall the system of roads bike paths and pedestrian paths serves the community adequately in most areas there are some areas lacking in pedestrian paths between new developments and existing developments most of the transportation system is addressed in the public facilities plan and there are general schedules and estimated costs for bringing the transportation facilities into compliance with current standards 2goals ato develop and maintain methods for moving people and goods which are iresponsive to the needs and preferences of individuals business and industry  iisuitably integrated into the fabric of the urban
