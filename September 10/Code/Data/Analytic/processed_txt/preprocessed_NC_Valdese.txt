goals the purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas the goals of this article are to i encourage the location of towers in nonresidentialnonhistorical areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community ii enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  iii encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites iv encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal and v encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas bprincipal usetelecommunication towers shall be considered principal uses alternative tower structures may be considered principal or accessory uses for purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations including but not limited to setback requirements lot size and coverage requirements and other such requirements the dimensions of the entire lot shall control even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots 1005  610 administrative approved uses the following uses may be

state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the town council of the town of valdese north carolina does ordain as follows 607 findings of fact 1the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards 607 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote public health safety and general welfare and to public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 607 objectives the objectives of this article are to 1protect human life safety and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and

the environmental management commission thereunder  session law 2006246   185 313 findings it is hereby determined that 1development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  2these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and 3these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites 4further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article 5therefore the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge 313 purpose ageneral the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources bspecific this article seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources  2requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre development hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7establishing administrative procedures for the submission review
