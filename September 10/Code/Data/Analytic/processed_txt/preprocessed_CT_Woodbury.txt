the design of detention basins b1 technical guidelines for the design of detention basins design guidelines if detention basins are necessary as part of a stormwater management plan they must be designed in accordance with currently accepted engineering design practices included in the design submission must be the following 1 map showing site its location within the watershed and the watershed limits all detention facilities serving a watershed larger than 10 acres in size shall be analyzed with hydrograph and storage routing techniques 2 examination of the routing of stormwater site and its flow pat as it is discharged from the site subdrainage basin limits within the watershed must be delineated 3 determination of the full flow capacity of downstream watercourses or storm drainage structures the lowest capacity values found will determine the maximum flow rates at which stormwater may be released from the site unless there is sufficient wetland area available downstream to detain and gradually release excess stormwater flows 4 designation of the locations of the proposed detention basins provide hydrographs for the stormwater runoff from those areas tributary to the proposed detention facility existing and proposed conditions must be evaluated hydrographs for storms with average return frequencies 2 10 and 50 year 24 hour type iii storms should be computed selection of the appropriate method for developing these hydrographs should be based upon the size of the contributing drainage areas and the design output requirements of the connecticut guidelines for soil erosion and sediment control dated january 198 as amended should be used as a guide 5 design the detention basin based on results of the above steps touting analyses should be completed for the hydrographs generated in subsection 4 above special attention should be given to providing an emergency spillway to pass excess flows from the 100 year storm of the connecticut guidelines for soil erosion and sediment control dated january 198 as amended should be used as a guide in the design 6 the detention basin may be designed to drain dry or retain water for extended periods after rain events dry basins are recommended over wet basins retention type 7 the depthareavolume relationship of the basin is dependent on the storage volume needed to reduce the peak inflow rate to some desired peak outflow rate as the natural contours in the site dictate ponding depths should be kept as shallow as possible however where stormwater storage depths exceed four 4 feet a bench width of six 6 feet should be provided around the entire perimeter of the basin exclusive of bermed areas at every four 4 vertical feet of storage depth b2 8 outlets from normally dry detention basins can take on a number of forms limited only by safety and maintenance considerations outlet pipe must be at least 12 inches in diameter to facilitate maintenance if less capacity is required than a 12 inch pipe would provide flow should be throttled at the pipe entrance trash racks or perforated rises are required at inlets to help guard against plugging of the pipe 9 the side slope of the basin should be no steeper than four horizontal to one vertical  for the safety of mechanical mowing equipment and the safety of people during those times when water is being stored all grades on the bottom of this basin should be at least two percent so that the bottom will drain quickly and leave no wet spots 10 an emergency spillway outlet should be provided for discharge of inflows in the event the storage capacity is exceeded or the drainage system plugged it must be designed for the 100 year storm frequency event 11 easements should be included if necessary and access roads provided to allow vehicles and other equipment the access needed for maintenance of the basin 12 if detention is to be of the wet basin retention type the volume needed for temporary storage must be provided above the normal pond elevation a 10 foot width of maximum two percent slope should surround the pond just above the normal pond elevation to provide a safe landing place for those who may slip down the slope adjacent to the pond 13 the outlet structure of wet basins retention type must be constructed such that the pond level is maintained the side slopes beneath the water surface of the pond should be two horizontal to one vertical  to a depth of three or four feet to discourage the growth of aquatic plants unless a wetland system is developed along the shoreline of the pond if fish are to be stocked in the pond at least 25% of the ponds area should be at least ten feet deep c1 appendix c amendments to text of subdivision regulations effective date reference  added relating to sewer
