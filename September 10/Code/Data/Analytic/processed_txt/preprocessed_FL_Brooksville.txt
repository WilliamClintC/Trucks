and occurs in a manner which is incompatible with the normal primary activity of a particular place at a particular time m the city councils sole intent in enacting this article is to prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the adverse secondary effects such nudity generates the city council nevertheless recognizes that there may be instances wherein appearing nude in a public place may be expressive conduct incidental to and a necessary part of the freedom of expression that is protected by united states or florida constitutional provisions n a requirement that dancers don opaque covering sufficient to cover the buttocks and the breasts as such portions of the human anatomy are defined in this article does not deprive the dance of whatever erotic message if any it may convey but simply makes such message if any slightly less graphic and imposes only an incidental limitation on the message o it is the intent of the city council to protect and preserve the public health safety welfare and morals of the city by restricting to the full extent allowed by the united states and florida constitutions the act of being nude to places which are not frequented by the public and places which are not readily visible to the public p the city is essentially a ruralsuburban community without the sophistication and urbanity of a large metropolitan area q the city council finds and determines that the average person applying contemporary the city community standards would find that the public nudity prohibited by this article if allowed when taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interests and lacks serious literary artistic political and scientific value r nonregulation of persons appearing nude in public places within the city may encourage commercial entities and other entities and persons to advertise outside of the city and the state by billboard radio print and other media the availability of nudity in public places within the city and thus encourages the influx into the city of persons seeking to observe andor participate in such nudity and to participate in the disorderly harmful and unlawful conduct that is associated therewith thereby increasing injuries and damages to the citizens of this county who will be victims of such increased disorderly harmful and unlawful conduct s competitive commercial advertising andor exploitation of nudity encourages escalation of nude and lewd conduct within the competing commercial establishments exploiting such conduct and thereby increases the adverse effects upon public order and the public health t the city council finds and determines that the prohibitions contained in this article are the most reasonable and minimal restrictions required so as to regulate conduct which is adverse to public order health morality and decency within the city when such conduct takes place at locations where the public is present or is likely to be present or where such conduct would be readily visible to the public u the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived is necessary to preserve the basic character of the city v the city council is aware that states may

constitutionally protected rights y the city council finds and determines that this article is consistent with its current comprehensive plan 1110 12152003 legislative findings in addition and

eg findings of the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention m sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the

religious establishments schools parks licensed day care centers and other areas or establishments frequented by families and children pose particular issues of safety and concern in view of the previous findings herein r the findings noted in subsections a2a a2q of this substantial governmental concerns s sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns t a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein u removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the unlawful and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments v the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity w it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity x the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases z the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this substantial case law from the us circuit court of appeals for the 11th circuit as applicable to federal court jurisdiction in florida supports the validity of a licensing ordinance with provisions similar to those contained herein based on findings of the type cited in this 3 conclusions a it is the finding of the city council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions in the same manner other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community b among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct prostitution public solicitation public indecency drug use and drug trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described the city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions would result in the city as well c the city council therefore concludes that it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses neighborhoods churches schools residential areas public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments therefore the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment the city council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests including but not limited to reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression b classification sexually

plan an available capacity review may be conducted by the city this procedure is a review and does not constitute a binding determination by the city 2 the following public facilities will be reviewed for adequacy to serve the subject site potable water sewage treatment drainage solid waste parks and recreation facilities public schools and transportation a for potable water sewage treatment drainage solid waste parks and recreation facilities and transportation where capacity will not be available to serve the property seeking a development permit and alternative mitigation is not available or agreeable then the city may use the lack of such infrastructure capacity as a basis for denial of the development permit b for public schools where capacity will not be available to serve students from the residential property seeking a development permit and alternative mitigation is not available or agreeable then the city may use the lack of school capacity as a basis for denial of the development permit 3 available capacity review is not a concurrency determination and does not relieve the applicant from applying for a concurrency determination 4 any person may request an available capacity review at any time for the public facilities identified in this 5 a nonrefundable available capacity review fee will be established by resolution of the city council b certificate

school board 9 application process a within ten working days of receipt of a complete school concurrency application the city will transmit said application to the school district for a determination of whether there is adequate school capacity for each level of school to accommodate the proposed development based on the level of service los standards concurrency service areas and other standards set forth in this within 30 days of receipt of the initial transmittal from the city the school district will review the school concurrency application and based on the standards set forth in this report in writing to the city i whether adequate school capacity exists for each level of school based on the standards set forth in this its adopted comprehensive plan  or ii if adequate capacity does not exist whether appropriate mitigation can be accepted and if so acceptable options for mitigation consistent with this c concurrency certificate validity 1 an application for a certificate of concurrency shall be applied for at the time an application is made for any development order or approval referenced in the preceding 2 a certificate of concurrency shall expire simultaneously with

transferred offsite or to any other project or parcels 4 any alteration in scope density magnitude location project traffic circulation andor distribution for the subject property must be reported to and approved by the city for certificate reevaluation if such alterations are not reported the certificate of concurrency will be subject to revocation 5 public facilities must serve land development in accordance with the adopted level of service standards contained within the city comprehensive plan this certificate of concurrency when issued by the city verifies adequate capacity until its stated expiration date as provided in subparagraph b above notwithstanding anything to the contrary a certificate of concurrency offers no other assurance does not approve any development order and

satisfy the concurrency requirement 1 all new residential development shall be subject to public school facilities concurrency unless exempted herein 2 concurrency service areas csas a csas will be developed based upon school attendance zones so that there is school capacity in each concurrency service area or contiguous concurrency service area to meet the adopted level of service standard within the fiveyear time frame contained in the school boards adopted fiveyear work program as such work program is updated annually by the school board and incorporated by reference into the citys capital improvement element b csas shall be subsequently modified to maximize available school capacity and make efficient use of new and existing public school facilities in accordance with the adopted los standards and taking into account policies which i minimize transportation costs  ii limit maximum student travel times  iii affect desegregation plans  iv achieve socioeconomic racial and cultural diversity objectives  v recognize capacity commitments resulting from the development approvals by the city for the csa  and vi recognize capacity commitments resulting from development approvals by the city for contiguous csas c all csas will be described geographically and appropriately mapped e calculation of capacity the school district will determine whether adequate school capacity exists for a proposed residential development based on the adopted los as follows 1 calculate total public school facilities by adding the capacity provided by existing public school facilities except magnetlottery schools to the capacity of any planned school facilities 2 calculate available public school capacity by subtracting from the total public school facilities the sum of a used capacity  b the portion of reserved capacity projected to be developed within three years  c the portion of previously approved development projected to be developed within three years  and d the demand on public schools created by the proposed development f determination of sufficient school capacity for residential development 1 in determining whether there is sufficient school capacity to accommodate a proposed residential development the school district will consider a subject csa available capacity will be determined based upon permanent fish capacity of existing and planned facilities at each public school type ie elementary middle and high  and b contiguous csa if the projected student growth from a residential development causes the adopted los to be exceeded in the subject csa then each contiguous csa will be reviewed for available capacity pursuant to this shall take into account i travel time and distance school bus route from the school to the site of the proposed development should not exceed 50 minutes  ii where school capacity is reserved for a specific academic or magnet programs at a particular school or for establishing student diversity then such capacity cannot be claimed in a contiguous concurrency service area for purposes of determining available capacity  and iii where two csas are separated or divided by the withlacoochee state forest then they shall not be deemed contiguous for purposes of determining available capacity c in conducting the contiguity review the school district shall first use the contiguous csa with the most available capacity to evaluate projected enrollment and if necessary shall continue to the csa with the next most available capacity until all contiguous csas have been evaluated or the available capacity has been identified to allow a determination letter approving school concurrency to be issued if a contiguous csa is identified having available capacity then the actual development impacts shall be shifted to that csa having available capacity this shift shall be accomplished in accordance with school board policy and which may include without limitation appropriate boundary changes or shifting future student assignments g issuance of residential development orders predicated on sufficient public school facility capacity 1 the issuance of development orders for new residential units shall be predicated on the availability of public school capacity 2 whether there is adequate public school capacity to accommodate students generated by the proposed development for each type of public school within the affected csa consistent with the adopted los standard will take into consideration that a adequate public school facilities will be in place or under actual construction within three years after the issuance of the subdivision approval or site plan or functional equivalent  or b adequate public school facilities are available in an adjacent csa and the impacts of development can be shifted to that area  or c the developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the actual development of the property subject to the subdivision approval or site plan or functional equivalent pursuant to this 3 if the impact of the proposed development will not occur until years two or three of the school boards work plan then any relevant programmed improvements in those years shall be considered available capacity for the project and factored into the level of service analysis if the impact of the project will not occur until years four or five of the work plan then any relevant programmed improvements shall not be considered available capacity for the project unless funding of the improvements is assured board funding to accelerate the project share mitigation or some other means 4 if the school district determines that adequate capacity does not exist but that the developers proffered proportionate share mitigation agreement is an acceptable alternative the development application will remain active pending the conclusion of the mitigation negotiation period 5 the city will issue a certificate of concurrency for public schools only upon a the school districts written determination that adequate school capacity will be in place or under actual construction within three years after the issuance of subdivision approval or site plan approval or functional equivalent for each level of school without mitigation  or b the execution of a legally binding mitigation agreement between the applicant the school board and the city h in determining the availability of services or facilities a developer may propose and the city may approve

purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program in a manner consistent with fs   b findings the city council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the city proportionate fairshare program 1 provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors  2 allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fair share of the cost of expanding or improving a transportation facility  3 contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  and 4 maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element c applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to any development project in the city where the projects traffic impact study or the citys community development or public works directors determine that there is insufficient capacity on one or more segments to satisfy the development projects transportation concurrency requirements the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in this d general requirements 1 an applicant whose project meets the criteria of this section may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations and b the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the city or county capital improvements element cie includes one or more transportation improvements that upon completion will provide sufficient capacity for the deficient segments to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development 2 the city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment proportionate fairshare program by the developer contributing to an improvement that upon completion will create additional capacity on the deficient segment sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicants proposed development even if the improvement project for the deficient segment is not contained in the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie where a the city council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate share agreement and corresponding future changes to the fiveyear cie and b the city adopts by ordinance or resolution a commitment to add the improvement to the fiveyear cie to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed schedule of capital improvements in the cie must be reviewed by the city council 3 if the funds allocated for the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system the city may enter into a binding proportionate fairshare agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair share is calculated if the proportionate fair share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the government entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities significantly benefit the impacted transportation system 4 improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the fiveyear capital improvements schedule at the next annual capital improvements update 5 any improvement project proposed to meet a developers fairshare obligation must meet design standards of the city or county for locally maintained roadways in their jurisdiction and those of the florida department of transportation fdot for the state highway system e application process 1 upon identification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program pursuant to the requirements of this section 2 prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fairshare agreement the applicant shall attend a preapplication meeting with appropriate staff to discuss eligibility application submittal requirements potential mitigation options and related issues if the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system sis then the florida department of transportation fdot will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication meeting 3 eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes nonrefundable application fee as established by resolution and the following a name address and phone number of owners developer and agent  b property location including parcel identification numbers  c legal description and survey of property  d project description including type intensity and amount of development  e phasing schedule if applicable  f description of requested proportionate fairshare mitigation methods  g copy of concurrency application  h copy of the projects traffic impact statement tis or traffic impact analysis tia  and i location map depicting the site and affected road network 4 within ten business days the chief administrative officer shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete if an application is determined to be insufficient incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fairshare program as indicated in this section then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of submittal of the application if such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification then the application shall be deemed abandoned the city council may in its discretion grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure 5 pursuant to fs ch  proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires consultation with the florida department of transportation fdot if an sis facility is proposed for proportionate share mitigation the applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the fdot for inclusion in the proportionate fairshare agreement 6 when an application is deemed sufficient complete and eligible a proposed proportionate fairshare obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review including a copy to the fdot for any proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation on a strategic intermodal system sis facility no later than 60 days from the date at which the application was determined to be sufficient and no fewer than 14 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered 7 the city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final approval no proportionate fairshare agreement will be effective until approved by the city council f determining proportionate fairshare obligation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 2 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair share the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation 3 the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be as provided for in fs ch 163 as follows the cumulative number of peak hour peak direction trips from the complete build out of the proposed development or build out of the stage or phase being approved that are assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided by the change in the peak hour directional maximum service volume msv of the proportionate share program segment resulting from construction of the proportionate share program improvement multiplied by the anticipated construction cost of the proportionate share project in the year that construction will occur this methodology is expressed by the following formula proportionate fair share   sdevelopment trips i   sv increase i   cost i  note in the context of the formula the term cumulative does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development where s  sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fairshare mitigation for a project development trips i   those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system sv increase i   service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i cost i   adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs including design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur in using the proportionateshare formula provided herein the applicant in its traffic analysis shall identify those roads or facilities that have a transportation deficiency in accordance with the transportation deficiency as defined below the proportionateshare formula provided in this subsection shall be applied only to those facilities that are determined to be significantly impacted by the project traffic under review if any road is determined to be transportation deficient without the project traffic under review the costs of correcting that deficiency shall be removed from the projects proportionateshare calculation and the necessary transportation improvements to correct that deficiency shall be considered to be in place for purposes of the proportionateshare calculation the improvement necessary to correct the transportation deficiency is the funding responsibility of the entity that has maintenance responsibility for the facility the developments proportionate share shall be calculated only for the needed transportation improvements that are greater than the identified deficiency when the provisions of this subsection have been satisfied for a particular stage or phase of development all transportation impacts from that stage or phase for which mitigation was required and provided shall be deemed fully mitigated in any transportation analysis for a subsequent stage or phase of development trips from a previous stage or phase that did not result in impacts for which mitigation was required or provided may be cumulatively analyzed with trips from a subsequent stage or phase to determine whether an impact requires mitigation for the subsequent stage or phase in projecting the number of trips to be generated by the development under review any trips assigned to a tollfinanced facility shall be eliminated from the analysis as used in this subsection the term transportation deficiency means a facility or facilities on which the adopted levelofservice standard is exceeded by the existing committed and vested trips plus additional projected background trips from any source other than the development project under review and trips that are forecast by established traffic standards including traffic modeling consistent with the university of floridas bureau of economic and business research medium population projections additional projected background trips are to be coincident with the particular stage or phase of development under review 4 for purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual andor anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur these costs will be determined by the citys public works department accepted sources for determining improvement costs may include but not be limited to the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs as adjusted based upon the type of crosssection and locally available data from recent projects 5 if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineers certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the citys public works director or other method approved by the citys public works director 6 if the city has accepted rightofway dedication for the proportionate fair share payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and will be at no expense to the city said appraisal shall assume no approved development plan for the site the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant based on a cityapproved appraisal is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant based on a cityapproved appraisal is more than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for the development then the city will give the applicant roads impact fee credit for the difference g impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation payments for a development project shall be applied as a credit toward the roads impact fees assessed to that development project to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the applicable impact fee ordinance 2 impact fee credits for a proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the roads impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development if the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated roads impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant must pay the remaining impact fee amount 3 a proportionate fairshare contribution is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location as a result any roads impact fee credit based upon proportionate fairshare contributions for a proposed development may not be transferred to any other location 4 the amount of roads impact fee rif credit for a proportionate fairshare contribution may be up to but shall not exceed the projects proportionate fair share amount 5 a proportionate fair share impact fee credit shall be applied consistent with the following formula applicant payment   total project roads impact fees assessed + proportionate share payment  rif credit h proportionate fairshare agreements 1 upon executing a proportionate fairshare agreement agreement and satisfying other concurrency requirements an applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval should the applicant fail to apply for building permits within the time frame provided for in the city concurrency certificate then the projects concurrency vesting shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply once a proportionate share payment for a project is made and other impact fees for the project are paid no refunds shall be given all payments however shall run with the land 2 payment of the proportionate fairshare contribution for a project and payment of other impact fees assessed to that project shall be due and must be paid prior to the effective date of the proportionate fair share agreement the effective date shall be specified in the agreement and shall be the date the agreement is approved by the city council 3 all developer improvements accepted as proportionate fair share contributions must be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share agreement and be accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements the security instrument shall conform to the subdivision construction security requirements utilized by the city community development department it is the intent of this any required improvements be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share agreement 4 dedication of necessary rightofway for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fairshare agreement must occur prior to the effective date of the proportionate fair share agreement 5 any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation 6 applicants may withdraw from a proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement the application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city are nonrefundable 7 the city may enter into proportionate fairshare agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility i appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city capital improvements element or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement proportionate fairshare revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the fdot transportation regional incentive program trip 2 in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the capital improvements element cie then the proportionate fair share revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that same corridor or sector where the alternative improvement will mitigate the impacts of the development project on the congested roadways for which the original proportionate fair share contribution was made   public school facilities proportionate fairshare mitigation a purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of proposed residential development on public school facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs   it is acknowledged that state statutes and standards may change and given such that the school district may identify alternatives to the mitigation methods provided in this section the city shall therefore recognize a certificate of concurrency issued by the school district that utilizes mitigation methods not identified in this section b findings the brooksville city council finds and determines that public school facilities capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the city proportionate fairshare program 1 provides a method by which the impacts of development on public school facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors  2 allows developers to

circumstances allow the school board to expedite public school facilities improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for public school facilities improvements in the capital improvements element c applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to any residential development project in the city of brooksville where the projects impact indicates that there is insufficient capacity to satisfy the development projects public school facilities concurrency requirements the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in this d general requirements an applicant whose project meets the criteria of this section may choose to satisfy public schools facilities concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution pursuant to the following requirements 1 the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations and 2 the school district determines that adequate capacity does not exist but that mitigation is an acceptable alternative and the developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation acceptable to the school district proportionate to the demand for public school facilities created by the actual development project e mitigation alternatives 1 in the event the proposed project meets the requirements for proportionate fair share contribution the following procedure shall be used a the applicant shall initiate in writing a mitigation negotiation period with the school board in order to establish an acceptable form of mitigation b acceptable forms of mitigation may include i the donation construction or funding of school facilities sufficient to offset the demand for public school facilities to be created by the proposed development ii construction of a charter school that complies with the requirements of fs  10023318 iii the creation of mitigation banking based on the developers construction andor financing of a public school facility in exchange for the right to sell excess capacity credits the selling of excess credits shall be limited to that area within the subject csa or any abutting csa and as may be further limited by this 2 the following standards apply to any proportionate share mitigation agreement a relocatable classrooms will not be accepted as mitigation b mitigation shall be directed to projects on the school boards fiveyear work plan that the school district agrees will satisfy the demand created by that development approval and shall be assured by a legally binding development agreement between the school board the city and the applicant the development agreement shall be executed prior to the issuance of the applicable subdivision plat site plan or functional equivalent in the development review process c the student generation formula used for calculating mitigation shall be as follows number of student stations by school type   number of dwelling units by housing type  student generation multiplier by housing type and school type  student generation multipliers shall be based upon the best available data and professionally accepted methodology as presented in the supporting data and analysis of the comprehensive plan public school facilities element d for purposes of this cost per student station estimates shall include at a minimum all costs of providing instructional and core capacity including land site improvements design buildings equipment furniture and costs of financing if applicable the capital costs associated with transportation of students shall not be included in the cost per student station estimate used for mitigation e the proportionate mitigation share amount shall be calculated as follows proportionate share amount   number of student stations by school type  cost per student station by school type  the above formula shall be calculated for each housing type within the proposed development and for each school type elementary middle high for which a capacity deficiency has been identified the sum of these calculations shall be the proportionate share amount for the development under review f if the school district agrees to the mitigation the school district must commit to adding the improvement required for mitigation to its work plan and the city shall amend its capital improvements elementcapital improvements schedule to adopt the school boards revised work program 3 the applicants total proportionateshare mitigation obligation to resolve a capacity deficiency shall be based on the following formula for each public school type elementary middle high magnet a multiply the number of new student stations required to serve the new development by the cost per student station as estimated pursuant to subsection 2 above b the applicants proportionateshare mitigation obligation will be credited toward any other impact fee or exaction imposed by local ordinance for the same need 4 mitigation negotiation period a if within 90 days of the date the applicant initiates the mitigation negotiation period the applicant and the school district are able to agree to an acceptable form of mitigation a legally binding mitigation agreement shall be executed by the applicant and the school district together with the city which sets forth the terms of the mitigation including such issues as the amount nature and timing of donations construction or funding to be provided by the developer and any other matters necessary to effectuate mitigation in accordance with the citys comprehensive plan and this mitigation agreement shall specify the amount and timing of any impact fee credits or reimbursements if any that the developer expects to receive
