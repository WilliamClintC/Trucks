florida a county in central florida matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this article and other matters and documents relating to all of the above  the city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state of florida 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less that one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains in a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections b1 15 and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and works as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct with this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printed material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments

commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities

subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring their families to visit our community and who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other

solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or

findings a palm coast is a 42000 acre planned development situated in coastal plain flatwoods prior to its development the land was actively managed for southern pine timber production timber management included the periodic use of prescribed burns to control vegetative fuel buildup b palm coast has a densely developed core in which homes have been built sporadically throughout the development prescribed fires are no longer used for timber management c in may 198 a wildfire burned city destroying 100 homes and damaging 200 others a study conducted by the florida division of forestry concluded that fire crowning in the pine tree canopy a buildup of brush within 30 feet of a residential structure and a general buildup of fuels from decaying vegetation significantly correlated to the destruction or damage of a residential structure d in the summer of 1998 a devastating wildfire again burned city due to drought and the accumulation of brush destroying and damaging many homes and community infrastructure the same factors were associated with increased fire losses e fighting fires in the intermix between pine plantation timberlands and rural residential development requires different fire suppression strategies and equipment relying on suppression may not be reliable because it is a minor component in determining the loss of property more important factors are weather conditions vegetation structural characteristics and accessibility f many homeowners and landowners do not or cannot adopt mitigation measures such as brush clearance and fire resistant roofing material public education is hampered because the city has a very rapid rate of population growth and a number of the homes in the community are only seasonally occupied g state law authorizes the florida division of forestry to conduct prescribed burns as a mitigation measure on private lands such prescribed burning however is of limited utility because of the spreading and scattering of new homes being built in the pine plantation h to further promote hazard mitigation the city is required to exercise its power in coordination with the state of florida division of forestry to address wildfire hazard mitigation effective hazard mitigation to address the evolution of the citys development from a pine plantation to a residential community includes selective mowing of brush where prescribed burning is not adequate or feasible i the state division of forestry and the city have the capability to identify areas that have a relatively severe risk of wildfire hazard and to prioritize those areas for systematic mitigation planning and implementation j such systematic mitigation measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic loss to the community economically and in the quality of life k such systematic mitigation to the extent it limits wildfire damage also will help the community conserve its natural resources for aesthetic environmental and stormwater management purposes l the risk of wildfire recurrence is substantial under expected climatic conditions weather patterns associated with increased fire activity are a part of the el ninola nina southern oscillation phenomena that the city can expect to experience on a recurring basis as southern pacific sea surface temperatures drop fire activity in florida increases  41701 definitions as

unconstitutional or invalid such decision shall not affect the validity of this ldc as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid nonconformities  intent it is the intent of this chapter to permit lots structures uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before the effective date of a provision of this ldc but

be enlarged upon expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district  nonconforming lots a nonconforming in size when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming b nonconforming in setbacks when development on a nonconforming lot cannot reasonably comply to setback requirements due to the lot size limitation the land use administrator may grant an administrative deviation of standards see  from the applicable setback requirements if 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed without such deviations compliance is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonable 2 the deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health and safety c applicable to undeveloped lots only this section applies only

provisions of this subsection provided however that this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other lots to create conforming lots but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the rest of the neighborhood  nonconforming uses where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ldc a lawful use of land

zoning district development standards requesting a rezoning to the master planned development district is a voluntary process commenced by an applicant proposing a master plan for a unique individually planned development which would not otherwise be permitted in any of the zoning districts established by this chapter an application for rezoning to a master planned development district shall show that the planned development will produce a functional enduring and desirable environment with no significant adverse impacts to adjacent properties a purpose the purpose of the master planned development district is to provide opportunities for innovative planning and design although greater flexibility is given within this district procedures are established in this subsection to ensure that master planned developments are consistent with sound and generally accepted land development practices and that added benefit is accrued to the community approval of a master planned development agreement will be based on the finding that the submittal results in one or more of the following 1 a recognizable and material benefit to the ultimate users of the project and to the community where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved without application of the master planned development zoning approval  andor 2 longterm protection and preservation of natural resources and natural features of a significant quantity andor quality where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved without application of the master planned development zoning approval b intent the intent of the master planned development district is to 1 encourage efficient land development use of innovative land use planning 2 encourage a more compatible and harmonious development of contiguous lands 3 permit the combining and coordinating of architectural styles building forms and building relationships within a development 4 provide for the planning review and approval of one or a combination of residential commercial industrial recreational and public land uses and structures that results in an organized development 5 minimize infrastructure costs more efficient arrangement of structures utilities onsite circulation ingress and egress than is permitted under conventional zoning and subdivision regulations 6 preserve to the greatest extent feasible environmental assets and natural amenities such as scenic and functional open space areas 7 establish specific limitations and requirements in excess of those included in other zoning districts based on the unique characteristics of the individual site where necessary for the protection of the public health safety or welfare or for the protection or preservation of lands either internal or external to the planned development c general requirements 1 comprehensive plan consistency the master planned development shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan a master planned development district is allowed within all comprehensive plan future land use map categories 2 other ordinances all building and housing codes of the city are applicable to the master planned development district  however requirements for dimensional standards parking open space and other land use regulations established in the master planned development plan may differ from those specific to the zoning district in which the development is located to achieve a higher level of quality special exceptions and variances are therefore not applicable to master planned development plans d permitted uses densities and intensities all principal and accessory uses permitted within the master planned development district as provided for in tables 32 and 34 are subject to approval by the city council based on consistency with the comprehensive plan and compatibility with the surrounding areas the maximum gross residential density or nonresidential intensity permitted within any proposed master planned development shall not exceed the density or intensity permitted within the comprehensive plan future land use map category where the particular master planned development is proposed e development standards all development standards including but not limited to lot sizes setbacks lot coverage building height lighting architecture landscaping recreation and open space shall be specified in the master planned development agreement f compatibility standards in order to ensure compatibility of the master planned development the following shall apply whenever the proposed development abuts a singlefamily detached residentially zoned development 1 residential lot arrangement at the master planned development property lines including width depth and area shall

height adjacent to residential zoning districts shall comply with the requirements of  nonresidential delivery and loading areas dumpsters and mechanical equipment shall be located away from property lines abutting residential areas 4 development shall be generally consistent with the architectural design regulations contained in g perimeter buffer requirement whenever a master planned development abuts existing developments with lower density or intensity land uses the city council may impose perimeter buffer requirements in excess of the minimum requirements established in in order to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses including but not limited to 1 structures buildings and streets located at the perimeter of the development shall be permanently screened in a manner that sufficiently protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent existing uses 2 increased setbacks from the perimeter line may be imposed to protect privacy of adjacent existing uses h vehicular and pedestrian access and parking the master planned development shall be designed in a way that integrates pedestrian bicycle and vehicular traffic circulation systems into the surrounding community the development shall provide for safe and convenient access to public uses common areas and other community services facilities and activities located both within the proposed development and beyond its boundaries 1 all uses within the master planned development shall have access to a public street either directly or indirectly via a private approach road pedestrian way court or other area dedicated

parking and loading shall be provided in general conformance with regulations established in however the minimum number of parking spaces required may be modified based on evidence that other standards would be more reasonable a decision to reduce the number of parking spaces shall be based on technical information provided by a qualified consultant that verifies the reduction will not impair the functioning of the development or adjacent developments i open space requirement a master planned development shall give priority to preservation and interconnection of wildlife corridors and wildlife preservation areas including below grade crossings if necessary open space should to the maximum extent possible preserve the most important environmental features on the site in their natural state or restrict these areas for passive outdoor recreational purposes only master planned developments within a development of regional impact are exempt from the open space requirements of this section provided that the master planned development must comply and be consistent with the development of regional impact development order 1 minimum required open space a master planned development shall be required to provide open space totaling 40 percent of its gross area for a development with residential uses at least 25 percent of the total required open space shall be common

open space parks bike paths or pedestrian paths  c provide natural greenbelts along roadways  and d buffer adjacent land uses where appropriate 2 open space requirement flexibility as an alternative to meeting the open space percentage noted above an applicant may propose alternative solutions such as but not limited to green building principles land donation or other mechanisms that would justify the lower percentage 3 permitted uses of open space for the purpose of this section open space does not equate to pervious areas therefore the following uses as permitted within the required open space area a pervious areas including but not limited to conservation of natural archeological and historical resources  and woodlands wetlands ponds lakes wildlife corridors landscape and

parks pools recreation centers or other facilities shall be constructed in conjunction with residential dwellings such facilities shall be completed at a rate equal to that which is capable of serving the number of completed residential units in the master planned development therefore no more than 40 percent of the units for which the improvements are intended shall receive building permits until the improvements are completed b public improvements must be backed by performance bonds issued to the city in a form and quantity acceptable to the land use administrator the land use administrator must approve the bond prior to the issuance of the first residential permit c improvements may be completed in phases as long as the capacity of the improvement is capable of serving the associated phase of development 6 conveyance and preservation of open space open space shall be preserved in perpetuity based upon the type of space and the user as follows a common open space proposed for use of the master planned development owners and residents shall be conveyed to a homeowners association or to a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the conservation of open space to a

imposed the land uses permitted within the underlying zoning districts remain undisturbed by the creation of the overlay zone  wetland overlay zone a purpose the purpose of the wetland overlay zone is to designate areas within the city containing significant wetland areas b delineation of wetland overlay zone boundaries the wetland overlay zone boundaries delineate areas in which aerial maps the future land use map or other sources of conceptual wetland mapping information indicate that the subject parcel or lot appears to meet at least one of the following conditions 1 more than 50 percent of the land area within the parcel or lot contains wetlands as defined and protected under  the parcel or lot contains wetlands that are part of a protected environmental or resource corridor or an integrated nonisolated wetland system 3 the location of the wetlands on the parcel or lot is situated in such a manner that the propertys future development may be substantially restricted c restrictions to future development within a wetland overlay zone although the wetland overlay zone designation is an indication that a propertys future development may be restricted due to the presence of wetlands the designation itself does not entail any specific development regulations upon determination of the jurisdictional wetlands boundary by the st johns river water management district or other government designated entities and the application of the parcel or lot is permitted to develop in accordance with the prescribed standards of its zoning district d preserved wetland areas preserved wetland areas may be used on a parcel or lot to meet setback requirements to provide credit toward meeting landscape requirements and to provide pervious area twentyfive percent of preserved wetland areas may count in the gross acreage used to calculate residential density in accordance with e wetlands impacts the wetland overlay zone designation neither precludes impacts to wetlands nor does it provide justification for wetland impacts contains the citys regulations regarding wetland impacts  gateway overlay zone a purpose the purpose of the gateway overlay zone is to

fees shall be required to be assessed and paid as a condition of receiving a building permit pursuant to the impact fee rate schedules in effect at the time a building permit is issued however each facility reservation fee previously paid shall be credited towards the corresponding impact fee as a per unit fixeddollar deduction from the applicable impact fees at the time of building permit issuance 2 for reservation of roadway capacity applicants may select to reserve capacity for a fixed period of time the periods of time being from one year to three years with associated scaling based on amount of the reservation fees paid the scaling amount to be paid to secure the reservation would be 33% of total impact fee amount for oneyear reservation period  67% of total impact fee amount for twoyear reservation period  100% of total impact fee amount for threeyear reservation period the developer shall be required to pay the remainder of the required total impact fee amount due at the time of and as a condition to receiving a building permit the scaled reservation fees paid previously shall be credited toward the impact fee in effect at the time of the building permit and shall be on a dollarfordollar basis 3 for water and sewer services the facility reservation fee shall be an amount equivalent to the then applicable capacity fees and on the basis of the rates then in effect

subject to required permits all water and sewer reservations of capacity shall be subject to the issuance of all required permits from the florida department of environmental protection and any other applicable agencies e vested developments if a development is vested under this chapter the requirements relating to the payment of impact fees and connection fees shall fully apply if the payment of connection fees for water and sewer service is required to reserve capacity such payment must occur vested status does not guarantee the availability of water or sewer capacity  expiration reservations of a certificate of concurrency shall run with the life of the development order unless otherwise noted in reservation of capacities  cease and continuance if a public facility to be provided by an applicant is not available at the time of the developments impacts further development shall cease until all required public facilities are constructed if a public facility to be provided by an applicant is included in a binding contract but the construction is behind schedule development may continue but no releases for final electrical service or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until the facility has been accepted or approved by the city if however a public facility is to be provided by the city and is not completed on time development may continue within the

impacts of development on transportation facilities by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors and shall be known as the proportionate fairshare program  applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that impact a road segment or intersection in the concurrency management system including transportation facilities maintained by florida department of transportation or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency review and that have been notified that a failure to achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment segments or intersections exists the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments meeting the de minimis standards under fs  6 or to developments exempted from concurrency  general requirements a an applicant may propose satisfying the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements 1 the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and this land development the 5year capital improvement program includes transportation improvements that upon completion will mitigate additional traffic generated by the proposed development as determined by the land use administrator and in accordance with the proportionate fairshare statute b the land use administrator may determine to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will mitigate the impact of additional traffic generated by the proposed development as projected by city staff using best available data and methodologies but is not contained in the capital improvement program where one of the following apply 1 the city adopts by resolution or ordinance a commitment to add the improvements to the next 5year capital improvement program no later than the next regular update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the land use administrator and must be determined to be financially feasible financially feasible means that additional developer contributions payments or other funding sources are anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate the specified impacts on the identified transportation facility or facilities and in accordance with the proportionate fairshare statute 2 if the land use administrator determines that the funds in the capital improvement program are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system then a proportionate fairshare payment may be required for another improvement which will as determined by the land use administrator significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component shall be adopted into the next 5year capital improvement program at the next annual capital improvement element update c any improvement project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet generally accepted design standards applicable for the florida department of transportation maintained roadways andor city maintained roadways whichever is applicable  application process a the land use administrator shall notify an applicant in writing if a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements occurs upon receipt of such notice an applicant may submit a proposed proportionate fairshare calculation to the land use administrator for review b pursuant to fs  16e proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires the concurrence of the florida department of transportation improvements to nonstrategic intermodal system florida department of transportation maintained roadways shall likewise require florida department of transportation review and approval c the land use administrator shall determine whether a proportionate fairshare calculation is sufficient and eligible and is consistent with professionally accepted engineering practices upon a finding of sufficiency a proportionateshare agreement will be prepared between the city and the applicant the agreement shall include but not be limited to the amount of payment description of work estimated construction costs using the projected future cost of the improvement and data and the timing of payment all proportionateshare agreements are subject to approval by the city council  determining proportionate fairshare obligation a proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include but are not limited to separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction or contribution of transportation improvements b a development shall be required to pay only its proportionate fairshare

all improvements and associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred  impact fee credits   used where applicable more specifically impact fee credits for the proportionate fairshare obligation will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced based on the proportionate fairshare agreement as they become due according to this the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of the development under review then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the impact fee code any impact fee paid in excess of the impact fee obligation for the proposed development may be applied to the calculated proportionateshare amount d for the purposes of determining proportionateshare obligations the land use administrator shall determine improvement costs based upon the projected future cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvement program or another method approved by the land use administrator cost for florida department of transportation facilities shall be based upon florida department of transportation cost estimates e the city may accept rightsofway dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be assigned a value by land use administrator or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the land use administrator prepared at no expense to the city 1 at the option of the applicant the reimbursement is to be based on either the assessed value of the proffered land based on the most recent appraisal by the flagler county property appraiser or the fair market value of the land as determined by a certified property appraiser hired and paid for by the applicant if the latter option is chosen and the city rejects the applicants appraisal the city may hire and pay for a second appraiser to appraise the property if either party rejects the second appraisal a third appraisal may be performed by an appraiser chosen by the first and second appraisers the costs of which are to be shared equally by the city and the applicant the third appraisal is binding to both parties all appraisals must be consistent with generally accepted appraisal techniques and the date of valuation must be the proposed date of transfer to the city 2 the applicant shall supply to the city a survey and legal description of the land and a certificate of title search of the land at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant shall also pay or provide for mitigation of the difference  impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation a transportation impact fees shall be applied as a credit against proportionate fairshare mitigation only if the proposed improvement is on the list of approved projects in the current 5year capital improvement program or as amended by the next regular update or in the first five years of the current 10year capital improvement program and the citys impact fee program credits may also be given to proposed improvement that will be incorporated into the next or following 5year capital improvement program impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicants proportionateshare obligation is calculated b any transportation impact fee credit based upon proportionate fairshare contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the city  appropriation of fairshare revenues a proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the capital improvement program b in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the capital improvement program then the revenues collected for
