centers iv presence of signal interference due to masses of trees topography or other obstructions v other specific reasons creating the need for the facility in the specific location being proposed 6 colocation of additional antennas on existing transmission towers a colocation requirements it is the policy of the city to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the city and to encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facilities if a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or controlled by it where colocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be required in contradiction with this policy colocation shall be required unless an applicant demonstrates that colocation is not feasible colocation shall be deemed feasible for the purpose of this all of the following are met 1 the wireless communication provider or property owner where colocation is proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for colocation and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates 2 the site on which colocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support general provisions city of midland zoning  33 3 the colocation being considered is technically reasonable eg the colocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure antennas and the like new transmission towers shall be designed to accommodate colocation of additional

shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible colocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed to accommodate colocation c penalties for not permitting colocation the policy of the community is for colocation if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible colocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect in addition if a party refuses to allow colocation in accordance with the intent of the article and this action results in construction of a new tower the city may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from the party for a period of up to five 5 years such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the fiveyear prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of

communication facility is not available for the coverage and capacity e antennae which are attached to an existing tower are encouraged to minimize the adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers colocation of antennas by more than one 1 carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers provided such colocation is
