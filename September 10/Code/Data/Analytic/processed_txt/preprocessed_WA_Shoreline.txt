allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas ctype location and timing of mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning or greater reduction of hazard risk would result from an alternative approach or as otherwise allowed in this chapter mitigation for adverse impacts shall be based on best available science and shall be inkind onsite and prior to the activities that will disturb the critical area mitigation measures that cannot be implemented prior to the critical area impacts shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora 1the director may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties eg project delay lapses past a fisheries window or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety or general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay must include

according to the following requirements 1a buffer may be applied to the restored portion of the stream or wetland that is not less than 75 percent of the standard buffer associated with the type of stream or category of wetland  or 2the project proponent may request a reduced buffer of between 50 percent and 75 percent of the standard buffer associated with the type of stream or category of wetland the following criteria will be used by the city in reviewing the request for a reduced buffer athe director determines that applying a 50 percent to 75 percent buffer would significantly limit the use of the property for existing or permitted uses thus making the restoration project infeasible  bthe proposed buffer relief is the minimum necessary to achieve the restoration project  cthere will be a net environmental benefit from the restoration project with the reduced buffer  dgranting the proposed relief is consistent with the objectives of the critical area restoration project and

within a watershed formal washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol  or 2outofkind replacement of wetland type or functions and values will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types cpreference of mitigation actions methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions and values shall be approached in the following order of preference 1restoration restoration of wetlands 2creation creation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species this should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design 3enhancement enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation enhancement alone will result in a loss of wetland acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions and values lost enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements 4preservation preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration creation or enhancement  provided that a minimum of  acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met awetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish or other esalisted species  bthere is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin  cmitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at  specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost  dthe impact area is small generally less than onehalf acre andor impacts are occurring to a lowfunctioning system category iii or iv wetland  and eall preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation dtype and location of compensatory mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in kind and on site or in kind and within the same stream reach subbasin or drift cell if estuarine wetlands are impacted compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply 1there are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include aanticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation  bbuffer conditions and proposed widths  cavailable water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored  and dproposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  2offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland  3offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  and 4the design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland an atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland eg created or enhanced that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site ie the water sources and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting likewise it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water for example excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope which would require the construction of berms to hold the water ewetland mitigation ratios1 table g wetland mitigation ratios

functions compensatory mitigation shall address the shoreline ecological functions and the wetland or wetland buffer functions and values affected by the proposed project with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions and values the goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar shoreline ecological functions and wetland functions and values as those lost except when either 1the lost wetland provides minimal functions and values and the proposed compensatory mitigation actions will provide equal or greater functions and values or will provide functions and values shown to be limiting within a watershed formal washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol  or 2outofkind replacement of wetland type or functions and values will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types cpreference of mitigation actions methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions and values shall be approached in the following order of preference 1restoration restoration of wetlands 2creation creation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species this should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design 3enhancement enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation enhancement alone will result in a loss of wetland acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions and values lost enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements 4preservation preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration creation or enhancement  provided that a minimum of  acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met awetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish or other esalisted species  bthere is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin  cmitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at  specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost  dthe impact area is small generally less than onehalf acre andor impacts are occurring to a lowfunctioning system category iii or iv wetland  and eall preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation dtype and location of compensatory mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in kind and on site or in kind and within the same stream reach subbasin or drift cell if estuarine wetlands are impacted compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply 1there are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include aanticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation  bbuffer conditions and proposed widths  cavailable water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored  and dproposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  2offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland  3offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  and 4the design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland an atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland eg created or enhanced that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site ie the water sources and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting likewise it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water for example excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope which would require the construction of berms to hold the water ewetland

floodplain management the following policies and regulations must be factored into decisions regarding all flood management planning and development within that portion of the 100year floodplain that falls within shorelines shoreline jurisdiction within 200 feet of ohwm floodplain management involves actions taken with the primary purpose of preventing or mitigating damage due to flooding floodplain management can involve planning and zoning to control development either to reduce risks to human life and property or to prevent development from contributing to the severity of flooding floodplain management can also address the design of developments to reduce flood damage and the construction of flood controls such as dikes dams engineered floodways and bioengineering apolicy 1flood management planning should be undertaken in a coordinated manner among affected property owners and public agencies and should consider the entire coastal system this planning should consider offsite impacts such as erosion accretion andor flood damage that might occur if shore protection structures are constructed 2nonstructural control solutions are preferred over structural flood control devices and should be used wherever possible when control devices are needed nonstructural controls include such actions as prohibiting or limiting development in areas that are historically flooded or limiting increases in peak flow runoff from new upland development structural solutions to reduce shoreline damage should be allowed only after it is demonstrated that nonstructural solutions would not be able to reduce the damage 3substantial stream channel modification realignment and straightening should be discouraged as a means of flood protection 4where possible public access should be integrated into the design of publicly financed flood management facilities exh b 2019  flood hazard  description and purpose aa flood hazard area consists of the special flood hazard areas and protected areas as defined in smc floodplain management which comprise the regulatory floodplain bit is the purpose of smc regulations to ensure that the city meets the requirements of the national flood insurance program and maintains the city as an eligible community for federal flood insurance benefits exh b 2019  flood hazard  development limitations development occurring within the

aaquifer recharge areas consist of areas that provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream discharge during periods of low flow as defined in smc bthe primary purpose of aquifer recharge area regulations is to protect aquifer recharge areas by providing for regulation of land use activities that pose a risk of potential aquifer contamination and to minimize impacts application of strict performance standards exh b 2019  aquifer recharge  designation and classification aaquifer recharge areas shall be designated and classified based on the soil and ground water conditions and risks to surface water during periods of low hydrology classification depends on the combined effects of hydrogeological susceptibility to contamination and contaminant loading potential and includes upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of silt clay or glacial till upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel wellhead protection areas and areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel in which there is a predominantly downward or lateral component to ground water flow bat the time of adoption of the amendments to the critical areas of
