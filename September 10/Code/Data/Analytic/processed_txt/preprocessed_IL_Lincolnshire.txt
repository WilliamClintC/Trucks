structures anticipated by the codes of the village and the installation of satellite earth station antennas may not be compatible with existing structures and land uses in the village the appearance of this sesa from neighboring properties and the removal of desirable vegetation to allow placement of the sesa are major negative consequences of such systems in addition it is extremely important
