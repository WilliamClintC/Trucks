districts as shown graphically on the official zoning map these classes of districts together with the general objectives for establishing each are as follows a conservation a district this district includes land that is used for recreation municipal or educational purposes which if used intensively would unduly harm the public health safety andor welfare much of this land is on steep slopes subject to landslides and excessive siltation of streams and in floodplains development of these areas would alter drainage patterns create severe erosion problems and damage to downstream areas as well as endangering human lives and property affected by such development the publicly owned areas in particular help to establish an open space network relieving the patterns of more intense development surrounding them all the areas are significant in enabling the township council to fulfill its responsibilities under s 27 of the constitution of pennsylvania recognizing that in a few instances the primary uses for this district may not provide a reasonable economic use of particular property some conditional uses are provided for it is the intent that within this conservation district such conditional uses be limited strictly to prevent building on steep slopes where landslides or excessive erosion and sedimentation of streams are likely to result or in floodplains subject to onehundredyear base flood or where the values protected by s 27 of the constitution of pennsylvania will be harmed see  31032 b conservation b district this district includes land that is held in large tracts as estates as farms or as privately owned outdoor recreation areas see  31033 c residential a district this district includes land that has already been or may be developed into residential lots of one acre or greater in area and adjacent or nearby land whose location and character suggest large lot development as the highest and best use see  31034 d residential b district

to public utilities major roads and community facilities these areas suggest development for lots of medium size and compatible residential development or supporting facilities such as schools playgrounds and churches see  31035 e residential c district this district includes land of exceptional opportunity for residential development because of unusual proximity  31028 charter  31028 c663  31029 overlay districts to major highways public utilities and community facilities and therefore offers the best location for a relatively denser pattern of singlefamily lots and multifamily development see  31036 f residential d district this district includes land where multifamily residential dwelling units in conjunction with certain limited commercial uses are likely to occur this district is developed to provide a variety of dwelling types within the township this district offers the best locations for higherdensity development with access to arterial roads including structures which combine certain commercial uses with apartments as well as providing for a buffer area between heavier developed commercial zones and residential districts as such development is limited to those uses expressly permitted see  31037 g highway commercial district this district includes land abutting major traffic arteries that has developed or is well suited for sales and service activities that normally require a market greater than the township to succeed see  31038 h highway commercial pnrd overlay district this district encompasses the highway commercial zoning district from wildwood road to the townships northern border see b i neighborhood commercial district this district includes strategically located land at crossroads of important local streets these areas have developed or may be developed for commercial activities that support the daily needs of residential neighborhoods in the vicinity see  31039 j light industrial district this district includes land in large relatively flat parcels with good highway access and available utilities that have been developed or may be developed by light manufacturing or similar industryoriented uses that are compatible neighbors in a basically residential community see  31040 k heavy industrial district this district includes land that is insulated from residential development has access to railroad transportation andor arterial roads and that have been developed or may be developed for heavy manufacturing uses see  31041 l office research and development district this district includes land still in large parcels that has access to arterial roads is fairly level and acts as a buffer between adjacent residential areas and nearby downgrading influences such as heavily traveled highways or industrial operations uses that will be least disruptive to residential areas are permitted in this district a stormwater management overlay districts  31028 hampton code  31029 c664

expressly authorized by the provisions of the development plan modify remove or release their rights to enforce the provisions of the development plan but no such action shall affect the right of the township to enforce the provisions of the development plan in accordance with the provisions of this section a conservation subdivisions for singlefamily detached homes duplexes and quadraplexes will be a permitted alternative to the conventional residential subdivision requiring full half or oneacre lots conservation subdivisions will allow for greater flexibility in design layout and an opportunity to preserve environmentally sensitive lands and to create more usable open space in the township for recreation purposes b in this type of residential development the overall site plan and the quantity and quality of the open space are of prime importance innovative design is the key  therefore variations in minimum lot sizes minimum yard setbacks or maximum lot coverage requirements may be submitted to township council as a modification request to table a153 requirements with the subdivision application requirements include calculating the maximum density and for the preservation and protection of the open space accessory structuresuses shall meet the requirements set forth in table a and other specific requirements of this chapter c a minimum of 10 acres is required for a conservation subdivision and shall be limited to ra and rb zoning districts a determining density 1 estimating the permitted density shall be based on the mathematical formula listed below 2 all land classified as inherently unbuildable wetlands onehundred year floodplains and slopes exceeding 25% shall be deducted from the site area a further 10% shall be deducted from that net area to allow for land required for new streets thus producing a new net acreage area which is rounded up to the next whole acre number this number of acres is then divided by the minimum allowable lot area for the zoning district in which the site is located as set forth in table a of this chapter154 on sites not served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility soil suitability for

interest rate of 5% the amount designated for the endowment fund should be 20 times the amount estimated to be required on a yearly basis to maintain the open space on the assumption that additional dwellings over and above the maximum that would ordinarily be permitted on the site are net of development costs and represent true profit 75% of the selling price of the lots shall be donated to the open space endowment fund for the preserved lands within the subdivision such estimates shall be prepared by an agency or organization with experience in open space management acceptable to the planning commission and the environmental advisory council this fund shall be transferred by the developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance responsibilities such as a homeowners association a land trust or the township c density bonus for public access dedication of land for public use including trails active recreation etc in addition to the 10% public land dedication required under other provisions of this chapter may be encouraged by the township council who are authorized to offer a density bonus for this express purpose the density bonus for open space that would be in addition to the 10% public land dedication that may also be required shall be computed on the basis of a maximum of one dwelling unit per five acres of publicly accessible open space the decision whether to accept an applicants offer to dedicate open space for public access shall be at the discretion of the township council who shall be guided by the environmental advisory council and

further subdivision permanent conservation easement in a form acceptable to the township and duly recorded in the county register of deeds office  at least 25% of the minimum required 40% open space shall be suitable for active recreation purposes and no more than 50% shall be utilized for that purpose in order to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural areas on the site the purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant e location of open space 1 the location of open space conserved residential development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the open space and recreation element of the townships comprehensive and recreationopen space plan and with recommendations contained in designing open space subdivisions a practical stepbystep approach by randall arendt mrtpi published by natural lands trust september 1994  31053 charter  31053 c719 2 open space shall be comprised of two types of land primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas all lands within both primary and secondary conservation areas are required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting further development and setting other standards safeguarding the sites special resources from negative changes primary and secondary conservation areas shall also be considered as environmentally critical lands a primary conservation areas the first category consists of wetlands land within the onehundredyear floodplain slopes exceeding 25% and soils subject to slumping these environmentally sensitive resources form the core of the open space that is required to be protected b secondary conservation area  in addition to the primary conservation areas at least 40% of the remaining land shall be designated and permanently protected fulldensity credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local state and federal regulations so that their development potential is not reduced by this designation such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site  although the location of primary conservation areas are predetermined by the locations of floodplains wetlands steep slopes and soils subject to slumping greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary conservation areas except that they shall include a fiftyfoot deep greenway buffer along all banks of water bodies and watercourses and a fiftyfoot greenway buffer alongside wetland soils  the location of secondary conservation areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in the open space and recreation element of the townships comprehensive plan and typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources mature woodlands aquifer recharge areas areas with highly permeable excessively drained soil significant wildlife habitat areas sites listed on the pennsylvania natural diversity inventory the allegheny county natural heritage inventory the hampton township natural areas inventory prime farmland historic archaeological or cultural features listed or eligible to be listed on national state or county registers or inventories and scenic views into the property from existing public roads  31053 hampton code  31053 c720  although the resource lands listed as potential secondary conservation areas may comprise more than half of the remaining land on a development parcel after primary conservation areas have been deducted no applicant shall be required to designate more than 50% of that remaining land as a secondary conservation area c general location standards subdivisions and planned residential developments prds shall be designed around both the primary and secondary conservation areas which together constitute the total required open space the design process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential open space after which potential house sites are located following that access road alignments are identified with lot lines being drawn in as the final step this fourstep design process is further described below  both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be placed in undivided preserves which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development  undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the residents of the development to achieve this the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance where the undivided open space is designated as separate noncontiguous parcels no parcel shall consist of less than three acres in area nor have a lengthtowidth ratio in excess of  except such areas that are specifically designed as village greens ballfields upland buffers to wetlands water bodies or watercourses or designed as trail links d interconnected open space network as these policies are implemented the protected open space in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the township to avoid the issue of the taking of land without compensation the only elements of this network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been required to be dedicated for public use never more than 10% of a development parcels gross acreage and typically configured in a linear fashion as an element of the townships longrange open space network  31053 charter  31053 c721 f evaluation criteria in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission and the environmental advisory council as indicating a design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this chapter diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas accordingly the planning commission and the environmental advisory council shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan 1 protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the township for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities 2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows or orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses 3 if development is located on open fields or pastures dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers 4 maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 50 feet in depth adjacent to all eddies andor banks of wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds 5 minimizes impacts on woodlands and wooded areas especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive vines however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable 6 leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public roadways for example in open agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation  31053 hampton code  31053 c722 7 avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features 8 protects wildlife habitat and biodiversity areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the united states environmental protection agency by the pennsylvania natural diversity inventory by the allegheny county natural heritage inventory or the hampton township natural areas inventory 9 designs around and preserves sites of historic archaeological or cultural value and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature 10 protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads 11 landscapes common areas such as community greens culdesac islands and both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value 12 provides active recreational areas if desired in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents and adequately screened from nearby house lots 13 includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside footpaths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels where applicable 14 provides open space that is reasonably contiguous for example fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems as per the policies in the open space and recreation element of the townships comprehensive plan g uses permitted in primary conservation lands 1 conservation of open land in its natural state  31053 charter  31053 c723 2 passive recreation such as hiking nonmotorized biking on an established trail bird watching and picnicking only 3 buffer yards along tract boundaries 4 easements for drainage access sewer or water lines or other public purposes 5 underground utility and street rightsofway may traverse

landscaped and available for use as an integral part of the greenway the acreage of land for these uses will not be credited toward the minimum open space acreage requirements unless the land is still appropriate for passive recreational use such as a retention pond which always holds water 7 neighborhood uses such as village greens commons picnic areas community gardens trails and similar lowimpact recreation uses specifically excluding motorized offroad vehicles or bikes rifle ranges and other uses similar in character and potential impact as determined by the township council 8 active noncommercial recreation areas such as playing fields playgrounds swimming pools courts and bikeways provided such areas do not consume more than half of the minimum required slc greenway land or five acres whichever is less playing fields playgrounds pools and courts shall not be located within 100 feet of abutting properties parking facilities for the same shall also be permitted and they
