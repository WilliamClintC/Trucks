development and execution of this title is based upon the division of the city into districts within which districts the uses of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform it is recognized however that there are special uses which because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location such special uses fall into two 2 categories 1 uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest  and 2 uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities b initiation of special use any person having a freehold interest in land or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable may file an

twenty 20 percent of the frontage immediately adjoining the property proposed for a special use or by owners of twenty 20 percent of the frontage across the alley or directly opposite therefrom such special use shall not be granted except by a favorable vote of threefourths of the city council f standards no special use shall be recommended by the zoning board of appeals unless such board shall find 1 that the establishment maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health safety morals comfort or general welfare  2 that the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood  3 that the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district  4 that adequate utilities access roads drainage andor necessary facilities have been or are being provided  5 that adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets  6 that the special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the city council pursuant to the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals  7 that where it is found a use not otherwise acceptable to the neighborhood in which located would be acceptable with certain conditions of use operation and improvement the zoning board of appeals may recommend and the council may require the granting of such nonconforming special use

properties d requirements for access lanes and parking areas to protect pedestrian safety e restraint on signage so as to be compatible with surrounding properties f limitation on outdoor storage g where any site plan expansion is proposed h any other such requirements which in the opinion of the zoning board of appeals or council would render the use compatible with surrounding properties g termination of special uses any special use authorized by the city council shall be deemed to have automatically terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following 1 except with respect to a planned development special use the failure to establish the special use within one year after authority to establish the special use is granted by the city council 2 with respect to a planned development special use the failure to abide by time limits made applicable to such special use by action of the city council or by the city 3 after establishment of a special use the discontinuation of that use for a period of twelve 12 consecutive months 4 the violation of any condition stipulation or agreement placed upon the special use by the city council in the event that a special use authorized with respect to any parcel of property within the city is discontinued abandoned or terminated as provided in this section the only uses which may be established on that parcel are the permitted uses authorized under the zoning regulations applicable to that parcel or any special use authorized by the city council which has not been terminated discontinued or abandoned in accordance with the provisions of the city h effect of special use permit upon the authorization of any special use including a planned development special use with respect to a given parcel any person entitled
