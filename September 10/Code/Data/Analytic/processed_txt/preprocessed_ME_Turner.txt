architecture 161 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture architectural introduction turner encourages a greater sense of continuity and identity throughout its commercial and village areas by describing and illustrating high quality architectural design its comprehensive plan states that commercial development will be encouraged to have landscaping and trees pitched roofs and a new england village building character these standards are not intended to dictate building styles rather they establish criteria by which any new or renovated development can be compared with its surroundings architectural goals  new england villagescale architecture that is sited and designed to offer a positive experience to both pedestrians viewing the buildings up close and motorists on the highway  good neighborhood buildings that thoughtfully consider scale form orientation height setback massing materials and architectural features that will be consistent with the goals of the comprehensive plan  buildings that are designed as permanent positive additions to turner constructed of high quality long lasting materials  architecture that utilizes energy conservation measures wherever possible contents introduction 160 architectural principles 161 building materials 163 facade design 166 awnings & canopies 169 rooflines 170 renovations & additions 172 design of national franchises 173 large scale buildings 175 linear commercial buildings 177 service stations & convenience stores 179 drivethroughs 180 accessory structures 181 drawing from traditional forms the scale of this newcommercial building has been effectively reduced by variations in the massing wall projections and careful attention to detailing 162 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture architectural objectives the purpose of these guidelines is to encourage architectural forms that draws inspiration from traditional new england village examples eg cape cod federal classic revival etc and from local rural region architecture building design should be developed to a human scale consideration of architectural forms massing detailing number and use of materials and color design standards design design new buildings to fit the specific characteristics of their particular site the architecture should be influenced by traditional new england building forms and townmaking patterns the specific needs of the intended users the nature of the intended use and other sitespecific factors architectural styles contemporary architecture may be appropriate provided it is designed in accordance with these standards human scale design buildings and site elements to human scale the forms massing and openings of buildings should be proportional to the size of the human figure many architectural elements can add scale to a building  watertables planters recessed openings divided pane windows building mounted light fixtures dormers cupolas projecting rooflines covered walkways colonnades and similar features  provided they are designed as integral parts of the overall structure energy conscious design consider energy conservation and sustainability in the design and siting of all new and renovated buildings while leeds leader ship in energy and environmental design certification is not required developers are strongly urged to use the principles of sustainability and energy conservation this may be achieved by specifying proper insulation reduced lighting landscaping for windbreaks and shading recycled materials and a host of other appropriate techniques the maine uniform building & energy will be met examples of high quality contemporary maine architecture  a branch bank an office building and a library  that have been designed to fit their uniquesites 163 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture architectural many elements of new england architecture  pitched roof gable ends overhanging roof  are used in this attractive bank building an office supply store in a new shopping center the design ofall buildings feature pitched rooflines traditional materials and great attention to architectural detail this building pays little attention to the site where it is located nor gives much attention to detailing and the roofline flat roofs such as this are discouraged the themed design of this restaurant is out of character in a new england village setting 164 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture building objectives building materials should be treated as significant design elements that define the appearance of the structure design standards types of materials encouraged traditional highquality building materials common to northern new england eg brick clapboard shingles or other similar products should be used as the primary siding material contemporary materials that have the same visual characteristics as traditional materials eg cement plank clapboards or vinyl siding are acceptable if attention is paid to detailing eg corners trim at openings changes in material painted medium density overlay mdo plywood is acceptable as a secondary material when used in combination with traditional materials to give it scale consider long term maintenance in the selection of all building materials types of materials discouraged highly reflective or processed materials eg sheet metal or plastic panels brushed aluminum bronzed glass stucco or synthetic stucco exterior insulation and finish systems eifs adobe concrete block t111 untreated plywood particle board tiltup concrete panels and multicolored brick incorporating occasional white bricks in a random pattern should not be used as the primary facade material colors facade colors should be low reflectance high intensity high reflectance chrome metallic fluorescent colors or black should not be used on the primary building face trim where trim is used it should be a color that is similar or complementary to the buildings primary color detailing arbitrary changes in materials or embellishments that are not in keeping with the rest of the building are discouraged highly reflective surfaces and bright colors are notcharacteristic of traditional new england architecture this branch bank uses materials forms and details that are common to maine 165 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture building unacceptable building materials examples of materials that lack reference to traditional architectural styles and would not meet the design standards metal panels painted concrete block corrugated plastic panels split face block reflective metallic siding synthetic stucco exterior insulation and finish systems eifs 166 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture building acceptable building materials examples of the richness and variety of traditional new england materials and colors that would be appropriate to turner 167 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture facade objectives facades for new or renovated structures should provide visual interest from all accessible sides the windows doorways and architectural detailing should complement the buildings form and faade design standards entrances building entrances should be clearly visible from route 4 and other public streets and provide unobstructed areas for pedestrians design features such as canopies projecting rooflines integrated signage recesses patios lighting and landscaping can be used to reinforce the entrance street facades for retail structures any facade that faces public or private streets should have display windows entry areas or other transparent features as an alternative other features may be used to provide scale and visual interest to the front facade as long as they are integrated into the design of the building by color form materials and architectural design the facade treatment on this shop wraps around the corner to present a unified design from all visible faces the entrance is emphasized by columns and the lower roofline rear and side facades facades that are visible or potentially visible from adjacent properties should be designed to match or complement the architectural treatment of the front facade blank or unadorned walls should not face public roads abutting properties residential areas or other public viewpoints except when such wall faces a service area wall murals will be allowed if they are integrated into the facade of the building and done in a professional manner murals should not contain advertising maintenance of the painted surface should be considered in the placement and execution of the mural wall treatments facades should not extend for more than 50 feet in length without incorporating architectural features such as pilasters windows cornices porches or offsets where the plane of the wall is broken the offset should be proportional to the buildings height and length projections used to break up the mass of the building should extend to the ground site design signage lighting landscaping and other exterior elements should all be planned to complement the facade these elements should be coordinated with the architectural plans to avoid unnecessary conflicts and to retain the proper level ofvisibility functional elements all vents downspouts flashing electrical conduits meters hvac equipment service connections and other functional elements should be treated as integral parts of the architecture starting at the conceptual building design phase when these elements need to be part of the facade eg downspouts vents they should be incorporated into the architecture or matching colors meters utility banks hvac equipment and other exterior service elements should be located out of view from the public building elevations which show the location and treatment of all functional elements should be presented for planning board review details are critical to maintain longterm value plastic columns in this example are susceptible to snowplow damage bases are not flush with the pavement 168 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture architectural details architectural detailing and trim should be proportional to the scale and design of the entire building trim when in public view windows doors ventilation fixtures and other openings in frame construction should be trimmed to create a frame around the opening materials used for trim should match those used on the facade of the building shutters if shutters are used they should be sized to fit the openings and provided for all windows on a given wall illustrations elevations of proposed buildings should be presented with the application for design review the planning board may request perspectives of the building to illustrate the relationship between the front and side elevations elevation and perspective drawings should include all landscape elements trees shrubs lighting street furnishing signs etc that will be seen in conjunction with the facade facade the main entrance to this grocery store is emphasized bythe circular window brick banding gives visual support to the building while providing protection fromsnowplows hvac equipment and service connections are highly visible adding unnecessary clutter to this small restaurant architectural illustrations should be presented to give an understanding of how new development will fit into the surrounding area 169 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture three views of a branch bank set in a mixedresidential neighborhood all facades were treated with equalimportance the front top photo faces the street and is built to the sidewalk providing a welcoming presence to pedestrian traffic theside of the building middle photo facing a single family home is residential in scale and design the canopy over the rear entrance bottom photo provides a transition area between the parking lot and the doorway facade while the front plane of the wall of this building is broken the offset does not continue to the ground the projection becomes a billboard and the building is seen as a large box a similar building with a facade composed of new england forms and materials the overhang provides protection forpedestrians and emphasizes the entranceway the sign is over scaled ie too large for the facade 170 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture awnings and canopies objectives awnings and canopies can enhance the appearance and function of a building by providing shade shelter shadow patterns and visual interest where awnings are used they should complement the design materials color and appearance of the building design standards location when used fixed or retractable awnings and canopies should be an integral element of the architecture they should be located directly over windows or doors to provide protection from the elements materials awnings and canopies should be made of canvas or similar nonreflective material their color should be the same or complementary to the facade of the building design elements graphics used on awnings for identification or advertising should be designed as an integral part of the signage for the property and be coordinated with other sign elements in terms of type face color and spacing awnings should not be used as advertising features or light sources internally lit awnings are discouraged awnings can be used effectively to add scale visual interestand provide shade to the building facade 171 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture roofline objectives rooflines should be designed to provide diversity in the form of the building and add visual interest to the streetscape rooflines can be used to reduce the mass of large buildings emphasize entrances and provide shelter and shade for the pedestrian design standards pitched roofs buildings with pitched roofs are strongly encouraged where pitched roofs are used the minimal pitch should be at least 5unless this is not feasible from an engineering or technical standpoint buildings with projecting rooflines should be designed to create strong patterns of shade and shadow roof forms roofs should have traditional roof designs such as gambrel gable hipped and saltbox nontraditional roof forms  such as false mansard aframes and shed roofs  should not be used as the primary roofline the use of false mansard roofs or vertical panels are inappropriate forrooflines the cupola projecting from this pitched roof is an example of traditional forms used in a contemporary structure roof colors where the roof will be visible the roofing materials should be selected to complement the color and texture of the buildings facade roof colors should be dark muted earth tones or a color that is darker than the facade stripes patterns or advertising features on the roof are strongly discouraged roofmounted equipment mechanical and other equipment mounted on rooftops must be screened from public view or grouped at the rear of the structure where visibility is limited rooftop screening should be designed as an integral part of the architecture to complement the buildings mass and appearance these design standards are sensitive to the placement of communication reception equipment such as satellite dishes and other external components shedding snow and ice all roofs should be designed to shed snow ice and rainwater in a manner that does not cause a safety hazard or interfere with pedestrians or vehicles flat roofs flat roofs on singlestory isolated buildings are discouraged in most applications flat roofs may be allowed provided that the design creates no horizontal line greater than 50 feet where para pets are used to break up a flat roofline the height of the parapet should be at least five percent of the total length of the wall preferred materials for visible roofs composite asphalt shingles and standingseam nonglare metal are acceptable for visible roofing high gloss roofing materials should not be used roofmounted mechanical equipment has been effectively screened by balustrades 172 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture d i the roofmounted mechanical equipment as well as the dumpsters and downspouts present an unsightly facade in a highly visible location a flat roofed building that is designed as a large billboard with no variations in form to add human scale roofline an unusual roofline derived from the shingle style makes a distinctive profile while maintaining a new england aesthetic the scale of this commercial building has been effectively reduced in its roofline and projecting gables the scale of this large retail building has been reduced in its roof line and roof materials 173 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture t s r en o v a t io n s an objectives some structures in turner were built a number of years ago and may be coming before the planning board for site plan approval as they undergo renovations or additions this can be an opportunity to add visual interest to a building and to strengthen its relationship with the site and nearby structures in many instances existing buildings can be greatly improved by welldesigned additions or remodeling efforts the town expects high quality architectural and site design for all renovated structures design standards alterations where the existing building currently meets the design standards renovations should be designed to respect the proportions fenestration patterns and details of the original building where the existing building does not meet the design standards the owner is strongly encouraged to upgrade the entire structure design applications to the planning board that involve renovations should show all improvements as well as the existing structure a narrative should accompany the application which explains the designers intent to relate the old to new renovations and additions the addition to this restaurant does not relate to the formor building materials of the existing structure materials where a building meets the design guidelines additions or renovations should complement or match the materials of the original structure in color detailing and texture where the building does not meet the standards the owner should demonstrate how the materials used in the renovation will complement the existing structure architectural features renovations should retain any distinctive architectural features or examples of skilled craftsmanship where such features occur similar details should be incorporated into the addition where possible a former school house was transformed into bank with drive up window adding interest and variety to the streetscape turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture 173 174 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture national franchises objectives national franchises eg restaurants service stations retail stores are permitted in commercial and village districts without proper attention to architectural characteristics the design of buildings for these uses can contribute to the loss of community identity by repeating generic architectural forms found throughout the country design standards franchise styles architectural forms primarily derived from building styles from other regions of the country are strongly discouraged new england village prototypes from national franchises are desirable provided they meet the design standards for architectural principles scale color rooflines andmaterials buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not suitable coordination of site features as part of the site plan application provide illustrations including perspective views of all sides of the proposed buildings include all site features and accessory structures eg dumpster screens storage buildings refrigeration lockers playgrounds vending machines signage and lighting in the illustrations to demonstrate how they are being coordinated with the principle building the addition of an outdoor playground bears no relationship to the existing structure approach the result is a box with applied facade features that has no reference to new england design and would not meetthese design standards a restaurant that wasdesigned to complement the vision for a rural highway corridor a national franchise that has been designed with a kit of parts 175 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture national franchises unacceptable franchise designs examples of building forms commonly used by national franchises that would not meet the design standards and would not be desirable acceptable franchise designs examples of architecture for similar uses which respond to new england traditions meeting the design standards 176 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture objectives due to their visibility and mass the design of new or renovated large structures 20000 square feet or greater such as big box retail or grocery stores have the ability to greatly enhance or detract the visual character of the commercial and village districts these structures should be designed as attractive pieces of commercial architecture responsive to their site and respectful of adjacent neighbors design standards design and massing large structures should be designed to break up their mass into smaller visual components use of projections recesses and varied facade treatment the resultant design should provide variation to create a logical building hierarchy and to add shadow depth and scale site design scale reductions of large buildings should be reinforced by site features such as pedestrian pathways landscaping site furnishings and clearly defined entrances avoid major grade changes and retaining walls in site development architectural details architectural details should be used to reduce the scale and uniformity of large buildings elements such as colonnades pilasters gable ends canopies display windows and light fixtures can be effective measures to add visual interest and scale providing they are proportional to the size of the building entrances large structures should have clearly defined and highly visible customer entrances incorporating at least three of the following largescale  significant variations in roof lines  distinctive lighting and landscaping  canopies or porticos  overhangs recesses or projections  pedestrian arcades  raised corniced parapets over the door  peaked roof forms in scale with building  outdoor patios  display windows  architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design where additional stores will be located in the principal building and customer entrances to such stores are outdoors each additional store should incorporate at least two of the aforementioned elements facades and exterior walls horizontal facades greater than 50 feet in length should incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the facade no uninterrupted facade should exceed 50 horizontal feet other devices to add interest to long walls include strong shadow lines changes in rooflines pilasters and other architectural details patterns in the surface material and wall openings facade elements should be coordinated with the landscape plan to maintain visibility from public areas ground floor facades that are visible from public roads should have display windows entry areas awnings or other such features along a minimum of 40% of their horizontal length two examples of largescale buildings whose mass has been reduced by a rhythmic architectural treatment and subtle changes in geometry contrasting vertical elements draw the eye to the entranceways 177 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture central features and amenities each largeretail establishment should contribute to the establishment or enhancement of the pedestrian environment by providing one or more of the following  patioseating area  pedestrian area with benches  kiosk area  fountain  clock tower  other such deliberately shaped area andor a focal feature or amenity that in the judgement of the planning board adequately enhances the pedestrian environment of the large retail store any such area should have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features should be constructed of materials that will enhance the pedestrian environment and are similar and complimentary to the principal materials of the building and the landscape largescale this smaller retail store attached to a large grocery hasbeen designed as an individual building with a separate entrance and architectural detailing a covered walkway connects all the storefronts additional structures development of smaller commercial buildings on outparcels is encouraged to reduce the scale of large parking areas site planning for renovated and new buildings on large parcels should illustrate how additional structures and pedestrian and vehicular movement could be accommodated on the property cart storage shopping carts must be stored inside the building or in cart corrals out of the way of pedestrian circulation where cart corrals are proposed they should be subject to the design standards for accessory structures large retail buildings can be designed to avoid the appearance of a big box massing anddetailing 178 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture linear commercial objectives linear commercial structures eg strip shopping centers and multitenant offices are appropriate within the commercial and village areas provided that they are designed with facades and rooflines that reduce their scale add architectural interest and provide for comfortable pedestrian movement design standards design buildings with multiple storefronts eg strip shopping centers one story office buildings should be visually unified use of complimentary architectural forms similar materials and colors consistent details and coordinated signage entrances linear commercial buildings should have clearly defined and highly visible customer entrances that are designed as integral architectural elements individual entrances should be emphasized facade offsets variations in the building plane facing the public road should be included to add visual interest such as spaces for common entries outdoor eating  social spaces and similar landscaped spaces offsets should be a minimum of four feet covered walkways where a linear commercial building has two or more entrances it should include a permanently covered walkway arcade or open colonnade along its long facade to provide shelter encourage pedestrian movement and visually unite the structure focal points linear commercial buildings should include a focal point  such as raised entrance way clock tower or other architectural elements  to add visual interest and help reduce the scale of the building roof lines variations in rooflines detailing and building heights should be included to break up the scale of connected linear buildings covered walkways add a shadow line which can reduce thescale of a long building and unify its facade colonnades effectively add visual interest to linear buildings while providing scale and protection from the elements long commercial buildings should have a focal point andor an offset in the roofline to break up their mass covered walkways add a shadow line which can reduce thescale 179 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture a linear building that has been effectively scaled downby variations in the roofline and facade each storefront is treated as a separate entity variety in the use of materials adds visual interest to all facades the colonnaded walkway encourages pedestrian movement and window shopping linear commercial 180 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture service stations and convenience stores objectives service stations car washes convenience stores that sell fuel and other automobileoriented facilities should be designed with facade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest drivethroughs for restaurants banks pharmacies and similar uses should be subordinate to the design of the main building design standards design the architecture of service stations convenience stores and other autooriented commercial buildings should follow the same standards recommended for other buildings all architectural details should be related to an overall design theme windows or other forms of fenestration should be included on the facade facing the street which should be treated as a front facade orientation service stations convenience stores and similar uses should be sited to face the street on corner lots said uses may face both streets pump islands and canopies should be located at the rear or on the side of the building so the primary building is the major feature seen from the road canopies canopies should be visually compatible with the main structure in roof pitch architectural detailing materials and color pitched roofs and fascia trim are preferred for canopies bands of bold colors on the canopy and backlighting inside the canopy are strongly discouraged the gas station canopy has been designed to complement the main building the town strongly encourages the use of attached canopies especially in service stations that are being retrofitted site design the site design must address offsite noise exposure underground drainage systems to keep water off public streets eg in the case of car washes snow storage vehicular and pedestrian circulation room for vehicle stacking and other issues peculiar to these uses large openings openings for car washes or service bays should be integrated into the design of the building and sited so they are not directly visible from public roadways or adjacent residential areas pedestrian circulation the front facade should include a pedestrian entrance from the street vehicular access routes should minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation where walkways must cross driveways motorists should be made aware of pedestrians lighting raised crosswalks changes in paving or other devices this service station canopy is designed to be an extension of the building the columns roofline dormers and signagecontribute to a sense of continuity in thearchitecture the flatroofed canopy bears no design relationship to the welldetailed convenience store in terms of form materials or architectural style the store was designed to fit into the residential surroundings 181 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture drivethroughs objectives drivethroughs for restaurants banks pharmacies and similar uses should be subordinate to the design of the main building design standards drivethroughs driveshouldbe incorporated into the design of the building scale color detailing massing and other architectural treatments location drivethroughs should be located at the side or rear of the building and avoid facing the main street unless there are no alternative for safety or security where they are located at the rear consideration should be given to their visibility to ensure the safety of patrons the design of this drivecontinues the theme of adaptive reuse and traditional materials the driveon this bank repeats the same architectural elements used throughout the building 182 turner maine design standards  commercial retail & service building architecture accessory structures objectives nonhabitable structures  such as freestanding atms garages storage units canopies recycling sheds cart corrals and utility buildings  should be treated as architectural elements and meet the same standards as larger buildings design standards design accessory structures should be designed as a coordinated element of the site plan by complementing or matching the materials form roof pitch detailing and color of the main building site planning the location of all accessory structures should be illustrated on the site plan to show how they will be coordinated with plans for circulation landscaping lighting parking and other site features the design of this successful drivethe same roof pitch forms and materials found in the main bank building this atm machine does not relate in form color or materials of the adjacent building by using the same form and materials the canopy over the drive visually compatible with the main bank building this cart corral does not reflect the architecture of the large retail building and appears out of place in the parking lot the design of this successful
