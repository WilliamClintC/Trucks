attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the village council finds a sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of these establishments further there are presently insufficient mechanisms in the village to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises b certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments c unlawful sexual acts occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows d offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions e persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs f numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydia myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid g sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities h numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films i the findings noted in subsections a of this section raise substantial governmental concerns j sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns k a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein l removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters m requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments n the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases o it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity p the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  3113 definitions for

60% or greater however a commercial development of five 5 acres or less and a residential development of ten 10 acres or less must have an adequate drainage outlet as approved by the village engineer if the outlet in those cases is not adequate then detention as determined by the village engineer shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the outlet capacity b dams constructed

storage pool following periods of runoff according to the capacity of the downstream channel to safely carry the flow such release rate shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state c in this regard the village will accept a release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of 3year frequency with a run off rate coefficient of 015 unless the applicant can show by his detailed calculations which are acceptable to the village that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater d the live detention storage to be provided will be calculated on the basis of the 100year frequency rainfall as published by the us weather bureau for this area the detention volume required will be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100year rainfall for any and all durations from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate e a floodwater detention basin which will normally be dry should not hold more than four feet 4 of water and is to be drained in a maximum of seventy two 72 hours following the 100year rainfall  sterling

the facility at the owners expense i floor elevations of neighboring structures shall be at least one and onehalf feet 112 above the high water level of a neighboring detention basin j one method of calculation which will be acceptable to the village for the determination of the capacity of floodwater detention reservoirs in accordance with the requirements of this article is as follows live detention storage  volume runoff 100year  release rate x duration inches   v100  qrtd   ci100td 015 i3td maximum storage volume calculated by this equation for any and all durations td will be the required storage the terms of the above equation are defined as follows qr   the maximum release rate in inches per hour from the land in its natural undeveloped state 015   the coefficient of runoff for the undeveloped land i3   the intensity in inches per hour of the rainfall from the us weather bureau curve for 3year frequency for the time of concentration of the undeveloped land i100   the intensity in inches per hour of rainfall from the us weather bureau curve for 100year frequency for any and all durations td   the duration of the 100year storm which must be varied to determine the most critical and therefore maximum required detention c   the coefficient of runoff for the completely developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir note i100 varies with td however i3 is calculated using the longest time of concentration for the undeveloped land and becomes a constant in the above equation the live detention storage in inches of depth can be converted to acre feet by multiplying the inches of depth by the drainage area in acres and by the factor   102a8 erosion and sedimentation control accompanying the preliminary plat shall also be the site grading plan
