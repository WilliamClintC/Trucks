findings of fact purpose and methods a statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in flood control insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects     68500 3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent the placement of brush rubbish and debris inside the floodplain boundary  6 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application alluvial fan flooding flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is

will be required to submit a new request for extension if desired trap sizing criteria a all fixtures with a potential to carry greasebearing waste shall be plumbed to the grease trap the first step in determining the appropriate size of the grease trap is to calculate the total number of fixture units connected to the trap the following fixture unit counts shall be assigned to each different kind of fixture kind of fixture trap and trap arm size fixture units 3compartment sink 112 2 3 4 2compartment sink 112 2 dishwasher 2 4    337500 garbage grinder 2 4 wok stove 2 4 hand sink  0 mop sink  0 floor drains 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 floor sinks 3 4 3 4 3 4 notes hand sinks and mop sinks are not required to be plumbed to the grease trap for indirect waste systems where hub drains and floor sinks are used as receptors for dishwashers 2 and 3compartment sinks etc the fixture unit shall be twice 2x the floor sink or hub drain fixture unit count in such cases the fixture count for the indirect waste source is not counted b the next step is to determine the minimum flow rating of the grease trap this is done by multiplying the total fixture unit count times three gallonsminute grease trap flow rating   total fixture unit count x 3 gallonsminute c the minimum liquid holding capacity of the trap is calculated by multiplying the grease trap flow rating in gallons per minutes times twelve minutes grease trap liquid holding capacity gallons   grease trap flow rating x 12 minutes d facilities using dishwashers wok stoves or garbage grinders are required to install 2compartment traps with a 12minute total retention time e upon approval from the city manager fixtures receiving nongreasebearing wastes may be drained grease trap but shall not be included for grease trap sizing ie condensate for coolers trap design criteria a the approved design for grease traps shall be as follows 1 the grease trap must be constructed in accordance with the current plumbing codes adopted by the city as amended and installed in a manner acceptable to the city manager no exceptions 2 the grease trap shall have two compartments 3 while operating at the traps rated flow capacity the first compartment must provide a retention time of no less than seven minutes and the second compartment must provide a retention time of no less than five minutes for a minimum total of twelve minutes 4 trap inverts and vents shall be external to the compartments 5 the flow line to the trap upstream of inlet invert must be at least 3 inches above the static water level of the tank 6 similarly the trap vent must be at least 3 inches above the static water level of the tank    338500 7 the trap inlet must be at least 24 inches below the static water level of the tank and the trap outlet must be at least 12 inches above the floor of the tank 8 adequate flow diffusion features must be provided to evenly distribute flow throughout the grease trap examples of such features would include a flow diverter plate in the primary compartment and tee piping on the tank outlet 9 each trap compartment shall be accessible for cleaning and inspection purposes no exceptions b exceptions to certain of these criteria may be considered for approval in conjunction with the plan review process in such cases engineering drawings and supporting performance data must be submitted to and approved by the city manager or his designee prior to grease trap installation metal grease traps of alternative designs may be approved for those sites needing grease traps of 250 gallons or less c view a conceptual drawing of a typical grease trap design d view contact information for grease trap manufacturers that are familiar with these criteria however do not purchase any grease trap without first verifying with the city office that the specific model will be approved for installation secs  reserved division 3 surcharges program a often the wastewater discharged from businesses contains solids and organic matter at higher concentrations in comparison to concentrations found in residential wastewater wastewater is considered to be normal strength if it meets the wastewater quality standards established for typical residential wastewater see normal values in the table below wastewater that exceeds these standards is considered to be extra strength much of the cost associated with treating wastewater is related to the amount of solids that must be removed and the amount of oxygen that is required to stabilize and digest that organic matter in the wastewater as such the treatment of wastewater from some businesses is significantly more expensive than the treatment of typical residential wastewater b relying on the periodic collection and analyses of wastewater samples from each permitted source of industrial waste the surcharge program enables the city to recover the extra costs associated with the treatment of extra strength wastewater designated individualized surcharges are determined for each industrial source these surcharges are based on sitespecific sample results for biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss c normal values 1 bod less than 250 mgl  2 tss less than 250 mgl  3 o&g less than 50 mgl  4 cod less than 560 mgl  and 5 ph 55 to 100 mgl d all users subject to a surcharge are notified by letter and the monthly surcharge fees are applied to the users monthly utility bill of surcharge a for industrial wastes having a cod concentration of 225 or more times that of the bod concentration the surcharge will be based on formula 2 below computations of surcharges shall be based on the following formulas    339500 formula 1 s   bod  250 + tss  250 + 4 x o&g  200 x  formula 2 s   044 x cod  250 + tss  250 + 4 x o&g  200 x  where s   surcharge factor applied to wastewater charge b the surcharge is computed by multiplying the monthly wastewater charge for the facility by s c bod tss o&g and cod refer to the annual average concentrations of those parameters measured in mgl as reported by the permit holder or as measured by the city manager if the concentration of any of these pollutants is less than the concentration of normal wastewater then the term in the equation for that parameter will be deleted d 1 all flow rates bod cod o&g and tss values used in determination of the surcharge of major wastewater customers shall be reevaluated on an annual basis and shall be adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in wastewater treatment costs based on the previous years experience however if there is a major change in the operation to cause changes in value the values may be increased or decreased during the calendar year based on a study of changes or actual measurements 2 the permit holder may request an adjustment of surcharge after submittal of any selfmonitoring report sec 2 adopted  article 1306 public rightsofway management policy
