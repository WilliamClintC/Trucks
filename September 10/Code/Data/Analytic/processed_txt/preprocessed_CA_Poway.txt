variance procedures nature of variances  appeal board  conditions for variances  nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this division would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this division are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2004  appeal board in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this division and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges  2004        conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of chapters 1686 and 1688 pmc have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in pmc upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san diego county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency g variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in pmc to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in pmc  see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in pmc of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances h variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a e of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance i upon consideration of the factors of pmc a and the purposes of this division the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division  2004     letter of map amendment repealed by  provisions title  statutory authority  purpose  applicability of

maintenance of stormwater facilities  2010   2002  general categories of water pollution urban runoff from a developed site has the potential to contribute pollutants including oil and grease suspended solids metals gasoline pesticides and pathogens to the stormwater conveyance system and receiving waters for the purposes of identifying pollutants of concern and associated stormwater bmps pollutants are grouped in nine general categories as follows a sediments sediments are soils or other surficial materials eroded and then transported or deposited by the action of wind water ice or gravity sediments can increase turbidity clog fish gills reduce spawning habitat lower young aquatic organisms survival rates smother bottom dwelling organisms and suppress aquatic vegetation growth b nutrients nutrients are inorganic substances such as nitrogen and phosphorus they commonly exist in the form of mineral salts that are either dissolved or suspended in water primary sources of nutrients in urban runoff are fertilizers and eroded soils excessive discharge of nutrients to water bodies and streams can cause excessive aquatic algae and plant growth such excessive production referred to as cultural eutrophication may lead to excessive decay of organic matter in the water body loss of oxygen in the water release of toxins in sediment and the eventual death of aquatic organisms c metals metals are raw material components in nonmetal products such as fuels adhesives paints and other coatings the primary sources of metal pollution in stormwater are typically commercially available metals and metal products metals of concern include cadmium chromium copper lead mercury and zinc lead and chromium have been used as corrosion inhibitors in primer coatings and cooling tower systems at low concentrations naturally occurring in soil metals are not toxic however at higher concentrations certain metals can be toxic to aquatic life humans can be impacted from contaminated groundwater resources and bioaccumulation of metals in fish and shellfish environmental concerns regarding the potential for release of metals to the environment have already led to restricted metal usage in certain applications d organic compounds organic compounds are carbonbased commercially available or naturally occurring organic compounds are found in pesticides solvents and hydrocarbons organic compounds can at certain concentrations indirectly or directly constitute a hazard to life or health when rinsing off objects toxic levels of solvents and cleaning compounds can be discharged to storm drains dirt grease and grime retained in the cleaning fluid or rinse water may also adsorb levels of organic compounds that are harmful or hazardous to aquatic life e trash and debris trash such as paper plastic polystyrene packing foam and aluminum materials and biodegradable organic matter such as leaves grass cuttings and food waste are general waste products on the landscape the presence of trash and debris may have a significant impact on the recreational value of a water body and aquatic habitat excess organic matter can create a high biochemical oxygen demand in a stream and thereby lower its water quality also in areas where stagnant water exists the presence of excess organic matter can promote septic conditions resulting in the growth of undesirable organisms and the release of odorous and hazardous compounds such as hydrogen sulfides f oxygendemanding substances this category includes biodegradable organic material as well as chemicals that react with dissolved oxygen in water to form other compounds proteins carbohydrates and fats are examples of biodegradable organic compounds compounds such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are examples of oxygendemanding compounds the oxygen demand of a substance can lead to depletion of dissolved oxygen in a water body and possibly the development of septic conditions g oil and grease oil and grease are characterized as highmolecularweight organic compounds primary sources of oil and grease are petroleum hydrocarbon products motor products from leaking vehicles esters oils fats waxes and highmolecularweight fatty acids introduction of these pollutants to the water bodies is very possible due to the wide uses and applications of some of these products in municipal residential commercial industrial and construction areas elevated oil and grease content can decrease the aesthetic value of the water body as well as the water quality h bacteria and viruses bacteria and viruses are ubiquitous microorganisms that thrive under certain environmental conditions their proliferation is typically caused by the transport of animal or human fecal wastes from the watershed water containing excessive bacteria and viruses can alter the aquatic habitat and create a harmful environment for humans and aquatic life also the decomposition of excess organic waste causes increased growth of undesirable organisms in the water i pesticides pesticides including herbicides are chemical compounds commonly used to control nuisance growth or prevalence of organisms excessive application of a pesticide may result in runoff containing toxic levels of its active component   42 2008   2002  identifying pollutants from the project area using table 1 pollutants shall be

impaired with the pollutants anticipated to be generated by the project as identified in table 1 any pollutants identified by table 1 which are also causing impairment of receiving waters shall be considered primary pollutants of concern c for projects where no primary pollutants of concern exist those pollutants identified use of table 1 shall be considered secondary pollutants of concern  2008   2002  identifying conditions of concern in receiving waters a common impacts to the hydrologic regime resulting from development typically include increased runoff volume and velocity  reduced infiltration  increased flow frequency duration and peaks  faster time to reach peak flow  and water quality degradation these changes have the potential to permanently impact downstream channels and habitat integrity a change to a priority project sites hydrologic regime would be considered a condition of concern if the change would impact downstream channels and habitat integrity because of these potential impacts the following steps shall be followed by each priority project 1 evaluate the projects conditions of concern in a drainage study report prepared by a registered civil engineer in the state of california with experience in fluvial geomorphology and water resources management the report shall consider the project areas location from the larger watershed perspective topography soil and vegetation conditions percent impervious area natural and infrastructure drainage features and any other relevant hydrologic and environmental factors to be protected specific to the project

preproject hydrologic conditions affecting downstream conditions of concern would be maintained by the proposed project satisfactory to the director of development services by incorporating the site design source control and treatment control requirements identified in this division b priority development projects are subject to the citys hydromodification management plan hmp as incorporated in the poway local susmp the hmp shall demonstrate how priority projects will manage increases in runoff discharge rates and durations where such increased rates and durations are likely to cause increased erosion of channel beds and banks sediment pollutant generation or other impacts to beneficial uses and stream habitat due to increased erosive force projects will be required to utilize a continuous hydrological simulation and the results of a hydromodification management analysis must adhere to the following criteria 1 for flow rates between the preproject lower flow threshold and the preproject 10year runoff event the postproject discharge rates and durations may not deviate above the preproject discharge rates and durations by more than 10 percent over more than 10 percent of the length of the flow duration curve 2 lower flow thresholds may be determined using the tools provided in the local susmp along with a critical flow calculator and channel screening tools developed by the southern california coastal water research project sccwrp these methods identify lower flow thresholds for a range of channel conditions the critical flow calculator recommends a lower flow value of 01q2 03q2 or 05q2 dependent on the receiving channel material and dimensions where q2 is defined as the twoyear runoff event this value will be compared to channel susceptibility rating high medium or low as determined from the most recent sccwrp screening tools to determine the final lower flow threshold 3 the lower flow threshold may alternately be determined as 10 percent of the preproject twoyear runoff event or 01q2 this approach is available if the project applicant chooses not to complete the channel screening analysis c priority development projects are required to implement hydromodification mitigation measures so that postproject runoff flow rates and durations do not exceed preproject flow rates and durations hydromodification mitigation can be provided as follows 1 demonstrate no postproject increase in impervious area and resultant peak flow rates as compared to preproject conditions 2 installation of lid bmps such as bioretention facilities to control runoff flows and durations from new impervious areas 3 mitigation of flow and durations of extended detention flow duration control basins 4 preparation of continuous simulation hydrologic models and comparison of the preproject and mitigated postproject runoff peaks and durations with hydromodification flow controls until compliance is achieved 5 implementation of instream rehabilitation controls to demonstrate that projected increases in runoff peaks andor durations would not accelerate erosion to the rehabilitated receiving stream reach d priority development projects shall be exempt from the hmp criteria under the following conditions 1 if the proposed project does not increase the impervious area or peak flows to any discharge location 2 if the proposed project discharges runoff directly to an exempt receiving water such as the pacific ocean an exempt river reach an exempt reservoir or a tidally influenced area 3 if the proposed project discharges to a stabilized conveyance system that extends to the pacific ocean a tidally influenced area an exempt river reach or reservoir 4 if the contributing watershed area to which the project discharges has an impervious area percentage greater than 70 percent 5 if an urban infill project discharges to an existing hardened or rehabilitated conveyance system that extends beyond the domain of analysis the potential for cumulative impacts in the watershed is low and the ultimate receiving channel has a low susceptibility to erosion as defined in the sccwrp channel assessment tool e lid facilities must be designed to

adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 that it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 that of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use b consistent with the legislative findings the purpose of this chapter is to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and extend beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  and 5 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies c landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershedbased approach can improve californias and poways environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this chapter conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and aesthetic benefits  2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleumbased fertilizers and pesticides and planting climateappropriate shade trees in urban areas  3 conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climateappropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment  4 protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced materials and using
