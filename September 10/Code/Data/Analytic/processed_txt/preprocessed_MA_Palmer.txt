adequate parking while maintaining the character of singledwelling neighborhoods and reducing the amount of impervious surface on a site more parking is required when a vacant lot is being developed because generally the site can more easily be designed to accommodate two parking spaces while minimizing impervious surface in the village center districts where an accessory dwelling unit is being added to a site with an existing dwelling unit it may be permissible to not require additional impervious surface if adequate onstreet parking is available such as in a municipal lot 2 the following

that were operating before the date of adoption of this which did not receive a permit may continue to operate as an approved use if the operator can show proof that the operation was established prior to that date the requirements for verification are listed below a the facility was operating with a town business license from the town of palmer town clerks office b the facility paid taxes as required by the state or federal government for this facility c other official documentation can be provided to the planning board office sufficient to verify the operation of this facility 2 alterations and expansions the approved conditional use status provided for in above applies only to the number of bedrooms and size of facility that existed on the date of adoption of this expansions of building area or alterations that increase the intensity of the facility are not allowed unless approved site plan approval as provided in  drivethrough facilities a purpose the regulations of this section are intended to allow for driveby reducing the negative impacts they may create of special concern are noise from idling cars and voice amplification equipment lighting air pollution and queued traffic interfering with onsite and offsite traffic and pedestrian flow the specific purposes of this chapter are to 1 reduce noise lighting air pollution and visual impacts on abutting uses particularly residential uses 2 promote safer and more efficient onsite vehicular and pedestrian circulation 3 reduce conflicts between queued vehicles and traffic on adjacent streets b when these regulations apply 1 uses the regulations of this chapter apply to all uses that have drivea site development the regulations of this chapter apply only to the portions of the site development that comprise the drivethe regulations apply to new developments the addition of driveto existing developments and the relocation of an existing drivedriveare not a right  the size of the site or the size and location of existing structures and abutting structures may make it impossible to meet the regulations of this section in addition drive must comply with all other requirements of the base zone andor overlay zone that the property is located in b parts of a drivea driveis composed of two parts  the stacking lanes and the service area the stacking lanes are the space occupied by vehicles queuing for the service to be provided the service area is where the service occurs in uses with service windows the service area starts at the service window in uses where the service occurs indoors the service area is the area within the building where the service occurs for other development such as gas pumps air compressors vacuum cleaning stations the service area is the area where the vehicles are parked during the service c setbacks and landscaping 1 all drivemust provide the setbacks and landscaping stated below a abutting an r zone service areas and stacking lanes must be set back thirty 30 feet from all lot lines which abut r zones the setback must be landscaped to at least the standard as stated in landscaping screening and buffers b abutting a b i or vc zone service

lanes must be clearly identified use of means such as striping landscaping and signs 17192 self service storage a purpose selfservice storage uses have some characteristics in common with both commercial use and industrial uses this chapter provides regulations so that selfservice storage uses can be appropriately sited in either industrial zones or some commercial zones while maintaining the desired character and function of the specific zones in general selfservice storage uses are similar to other commercial uses in that they provide a service to residential and business uses the character of their development is often more similar to industrial buildings and their low activity level does not add to the vitality of a commercial area b use regulations other uses on the site such as the rental of trucks or moving equipment must meet the use and development standards of the base zone or overlay zone c development standards 1 the development standards of the base zone apply unless the standard is superceded by regulations in this section a purpose the special development standards in the hb and ind zones are intended to allow selfservice storage facilities to locate on certain sites in these zones where they can be close to the residential and business uses that they serve at the same time the development standards direct their location to sites that do not have major frontage on commercial streets this prevents large sections of the commercial streets from being developed with uses that have extremely low activity levels which detract from the vitality and desired interaction among commercial uses in the area this also allows them to locate on oddshaped or infill sites that are difficult to develop for many commercial uses b storage areas the maximum size of individual storage areas each individual storage unit within the building in hb and ind zones is five hundred 500 square feet amended atm   c internal circulation the internal circulation between buildings must be adequate to provide access for emergency vehicles amended atm     d parking for parking requirements see parking and loading e outside storage outside storage shall be prohibited any large exterior parking stalls for boats campers etc shall be to the rear of the property and adequately screened so as not to be visible from the street or abutting properties d selfservice storage design guidelines 1 purpose design review is required for new buildings in the hb and ind zones to ensure that the development has a high design quality appropriate to the designed character of the zone and to avoid the monotonous look of many industrialstyle buildings these design guidelines are used to review new selfservice storage uses in the hb and ind zones in addition to all other required plans an elevation and faade plan must be submitted at the time of application for a special permitsite plan approval a building and roof design the building and roof are designed to be compatible with surrounding development especially nearby residential uses considerations include design elements that break up long monotonous building or rooflines and elements that are compatible with the desired character of the zone b building materials the materials used for buildings roofs fences and other structures are compatible with the desired character of the zone and are visually pleasing especially near residential uses c street facades the design and layout of the street side of the site provides a varied and interesting facade considerations include the use of setbacks building placement roof design variations in building walls fencing other structural elements and landscaping d landscaping the landscaping on the site provides appropriate transition from public to private spaces separates and buffers the buildings from other uses especially abutting residential uses and provides visual relief from stark linear building walls e fencing any proposed fencing is designed to be compatible with the desired character of the area and is especially sensitive to abutting residential uses use of rolled razor wire or barbed wire is discouraged f security the perimeter of the site is designed to provide adequate security for both the site and abutting sites considerations include fence and wall materials and placement type and placement of landscaping including thorny plant materials and desired visibility or privacy landscaping screening and buffers 17193 landscaping screening and buffers a purpose 1 the town recognizes the aesthetic ecological and economic value of landscaping and requires its use to a promote the reestablishment of vegetation in areas for aesthetic health and wildlife reasons b establish and enhance a pleasant visual character which recognizes aesthetics and safety issues c promote compatibility between land uses by reducing the visual noise and lighting impacts of specific development on users of the site and abutting uses d unify development and enhance and define public and private spaces e promote the retention and use of existing vegetation f aid in energy conservation by providing shade from the sun and shelter from the wind g restore natural communities establishment of native plants h mitigate for loss of natural resource values 2 this chapter consists of a set of landscaping screening and

circumstances the members of the planning board may invoke the rule of necessity to allow disqualified members to act the rule of necessity provides that a board may invoke this rule for a members who would be disqualified from participation on a specific town board action eg because of a conflict of interest to participate because of lack of a quorum needed to take action the rule of necessity is not a law written and passed by the legislature rather the rule of necessity was developed because judges applied it in their court decisions the rule of necessity works in the following way 1 it can only be used if a board is unable to act on a matter because it lacks the number of members required to take a valid official vote solely because members are disqualified from acting 2 the rule of necessity should be invoked by one or more of the otherwise disqualified members upon advice from town or city counsel or the state ethics commission 13 3 if it is proper for the rule of necessity to be used it should be clearly indicated in the minutes of the meeting that the board was unable to obtain a quorum due to disqualification of members and as a last resort that all those disqualified may now participate under the authority of the rule of necessity each disqualified member who wishes to participate under the rule of necessity must first disclose publicly the facts that created the conflict it should be noted however that invoking the rule of necessity does not require all previously disqualified members to participate  it merely permits their participation the rule of necessity may only be used as a last resort 4 every effort must be made to find another board capable under the law of acting in place of the board that could not obtain a quorum state ethics commission fact

or does not possess the minimum required qualifications any applicant aggrieved by a selection of an outside consultant may appeal to the town manager provided that such appeal is entered within seven days after such selection has been made as recorded in the office of the town clerk an appeal will not be consigned valid unless it is formally filed with the office of the town clerk and a copy is given to the town manager the applicant should notify the board of its intentions to seek a waiver at the earliest possible time in the review and consultant selection process if the applicant fails to sign andor file a formal waiver of appeal this action will then be viewed as an intention to appeal on part of the project applicants failure to inform the board of such intention of appeal may result in the delay of the startup of the town outside review services in acting on an administrative appeal the town manager may determine that a a conflict of interest does exist andor the consultant does not meet the minimum qualifications therefore the board must select another consultant b a conflict of interest does not exist andor the consultant does meet the minimum qualifications
