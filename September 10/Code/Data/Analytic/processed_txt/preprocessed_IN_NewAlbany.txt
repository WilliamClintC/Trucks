construction requires closer spacing as well as larger water mains size of undivided areas exposure and protection by sprinklers is to be considered a hydrant within 300 feet is recommended for each 500 gpm fire flow actual fire flows are calculated from test results to a 20 psi residual pressure ca minimum of 1000 gpm @ 20 psi residual is required for a typical small modern noncombustible elementary school 1500 gpm to 2000 gpm for a larger school dfor a typical eightunit twostory frame brick veneer apartment building 1500 gpm would be minimum if larger than 10000 square feet floor area or less than 50 feet clear space between buildings larger flows would be needed in a nine to 20 unit typical frame brick veneer unit 2000 gpm over 20 units in excess of 2500 gpm ea small commercial or industrial building with average type fire loading basically unexposed by other properties requires a minimum of 1500 gpm area is a major factor with these type properties and this requirement

the foreseeable future the zoning recognize the particular needs of agriculture and the characteristics of agricultural land just as it recognizes urban forms of land use the following goals are set aprovide for the retention of prime agricultural lands that are not essential to meet the needs of urban growth during the planning period  bprotect those agricultural areas from the intrusion of small lot residential development and from other nonfarm related uses and activities  and cprovide those community services needed by rural residents passed 7121971   residential goals recognizing that residential development constitutes the largest single use of improved land special attention in planning must be accorded to the quality of housing and residential areas the following goals are established athe shaping of existing residential development into functional neighborhood units  bthe encouragement of new and creative forms of housing and neighborhood designs  cthe development of residential areas into functional units of a size that will enhance their physical and social identity and which may be efficiently served by a full complement of services and facilities required by the residents  and dadequate open space should be provided within and between planned residential areas passed 7121971   commercial goals commercial activities are important both for the services they provide and their economic base in providing tax income and employment the following are fixed awhere possible consolidate existing commercial areas into more functional units  ballocate a sufficient amount of land appropriately located to provide for a variety of commercial developments and activities necessary to serve and support the projected population  cstrive for the elimination of inappropriate strip zoning which fosters conflict between street use and movement  and dwhere appropriate apply the use of natural or humanmade barriers as buffers or demarcation lines between commercial and residential land use areas better still initiate new techniques for blending these seemingly incompatible uses passed 7121971   industrial goals industry has long supported a substantial part of this areas economy however its characteristics and needs are changing and the comprehensive plans recommendations must accommodate these emerging needs if industrial opportunities are to be maximized the following goals have been determined ameet the potential for desirable industrial development provision of sufficient industrial land for a variety of locations furnished with

encouraged passed 7121971 policies   general policies concerning land uses athe use of land to meet the needs of urban growth should be confined to the areas delineated in the land use plan for those purposes assuming transportation and community facilities can be provided planning period new development should adjoin presently developed areas to prevent the costly and undesirable consequences of scattered development blands to be developed for urban uses are dependent upon a broad range of urban services and improvements for example streets utilities schools parks health facilities libraries police and fire protection and satisfactory arrangements for the provision of these needed facilities shall go hand in hand with plans for the development of new lands clands in natural drainage courses flood plains marshes and steep hillsides unsuitable because of topographic or geologic characteristics should remain undeveloped dlands not well suited to development because of natural characteristics should be permanently reserved as open space by public agencies  ownership in fee  zoning  or by establishing scenic easements or use regulation in addition to retaining the lands to satisfy natural functions open space can serve as a determinant of urban form  can be utilized for casual recreation and the study of nature and can make a valuable contribution to the quality of urban life ethe intrusion of plat or selloff development into the agricultural areas of the county should be discouraged as being inefficient in terms of supplying needed public services and improvements and as interfering with the socioeconomic structure of the agricultural community recognizing however a valid interest in country living utilizing the nonagricultural land in the rural area as may be appropriate on large parcels of several acres or more fstrip development bordering existing roads whether for residential or commercial use should be discouraged as it increases traffic

from the city out with a clustering of development at outlying centers there are residential sections throughout the city and county which vary in quality  some indicate an instability that leads to eventual blight  some are well planned and stable  and others are poorly planned and already showing characteristics of instability subdivisions are found throughout the county  varying in size quality and relationship to adjacent developments ba primary purpose therefore in guiding land development is the creation of stable residential areas which contain pleasant homes served by a traffic circulation system and which are properly related to commercial areas employment centers and open space in developing an interrelated system of land uses residential areas are generally best formed in elementary school neighborhood units  are bounded by prominent physical land features  and major elements of the circulation system or other more intensive land uses within the residential neighborhood there should be adequate provision for an elementary school church sites local shopping facilities and recreation facilities for both children and adults cresidential areas should be encouraged to develop primarily in the gently rolling areas rather than in the valley bottoms or on the very level lands better suited for agricultural or industrial use dthe development of a variety of housing types and locations should be encouraged by fostering and retaining the natural variety inherent in the landscape by reason of topographic variation views and water area and by allowing for the use of housing types ranging from singlefamily homes to multifamily apartments and providing for variations in the design of these areas and their related facilities passed 7121971   residential

the location of highways an airport water and sewer trunklines can enhance or even create prime sites for industry 4industry has special land and location requirements that cannot be met from land leftover after residential commercial and public uses have been designated the countys land must be evaluated for locations uniquely related to rail  to present and future freeways airports and waterfront location 5potential industrial sites should be kept intact for industrial use when large tracts are broken up by the intrusion of residences or unrelated retail uses the remaining sites are seldom usable for industry 6because the supply of good industrial land is limited and not easily renewable good industrial sites should not be wasted the crowding of new industrial plants today on small inadequate sites will create the slums of tomorrow 7land must be identified now as having potential use for industry within the next two decades the design of highways utilities and other public works near these future sites should proceed on the basis of industrial use in the future 8the location capacity and timing of water sanitary sewer and drainage facilities should be guided by the industrial potential of the land to be served 9with few exceptions industrial management today seeks an attractive location for its new plant laboratory or even warehouse it does not want slum houses shoddy commercial uses or unkempt industries as neighbors 10a planned distribution of industrial sites throughout the county along the radial and circumferential freeways can substantially reduce the time required for the daily journey to work thus extending the hours spent with the family 11the modern factory warehouse or laboratory is a major element of the daily environment of the metropolitan area properly and prominently located its architecture and landscaping can be an aesthetic contribution to the physical design of the community 12industrial areas should be located where they can be adequately served by major utility lines which include electric power stations and transmission lines trunk sewer lines and trunk gas lines 13whereas collector and local arterial streets serving residential areas are designed primarily for passenger automobile service industries should be located with access provided only to expressway or major truck routes so that traffic will not pass areas
