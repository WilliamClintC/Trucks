regulating residency and presence restrictions for sex offenders a findings and intent whereas the village board defines a designated offender to mean a person who has been convicted of or has been found delinquent of or has been found not guilty by reason of disease or mental defect of a sexually violent offense andor a crime against children which includes crimes placing children at risk defined and described within footnote 1  and whereas the village board has recently learned that there currently are 35 individuals who reside in the village who reasonably meet the definition of a designated offender   and whereas the village board has concluded that the number of designated offenders residing within the village unreasonably exceeds the number of designated offender s residing within other communities in waukesha county as demonstrated by the data contained in footnote 2  and whereas the village board has concluded that the wisconsin department of corrections has facilitated the placement of such a high number of designated offenders within the village because of the absence of any village ordinance regulating the residence or presence of designated offender s near identified child safety zones as described in footnote 3 whereas the village board has been informed that the existence of a focused practice involving vigorous community policing whereby the hartland police department has regularly tracked the presence of designated offenders residing in the village and regularly interacted with them to remind them that their presence is known to law enforcement with the goal of deterring recidivism and discouraging the concealment of the residency of designated offenders in the village  and whereas the village board has now concluded that an ordinance regulating the residency and imposing presence restrictions for designated offenders is now warranted  and whereas the village board realizes that the formulation of a reasoned and defensible ordinance in light of current legal challenges to such ordinances will take a reasonable amount of time b incorporation of findings and intent the findings and intent section as well as all

except as otherwise specified in wis stats   wis stats  6135 applies to this article and to any amendments to this article b the provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body c the village of hartland hereby designates the director of public works its village engineer and its building inspector or their respective designees to

performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under  nr  wis adm  1092017 findings of fact the village of hartland finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  1092017 purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this article is to establish longterm post construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property 4 minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state 5 limit nonpoint runoff pollution in order to achieve water quality standards b intent it is the intent of the village of hartland that this article regulate postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this article may be applied on a sitebysite basis the village of hartland recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge from the sites where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats  28116 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the village of hartland it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community  1092017 applicability and jurisdiction a applicability 1 where
