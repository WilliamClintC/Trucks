condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred b if a substantially damaged building is rebuilt in violation of this division including not properly elevated or floodproofed nonresidential buildings only flood insurance will be significantly higher in addition the property owner will not be eligible for an increased cost of compliance claim payment the nfip has implemented a new coverage called increased cost of compliance which is an endorsement to the standard flood insurance policy it applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after  structures that have suffered substantial damage from flooding may be required to elevate demolish relocate or floodproof nonresidential buildings only the damaged structure upon rebuilding through increased cost of compliance coverage funds are available to the property owner to pay for flood protection measures that meet nfip standards c property owners may file for increased cost of compliance coverage in two instances 1 if the city determines that the home or business is damaged by flood two times within a 12year period to the point that repairs will cost 50 percent or more of the buildings predamaged market value this is substantial damage 2 if the city determines that the home or business was damaged by a flood two times within a 12year period where the cost of repairing the flood damage on average equaled or exceeded 25 percent of its market value at the time of each flood event this is repetitive damage additionally there

division 1 generally purpose intent applicability compatibility and administration a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect the public health safety environment and general welfare establishment of a stormwater utility in the city the objectives of this article are as follows 1 the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities as a result the specific service system and facility demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems an advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization therefor a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level 4 it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the citys general tax revenues and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding 5 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare 6 provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities renders or results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems 7 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits 8 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs 9 the mayor and council find conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city b applicability the provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of the city c compatibility with other regulations
