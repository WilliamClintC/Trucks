subdivider is encouraged to use the concept plan review process to test ideas and alternative development plans to test variations in design not specifically provided for by this part or other rules and regulations to identify any potential issues early in the process or to simply gauge public and city acceptance of a proposed subdivision the concept plan is an optional stage of any subdivision process but is recommended in the case of large or complex subdivisions or as a tool in the annexation process the concept plan is also used to review townhome and condominium subdivisions at the time of preliminary plat of the super lot and should be filed concurrently with the preliminary plat applications where the development concept is known 3 preliminary plat the preliminary plat review process provides an opportunity for the subdivider to obtain approval of the lot layout and general design of the subdivision from the planning commission prior to completing detailed engineering the preliminary plat process verifies the conformance of the proposed subdivision with city standards codes rules regulations and ordinances and the citys comprehensive plan the process helps to identify issues that must be addressed to ensure conformance with all municipal requirements prior to final plat and recording identifies needed improvements and facilitates resolution of any complex issues associated with the proposal 4 final plat the final plat review process 1 documents conformance of the proposed subdivision with all city standards codes rules regulations and ordinances  2 ensures the design of proposed infrastructure meets the requirements of the public works and utilities design and construction specifications  3 determines conformance with any applicable preliminary plat

citywide appraisal of developed lands on the county assessors average developed land value in the city or some other acceptable method of determining land values the rate shall be adjusted annually based on changes in land values the cashinlieu schedule may be applied to all lands being subdivided on a per unit or per lot basis if the council does not adopt a schedule of fees based on the dedication rates and an established developed land value when cashinlieu of land area dedication is to occur at the time of submittal of documents for a final plat the subdivider shall submit an appraisal purchase price or other indication of the actual market value of the buildable land area based on the approved preliminary or proposed final plat ie value shall be based on anticipated market value after completion of platting and completion of all required public improvements the actual value of the land shall be determined by mutual agreement between the subdivider and the subdivision administrator in the event that the parties cannot agree on the actual value of the sites an independent qualified appraiser shall be selected by mutual agreement of the disagreeing parties said appraisers findings on the actual value of the total site shall be final and binding on all parties a qualified appraiser shall be a member of the appraiser institute mai or an accredited rural appraiser ara the subdivider shall pay the full cost of said appraiser this method shall establish the base land value for purposes of establishing the cashinlieu due at time of platting where the fees are to be paid at time of building permit the base land value and schedule of fees established at the time of platting shall be inflated annually by the average increase in land values within the city of fountain as determined by a review of the county assessors data developed land value is the value of the land following platting and completion of all public improvements  1625 criteria for traffic impact studies  introduction this appendix outlines the policies and requirements for the preparation of traffic impact studies tis for development proposals in the city of fountain these requirements exist to ensure consistent traffic analysis practices for developments being considered the responsibility for evaluating the traffic impacts associated with a proposed development rests with the applicant the applicant is responsible for retaining a qualified transportation professional to provide an accurate and complete accounting of probable traffic impacts related to the proposed development the city of fountain planning and public works staff are responsible for review of traffic impact studies to ensure that the study is completed accurately and in accordance with these requirements   when a traffic impact study is required unless waived by the city engineer the city requires a tis for any new development proposal that could potentially have a significant impact as determined by the city on the transportation system any of the following may be considered significant impacts  daily trip generation is projected to be 500 or more vehicles  peak hour trip generation is projected to be 50 or more vehicles  traffic from a development will impact adjacent residential neighborhoods  driveway impacts on public streets related to turning movements or signal timingprogression  offsite collector and arterial road links and intersections that are impacted by 10% or more during either am or pm peak hour  significant citizen concern due to expected traffic impacts a tis may also be required when a previously approved development changes or expands in such a way that the approved access to the site is affected or trip generation estimates increase by more than 20% over the original estimates a tis may also be required for each phase of a large phased development in this situation an overall tis would be completed for the overall proposal followed by an addendum prior to the development of each phase   traffic impact study preparation and review process the subdivider is responsible for contacting the planning division before a development application is submitted to determine if a tis will be required the need for a tis will be determined as part of the preapplication conference prior to the commencement of the tis a presubmittal meeting must be held between the city engineer and the transportation professional retained by the subdivider to discuss the scope of the study and the requirements for the study content and format the presubmittal meeting is intended to provide a firm base of cooperation and communication between the city the subdivider and the transportation consultant at a minimum topics discussed at such meetings will include study area proposed land uses trip generation trip distribution traffic projection years intersections requiring analysis signal timing assumptions and background traffic assumptions the subdivider shall submit the traffic impact study at the time that the development application is submitted if the study fails to comply with the technical requirements and the scope of the study outlined in the presubmittal meeting the subdivider will be advised in writing citys normal development review process a study must be submitted and accepted by the city before the planning commission schedules the project for consideration the city engineer will review the draft study within fifteen 15 working days of the date of submittal if study revisions are needed the city engineer will normally review the revised study within ten 10 working days of submittal a longer review period will be necessary if the colorado department of transportation cdot or other agencies are involved in the review process   traffic impact study requirements a study purpose and site description the study shall include a brief description of the development application proposal ie annexation rezoning subdivision site plan application etc it shall also include a brief description of the development proposal including the site location the size of the land parcel general terrain features the types of land uses being proposed and the proposed access points b study area the boundaries of the study area will be based on engineering judgment and an understanding of existing traffic conditions surrounding the site the limits should be agreed upon at the presubmittal meeting with staff the boundaries of the study area shall be based on the size and extent of the proposed development and its relation to significant streets and intersections large developments may require a study area extending beyond one mile due to the magnitude of potential impacts as a minimum the study area will include  adjacent streets  adjacent or nearest offsite arterialarterial or arterialcollector intersections  site access points  internal roads  offsite collector and arterial road links and intersections that are impacted by 5% or more during either am or pm peak hour  continuity and adequacy of pedestrian and bicycle facilities to the nearest attraction existing or planned

of a school a vicinity map that shows the site and the study area boundaries in relation to the surrounding transportation system must be included in the study all arterial and collector streets in the study area and access points to the site should be shown on the map key intersections in the study area that will be analyzed in the study shall be identified at the presubmittal meeting the key intersections should be identified on the map c study horizons three study horizons are required for analysis the current conditions short term and long term the current existing conditions should be analyzed to establish a baseline of traffic conditions the shortterm horizon represents the planned opening year of the project both a background analysis and analysis with the project completed should be completed to assess the shortterm impacts of the project assumptions about street improvements not associated with the study project in the short term should be based on projects shown in the citys capital improvement program or projects that have already been financially obligated to a subdivider the long term planning horizon represents conditions at 80% build out of the fountain planning area as shown in the fountain comprehensive development plan fcdp for land uses in compliance with the fcdp this analysis should be completed using forecast volumes and roadway improvements as shown in the fcdp for land uses that are not in compliance with the fcdp analyses for both the adopted land uses in the fcdp and the proposed land uses should be completed so that the impact of the land use change can be evaluated when an overall traffic impact study is completed for a phased development the study shall look at all three study horizons addenda for each phase of development should only look at the current conditions and the shortterm horizon d analysis time periods normally the analysis time periods will be the weekday am and pm peak hours under some circumstances the city may require analyses to occur at other times as appropriate e existingbase conditions 1 existing and proposed land uses a complete description including a map of the existing land uses in the study area as well as their current zoning shall be included in the study in addition the future uses of all vacant land within the study area that may be developed within the projection year of the project must be identified for the short term horizon only land where development applications have been approved should be considered as developed within the projection year for the longterm horizon land uses shown in the fcdp should be assumed as developed within the projection year 2 existing and proposed transportation system the study shall describe the existing roadways and intersections in the study area including the road geometry and intersection traffic control for the shortterm horizon assumptions about road improvements related to the development shall be based on the citys capital improvement program and on improvements already financially obligated to a subdivider for the longterm horizon all improvements shown in the fcdp within the study area should be assumed 3 existing traffic current am and pm peak hour traffic volumes shall be obtained for the roadways and intersections within the study area current means counts less than a year old a map or series of maps of the existing roadway network shall be prepared showing the existing conditions and volume counts including lane geometry traffic control access points turning movement volumes and calculated peak hour factors 4 background traffic a short term horizon for the short term horizon background traffic shall be the sum of existing traffic volumes plus the addition of traffic from any not yet built but approved developments in the study area plus background traffic growth background traffic growth should be calculated from historical 24hour volume counts in the city of fountain in the vicinity of the proposed development staff will provide this information when it is available the annual percentage of background traffic growth should be agreed upon at the presubmittal meeting b long term horizon for the longterm horizon background traffic shall be based on the most recent traffic forecasts from the citys long range transportation model maps of both the short term and long term roadway network shall be prepared showing the projected conditions and projected volume counts including lane geometry traffic control access points am and pm peak hour turning movement volumes and calculated peak hour factors f site related traffic 1 trip generation a summary table listing each type of land use the size or amount involved the trip generation rates used and the resultant total trips must be provided trip generation rates shall be calculated using data contained in the latest edition of the institute of transportation engineers ite trip generation manual or from a local trip generation study following procedures prescribed in the ite trip generation manual if a local trip generation study is used to determine the trip generation rate documentation of the trip generation study and the resulting rate should be included in an appendix of the traffic impact study the ite trip generation manual presents data on trip generation rates in various formats a weighted average trip generation rate is shown also when possible a regression equation is presented that defines the line representing best fit of the data trip generation rates should be determined as outlined below a use regression equation when  a regression equation is provided  the independent variable is within range of data and  either the data plot has at least 20 points  or  the r2 is greater than or equal to 075 equation falls within the data cluster in the plot and the standard deviation is greater than 110% of the weighted average rate b use the weighted average rate when  at least three data points  independent variable is within range of data  standard deviation is less than or equal to 110% of the weighted average rate  r2 is less than 075 or no equation provided  weighted average rate falls within data cluster plot c collect local data when  study site is not compatible with ite land use code definition  only 1 or 2 data points  preferably when five or fewer data points  independent variable does not fall within range of data  neither weighted average rate line or fitted curve fall within data cluster at size of development trip making reduction factors may be used after first generating trips at full ite rates these factors fall into two categories those that reassign some portion of generated trips to the background stream of traffic and those that remove or move generated trips in all cases the underlying assumptions of the ite trip generation rates must be recognized and considered before any reductions are claimed the first category is when trips to the proposed development currently exist as part of the background traffic stream referred to as passby trips passby percentages identified by ite or in other industry publications may typically be used but the source of the percentages must be identified and the city must approve use passby traffic must continue to be assigned to site driveways and access points but is not additive to the background traffic stream an appendix that illustrates the assignment of passby trips must be included in the report the second category for adjustments is for internal site trips transit use and transportation demand management tdm actions reductions of these types may be allowed if analytic support is provided to show how the figures were derived the city must approve any reductions that are claimed optimistic assumptions regarding transit use and tdm actions will not be accepted unless accompanied by specific implementation proposals that will become a condition of development approval such implementation proposals must have a high expectation of realization within a 3year period after project initiation 2 trip distribution the percentage of trips tofrom the proposed development tofrom destinations in the region must be clearly shown graphically in the report the consultant shall be responsible for estimating trip distribution marketing studies subarea transportation studies documented existing traffic patterns and professional judgment may be used to make trip distribution assumptions whatever methods are used the procedures and rationale used should be fully explained and documented in the study different trip distribution assumptions can be used for different land uses in mixeduse developments if more than one set of distribution assumptions are made they should be shown on separate graphics 3 trip assignment site generated traffic shall be assigned to the street system according to the trip distribution percentages determined in the previous step the traffic assignment must be clearly shown graphically in the report g analysis and identification of impacts 1 tasks the project impacts shall be determined analysis procedure that follows the sequence of tasks outlined below  assessment of existing conditions  assessment of short term background conditions  assessment of short term conditions with the planned land use shown in the fcdp for the land being proposed for development this task is only needed when the proposed development is requesting a land use amendment  assessment of short term conditions with the proposed development  assessment of long term background conditions  assessment of the long term conditions with the proposed development when a land use amendment is being requested 2 highway capacity analysis assessment techniques for existing conditions short term background and short term with the development will include a capacity and level of service los analysis for the key intersections identified in the study area during the identified analysis time periods for signalized intersections the analyses shall be completed using the operational analysis methodology shown in the latest edition of highway capacity manual published by the transportation research board both volume to capacity ratio vc ratio and level of service for each movement shall be reported in a table or diagram for each signalized intersection analyzed the overall intersection level of service shall also be reported the city of fountains benchmark for traffic congestion states that all signalized intersections should be maintained at overall los c or better in addition the benchmark requires that all movements that have 5% or more of the total entering intersection volume should be maintained at los c or better and have a volume to capacity ratio less than 10 therefore any signalized intersections or movements at signalized intersections that exceed these thresholds should be noted the capacity and level of service analysis at signalized intersections shall be performed using the following assumptions  peak hour factors should be calculated on an approach by approach basis from the turning movement count data collected for the analysis  right turns on red should not be considered unless specific data documenting the percentage of turns on red is collected  unless approved by the city at the presubmittal meeting all arrival types shall be assumed to be type 3 as defined in the highway capacity manual  signal controller unit extension should be assumed to be 30 for 0 for left turn movements unless otherwise approved by the city  start up lost time should be assumed to be 20 seconds unless otherwise approved by the city  extension of effective green should be assumed to be 30 seconds unless otherwise approved by the city  traffic signal timing parameters for the existing conditions will be the actual signal timing in effect unless determined otherwise by the city traffic signal timing parameters for the short term background conditions and the short term conditions with the development will use signal cycle lengths between 80 and 120 seconds cycle lengths and individual green intervals will be calculated to provide the least overall intersection delay while maintaining all movements below benchmark thresholds whenever possible clearance intervals shall be the actual times currently in effect for all scenarios analyzed where different signal phasing from the existing is used for the analysis this change shall be noted in the list of traffic impacts where traffic signals are part of a coordinated signal system or where proposed new signals are within a half mile of another signal the cycle lengths used for analysis should be the same at all intersections analyzed  saturation flow rate will be assumed to be 1900 passenger cars per hour of green per lane pcphgpl  lane widths should be assumed to be 12 feet wide unless other data shows otherwise  2% trucks should be assumed for all movements unless approved otherwise by the city  saturation flow adjustment factors should be as per the highway capacity manual  where dual left turns exist or are proposed they shall be assumed to operate in a protected only mode  free running right turns that are not effected by the signal timing should be excluded from the analysis 3 los analysis unsignalized intersections level of service analysis for unsignalized intersections shall be done in accordance with the methodology for unsignalized intersections in the latest edition of the highway capacity manual the results of the unsignalized intersection analysis should be shown in the table or diagram used for signalized intersection results the following assumptions should be used for the analysis of unsignalized intersections  duration of analysis period is assumed to be 25 hour  peak hour factors should be calculated on an approach by approach basis from the turning movement count data collected for the analysis  2% trucks should be assumed for all movements unless approved otherwise by the city  saturation flow rate will be assumed to be 1700 pcphgpl  critical gap and follow up time shall be in accordance with the values given in the highway capacity manual 4 long range assessment assessment techniques for both long term background and long term with the proposed development will require analysis using the planning methodology for signalized intersections and the unsignalized intersection methodology for unsignalized intersections as outlined in the latest edition of the highway capacity manual the condition ie under capacity near capacity over capacity etc for signalized intersections and the level of service for unsignalized intersections should be reported in a table or diagram assumptions for the longrange unsignalized intersection analysis shall be the same as for the shortterm analysis the following assumptions shall be used for the longrange signalized intersection analysis  a peak hour factor of 09 shall be used  cycle lengths between 80 and 120 seconds shall be used 5 access evaluation assessment techniques for existing conditions short term background short term with the development long term background and long term with the development will also include an evaluation of each proposed access point accesses should be considered intersections and included in the level of servicecapacity analysis described above safety is the top priority at access points the city has developed standards for the spacing and design of access points to provide optimum safety accesses should be reviewed to ensure compliance with city and cdot if on a state highway standards proposed access points that do not meet the pertinent standards should be noted in addition all access points should be evaluated to determine what auxiliary lanes are required in accordance with city standards and the state highway access where applicable 6 evaluation of signal progression in coordinated signal systems according to city standards intersections with the potential for signalization should be spaced no closer than one half mile if a development proposes an access or intersection that is projected to be signalized and is less than a half mile from other signals or other planned signals a progression analysis shall be conducted to demonstrate that a new signal can be installed without negatively impacting progression the analysis shall consider all existing signals or possible future signals within one mile in each direction from the proposed signal location on existing coordinated arterials it must be demonstrated that the existing bandwidth in each direction can be maintained with the new signal installed where a new coordinated system will occur as a result of the new signal it must be demonstrated that a bandwidth of at least 45% can be achieved in each direction unless otherwise directed by the city the following assumptions shall be used for the progression analysis  a cycle length between 80 and 120 seconds should be used for analysis  actual prevailing speeds on the arterial shall be used for travel speed in the analysis  split assumptions shall be based on projected turning movement volumes and designed to maintain all movements with at least 5% or more of the total intersection traffic at los c or better and below vc ratio of 10 where pedestrian volumes are expected to be high to be determined in the presubmittal meeting side street splits long enough to accommodate pedestrians shall be used assuming a 40 fps walking speed  where left turn arrows are anticipated protectedpermissive phasing should be assumed unless dual left turns are projected then protected only left turn phasing should be assumed  lagging left turns will not be allowed for protectedpermitted left turn phases  any access where the required bandwidth cannot be achieved should be noted any such access shall remain unsignalized and have turning movements limited by driveway design andor median islands to prevent the need for signalization timespace diagrams shall be included in an appendix to the study 7 other analysis where the city deems it appropriate other types of analysis may be required in the traffic impact study other types of analysis may include but are not limited to sight distance evaluation transit and tdm opportunities pedestrianbicycle needs environmental evaluations and evaluation of neighborhood impacts   impact mitigation measures a summary of analysis a conclusions and recommendations chapter should be included in the traffic impact study the results of the analysis should be summarized in this chapter this summary should note all impacts to the transportation system and recommendations for site access roadway improvements and travel demand strategies needed to maintain traffic flow safely and at a level of service in keeping with the citys congestion benchmark in the event that the analysis indicates unsatisfactory levels of service or vc ratio at any study intersection a description of proposed mitigation techniques or physical improvements to remedy deficiencies must be included it should be noted if the recommended improvements are part of the citys capital improvement program are already financially obligated to another subdivider or if there is currently no funding dedicated for the improvements b transportation demand management if tdm measures are recommended to mitigate unsatisfactory traffic conditions a specific tdm implementation proposal shall be developed and presented to the city if accepted this implementation proposal will become a condition of approval of the land use action requested c evaluation of proposed improvements if unsatisfactory levels of service or vc ratio are predicted by the study and recommendations are made for mitigation additional analysis must be presented which demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation  title 17 zoning article i general provisions introductory provisions of provisions of provisions authority date to the fountain comprehensive development plan
