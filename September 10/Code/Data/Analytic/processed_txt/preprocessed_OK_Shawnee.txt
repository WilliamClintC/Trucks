repair work performed the term substantial improvement does not however include either any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure variance means a grant of relief by the city commission to a person from the terms of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship a variance therefore permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article for full requirements see 44 cfr 606 violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter water surface elevation means the height in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum ngvd of 1988 or other datum where specified of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas    2 822010 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage    2 822010 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets  and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area    2 822010 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands    2 822010 lands to which article applies the article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the citys jurisdiction    2 822010 basis for establishing areas of special

neighborhood commercial district this c1 neighborhood commercial district is intended for a unified grouping in one or more buildings of retail shops and stores and personal services of limited size and service area that provide for the regular needs and are for the convenience of the citizens residing in the adjacent residential neighborhood where retail shops and personal services are not otherwise readily available because these shops and offices are lower intensity uses they may be designed to be located along arterial streets in close proximity to housing areas or as limited service facilities in larger planned high density housing areas this district is limited to the types of uses that will not cause an adverse impact ie noise lighting traffic upon the surrounding areas this district is also intended to reduce auto trips by permitting a limited group of commercial uses to be located in close proximity to residential areas it is intended that the suburban convenience center be developed as a unit with adequate offstreet parking space for customers and employees and with appropriate screening and landscaping b c2 limited office district this commercial district is intended primarily for business and professional offices that are compatible with residential use the district is suitable for business consulting executive or administrative offices which can occupy low rise structures in a low density landscaped setting this district is designed to serve as a transition zone between commercial and residential districts and to provide a district for office space without the more intensive retail uses of the commercial zone c c3 highway commercial district this c3 automotive and commercial recreation district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for establishments offering accommodations supplies or services to motorists and for certain specialized uses such as retail outlets extensive commercial amusement and service establishments which serve the entire community but do not and should not necessarily locate in more restrictive commercial districts all servicing of vehicles and assembly of equipment carried on as

passenger vehicles and only those trucks and commercial vehicles required for stocking and delivery of retail goods f cp planned shopping center district this cp planned shopping center district is established as a district intended for a unified grouping in one or more buildings of retail shops and stores that provide for the regular needs and are for the convenience of the people residing in the adjacent residential neighborhoods because of the varied uses permitted it is important to be separated as much as possible visually and physically from any nearby residential areas and to limit the harmful effects of increased traffic noise and general nonresidential activity which will be generated it is intended that the neighborhood shopping center be developed as a unit with adequate offstreet parking spaces for customers and employees and with appropriate landscaping and screening materials 1 area regulations the following shall apply to all uses permitted in this cp district

development herein referred to as pud is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls the pud may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan approval of a pud is not a substitute for platting property when required b the pud is subject to special review procedures once approved by the city commission it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents 1  exh 1 622014 intent and purpose a it is the intent of this section to encourage unified design of residential commercial industrial or institutional areas and facilities or combinations thereof and to provide for integrated development having harmony of design and variety of function it is also the intent of this section to encourage the development of planned commercial and industrial sites to eliminate the adverse impacts of traditional strip zoning b the purpose of the pud provision is to 1 encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use assuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan  2 permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site  3 encourage efficient use of land facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems and encourage diversified living environments and land uses  4 achieve a continuity of function and design within the development  5 to encourage innovative development of smaller parcels of land that have been passed over  and 6 provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health safety and welfare of the community 2  exh 1 622014 planned unit development authorized a a pud may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning districts map after public hearing by the planning commission and city commission a pud shall be considered a special zoning district  and it may be authorized for any use or a combination of uses permitted in this zoning code b a pud must comply with the following requirements a pud master plan is required as the basis for review and approval of a pud application the pud master plan shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning and shall be in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and the following 1 the pud master plan shall consist of two elements the design statement and the master development plan map  2 the pud master plan shall establish residential densities as well as amounts type and general location of all land uses  and 3 the pud master plan shall serve as the basis for review approval of all subdivision plats and building permits within the pud 3  exh 1 622014 effect of planned unit development approval a approval of a zoning change to pud adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as part of the application the master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use residential densities development regulations and location of specific elements of the development such as open space landscaping and screening b the pud classification replaces any previous zoning district classification on a parcel c where there is no provision in the pud master plan for special development regulations the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development 4  exh 1 622014 criteria for planned unit development review and approval because the pud provides the opportunity for higher densities greater design flexibility mixed land uses and improved marketability  the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development review and approval of a pud is therefore a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of these regulations and the comprehensive plan the following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a pud application other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals 1 the following design standards shall be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a pud application a purpose the proposed pud shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land use and zoning districts adjacent to it b design design of the pud may provide for modifications of any conventional zoning subdivision or other development standard requirements set forth in the this code in addition a unifiedmaster signage plan may be approved which modifies advertising and sign allowances provided that in no case shall the overall signage of a development exceed what would have been permissible under the standard code provisions if the development was not part of a pud c usage density land use and intensity of use requirements shall be based on the pud master plan and shall be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan d adherence to code building code requirements shall not be reduced or modified in the design of a pud e gross density the maximum number of dwelling units with a pud shall be based on calculation of gross density gross density shall be established in the pud master plan and shall be calculated

intensification are proposed useable open space should be furnished along with provision for its permanent retention and continued maintenance sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety i minimum land area and frontage the minimum area and frontage for a pud request involving office commercial and industrial land uses should generally be at least the minimum required by the conventional zoning associated with the proposal  provided that a private street network may also be authorized as a substitute for public street frontage j streets the following are general design standards for streets 1 street design should be innovative and should restrict from residential areas as much as possible 2 encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas such as the residential culdesac 3 development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions subject to approval of the city engineer however a private street system shall not serve as a reason for reduction in minimum design and paving standards in urban areas 4 onstreet parking bays or other

appropriate to specifically establish area with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area l mixed land use developments where a pud proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development the pud master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to ensure a harmonious development m common access in commercial or industrial developments the pud master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets 2 streets and alleys for puds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with city standards and specifications for
