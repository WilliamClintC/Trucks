at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates

facilities  sterling codifiers inc  75460 5 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view 6 the findings noted in subsections c1 c5 of this section raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the municipality it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the

prostitution and other sex related crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually

described in subsection j of this section d the home occupation shall be subordinate and incidental to the use of the dwelling unit as a residence among other considerations a home occupation will be considered to be subordinate and incidental if it occupies thirty five percent 35% or less of the gross square footage of all floors of the house including the basement such gross square footage shall not include the area of a garage accessory or ancillary building further the home occupation may be conducted anywhere within the house including the basement and within a garage located upon the same lot as a residence from which a home occupation is conducted in any ancillary building upon the property as defined in section 517 of this title for example if the total area of a house including all floors is equal to one thousand 1000 square feet the home occupation may occupy only three hundred fifty 350 square feet in order to be considered subordinate and incidental whether the home occupation itself is conducted within the house or in a garage three hundred fifty 350 square feet would be the maximum area that could be devoted to the home occupation  sterling codifiers inc

surround them especially those properties within one thousand feet 1000 of such businesses d studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and

how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the many services that are required after land has been subdivided and publicly recorded it is very difficult and costly to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision layout and in the facilities provided in addition a subdivided area sooner or later becomes a public responsibility the roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is affected in many important respects the guidance of land development regulation is therefore a matter of public concern it is in the interest of the public the developer and future owners that subdivisions be conceived and designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum
