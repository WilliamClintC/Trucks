405 are incorporated into and are enforceable under this title when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city athe city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following criteria 1the industrial user employs or demonstrates that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit 2the industrial user uses control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard without using dilution as a substitute for treatment 3sufficient information is provided to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions 4not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge 5consistent compliance with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ban industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the city whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates upon notification of a revised production rate the city will reassess the equivalent mass limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented under this section so long as they discharge under an equivalent mass limit cwhere the city chooses to establish equivalent mass limits it will 1calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2when notified of a revised production rate reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water concentration methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to 40 cfr 4036d and this title the industrial user must

special flood hazard areas athe building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed required openings stated in subsection b of this section because of hydrodynamic loads crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional such as a registered architect or professional engineer other types of foundations are recommended for these areas bthe crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation bfe and as such must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters the bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade cportions of the building below the bfe must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage this includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building but also any joists insulation or other materials that extend below the bfe the recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above bfe dany building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above bfe or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions ductwork in particular must either be placed above the bfe or sealed from floodwaters ethe interior grade of a crawlspace below the bfe must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade fthe height of the belowgrade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas gthere must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means hthe velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace for velocities in excess of five feet per second other foundation types should be used note for

reviewing authority shall be governed by the following criteria as it evaluates and renders a decision on a proposal 1statement of intent athe design review criteria are intended to provide a frame of reference for the applicant in the development of a site building and landscape plans as well as providing the city with a means of reviewing proposed plans bthese criteria are not intended to be inflexible requirements nor are they intended to discourage creativity the specification of one or more architectural styles is not intended by these criteria cthe reviewing authority is not authorized as a part of the design review process to approve projects which exceed specific development standards set forth by the applicable zone unless the exceptions are approved in accordance with specific variance or other provisions set forth in this chapter 2site design evaluation criteria a development shall make the most effective use possible of the site topography existing landscaping and building placement so as to preserve existing trees and natural features preserve vistas and other views from public ways minimize visibility of parking loading and storage areas from public ways and neighboring residential uses and to minimize intrusion into the character of existing developments and land uses in the immediate area the following are additional criteria that shall be used in evaluating site development plans athe arrangement of all functions uses and improvements has been designed so as to reflect and harmonize with the natural characteristics and limitations of the site and adjacent sites bin terms of setback from streets or sidewalks the design creates a visually interesting and compatible relationship between the proposed structures andor adjacent structures cthe design incorporates existing features such as streams rocks slopes vegetation and the like for example making use of a small stream rather than placing it in a culvert dwhere appropriate the design relates or integrates the proposed landscapingopen space to the adjoining landscapeopen space in order to create a pedestrianbike pathway andor open system that connects several properties or uses ethe arrangement of the improvements on the site does not unreasonably degrade the scenic values of the community and the surrounding area in particular fwhere appropriate the design includes a parking and circulation system that encourages pedestrian and bicycle traffic gthe design shall screen all storage mechanical equipment utilities andor waste collection facilities from view both from within and from outside the site hany proposed building with a footprint over 40000 square feet located in a commercial zone or a building with over 40000 square feet of retail area in an industrial zone shall comply with the special requirements as specified in  3landscape design evaluation criteria the following criteria shall be used in evaluating landscape plans athe overall design substantially complements the natural environment of the city and the character of the site and the surrounding area bthe design acknowledges the growing conditions for this climatic zone and the unique requirements that its specific site location makes upon plant selection cprovision has been made for the survival and continuous maintenance of the landscape and its vegetation dthe design contributes to the stabilization of slopes and the protection of other natural features and resources where applicable ethe design delineates and separates use areas where it is desirable to do so hrevision of plans construction documents plans drawings and specifications etc shall conform to all aspects of the approved design review plan where circumstances unknown or unforeseen at the time the plans are approved make it undesirable or unfeasible to comply with some particular aspect of the approved plan the applicant shall request in writing that the city review proposed modifications

modifications amajor modifications are those which result in a significant change in the initial plans the following are examples of major modifications changes in the siting of a building  modification of areas to be landscaped  and modifications to a plan element that was the subject of a design reviewing authority condition of approval bif the reviewing authority determines that the proposed change is a major modification the proposed alteration shall be reviewed and processed in the same manner as the original application and as a new application cthe fee shall be in accordance with the citys fee schedule 2minor modifications aminor modifications are those which result in an insignificant change in the initial plans examples are limited dimensional or locational changes to building elements such as windows or doors  changes in building materials where only a limited area is affected  and substitution of landscape materials which does not affect the overall landscape design bif the city determines that the proposed change is a minor modification the reviewing authority may proceed with the review of the plans  however if the reviewing authority is different than the original reviewing authority the original reviewing authority shall be notified of the proposed change and given an opportunity to comment relative thereto prior to final approval of such change
