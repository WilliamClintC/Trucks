the trip generation manual published by the institute of transportation engineers 4th or subsequent editions which is hereby adopted as though more fully set forth herein at length by the township to equal a pertrip cost for transportation improvements within the service area 2 the specific impact fee for a subdivision development or construction within the service area for road improvements shall be determined as of the land development plan filing date see  228 by multiplying the per trip cost established for the service area by the estimated number of trips to be generated by the subdivision development or construction using generally accepted traffic engineering standards 3 the board of commissioners may at its discretion authorize or require the preparation of a transportation study to determine traffic generation or circulation for a nonresidential development or construction to assist in the determination of the amount of the fee of such subdivision development or construction 4

subbasin 4 stormwater management plan the township is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the catasauqua creek release rate map presented in the plan the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the township office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is incorporated herein by this reference as appendix 1aa117 2 description of stormwater management districts three types of stormwater managements districts maybe applicable to the 117 editors note appendix 1aa is on file in the township offices  263 reserved  263  township namely conditional no detention i districts conditional no detention ii districts and duel release rate districts as described below a conditional no detention i districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this article the larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with 13 hereof any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in 3 hereof by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist b conditional no detention ii districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities must be calculated in the same manner as the conditional no detention i districts in such cases however adequate capacity must be demonstrated from the site to the lehigh river after determining if adequate capacity exists the developer shall use either no detention a 100% release rate or provide capacity improvements as detailed in 2a hereof c dual release rate districts within these districts the twoyear postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to 100% of the predevelopment peak c stormwater management district implementation provisions 1 any stormwater management controls required by this article and subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two  ten  twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in hereof  263 whitehall code  263  2 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two foot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slop to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 3 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this article shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual april 1990 permissible velocities from the dep manual for selected channels are presented in appendix 1ac of this article118 b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff 4 for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 5 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan 118 editors note appendix 1ac is included at the end of this chapter  263 reserved  263  changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate 6 for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention subarea in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention subarea 7 within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has significant areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be lessor of a the total development site runoff times the applicable release rate b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site 8 offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site 9 where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria 10 development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site are not subject to the release rate provisions of the 11 noharm option a noharm option for any proposed development site not located in a conditional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specification in 3 hereof if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification  263 whitehall code  263  b attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions  the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two  ten  twentyfiveand onehundredyear shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff models for the catasauqua creek watershed and the watersheds associated with several unnamed creeks for the conditional no detention ii areas the psuiv peak flow values will be sued these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the municipal engineer upon request  any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if the developers site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreages the developer may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity  developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would be definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with 13 hereof c any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per  264 hereof 12 regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basis must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas as used herein the phrase hydrologic model refers to the calibrated version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the stormwater management plan 13 capacity improvements  263 reserved  263  a in certain instances primarily within the conditional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in such instances if the developer can prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations are to be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in 3 hereof all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any b capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream 14waiver of runoff control based on minimum additional impervious cover any proposed

coplay creek release rate map presented in the plan the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the township office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is incorporated herein by this reference as appendix 1ba125 2 description of stormwater management districts three types of stormwater managements districts maybe applicable to the township namely conditional no detention i districts conditional no detention ii districts and dual release rate districts as described below a conditional no detention i districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  2610 must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing 125 editors note appendix 1ba is on file in the township offices  2611 reserved  2611  condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this article the larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  2610 these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with 9 any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in 3 by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist b conditional no detention ii districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities must be calculated in the same manner as the conditional no detention i districts in such cases however adequate capacity must be demonstrated from the site to the lehigh river after determining if adequate capacity exists the developer shall use either no detention a 100% release rate or provide capacity improvements as detailed in 2a  conditional no detention i districts c dual release rate districts within this district the twoyear postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the tenyear twentyfiveyear and onehundredyear postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the tenthrough onehundredyear events are either 90% or 100% depending upon location in the watershed c stormwater management district implementation provisions 1 any stormwater management controls required by this article and subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two  ten  twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in 2 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the  2611 whitehall code  2611  district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the watercourse and the downstream subarea boundary is drawn from that point upslope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 3 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this article shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual april 1990 permissible velocities for selected channels are presented in appendix 1bc of this article126 amended 882005 by  b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff peak within their banks or otherwise not create any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must have sufficient capacity to pass or convey the increased flows associated with the twentyfiveyear return period runoff event except for facilities located within a designated floodplain area which must be capable of passing or conveying the onehundredyear return period runoff any facilities which constitute stream enclosures per deps regulations shall be designed to convey the onehundredyear return period runoff amended 882005 by  4 for a proposed development site located within only one release rate category area the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple points of concentrated runoff discharge individual drainage points may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 5 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category areas the maximum peak rate of runoff that may 126 editors note appendix 1bc is included at the end of this chapter  2611 reserved  2611  be discharged at any point is limited to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff at that point multiplied by the applicable release rate the control rates shall apply regardless of any grading modifications which may change the drainage area which discharges at a given point 6 for a proposed development sites located partially within a release rate category area and partially within a provisional no detention area in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention area 7 noharm option a for any proposed development site not located in a provisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specification in 3 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions  the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two  ten twentyfiveand onehundredyear shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff models for the coplay creek rockdale creek fells creek and spring creek watersheds and the watersheds associated with the unnamed creek north of the rockdale creek for the conditional no detention ii areas the psuiv peak flow values will be discussed these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the township engineer upon request  any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity  developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful  2611 whitehall code  2611  attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with 9 hereof b any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per  2612 hereof 8 regional or subregional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility an entire subarea group of subareas or portion of a subarea incorporating more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional or subregional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated versions of the penn state runoff model as developed for the stormwater management plan 9 capacity improvements in certain instances primarily within the provisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in such instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site any capacity improvements would be designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and the capacity criteria specified in 3 in addition all new development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with this article except that all new development within the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to document the validity of a less stringent discharge control which would not create any harm downstream 10waiver of runoff control based on minimum additional impervious cover any proposed regulated activity except those defined in 5 and 6 which would create 10000 square

the jordan creek stormwater management plan the township is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the jordan creek release rate map presented in the plan the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the township office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is incorporated herein by this reference as appendix 1ca131 for general reference 2 description of stormwater management districts three types of stormwater managements districts maybe applicable to the township namely provisional no detention districts 100% release rate districts and dual release rate districts as described below a provisional no detention districts these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities without adversely affecting the total watershed peak flow in certain instances however the local runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff from the site to the main channel may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a proposed development in those instances the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  2619c9 in determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this article similarly any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  2619c3 b onehundredpercent release rate districts these watershed areas must implement a 100% release rate for each of the two  ten  twentyfive and onehundredyear return period storm events areas with a 100% release rate strategy form a buffer between provisional no detention areas and dual release rate areas described below c dual release rate districts the anticipated postdevelopment runoff from these areas can only be controlled across the range of return periods from two years by implementing a dual system of release rates within this district the twoyear postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the tenyear twentyfiveyear and onehundredyear postdevelopment 131 editors note appendix 1ca is on file in the township offices  2619 reserved  2619  runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the tenthrough onehundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed c stormwater management district implementation provisions 1 any stormwater management controls required by this article and subject to a 100% release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two  ten  twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  2619d stormwater management controls intended to be designed consistent with  2619d 2 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two foot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature acts as a downstream limit of the watercourse and the downstream subarea boundary is drawn from that point upslope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 3 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this article shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual april 1990 or subsequent amendments permissible velocities for selected channels are presented in appendix 3cc of this article132 amended 882005 by  b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff peak within their banks or otherwise not create any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must have sufficient capacity to pass or convey the increased flows 132 editors note appendix 3cc is included at the end of this chapter  2619 whitehall code  2619  associated with the twentyfiveyear return period runoff event except for facilities located within a designated floodplain area which must be capable of passing or conveying the onehundredyear return period runoff any facilities which constitute stream enclosures per deps regulations shall be designed to convey the onehundredyear return period runoff amended 882005 by  4 for a proposed development site located within only one release rate category area the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple points of concentrated runoff discharge individual drainage points may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 5 for a proposed development site located within two or more release rate category areas the maximum peak rate of runoff that may be discharged at any point is limited to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff at that point multiplied by the applicable release rate the control rates shall apply regardless of any grading modifications which may change the drainage area which discharges at a given point 6 for a proposed development sites located partially within a release rate category area and partially within a provisional no detention area in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention area 7 noharm option a for any proposed development site not located in a provisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the jordan creek with the little lehigh creek proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  2619c3 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions  the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two  ten  twentyfiveand onehundredyear shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff model for the jordan creek  2619 reserved  2619  watershed these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the township engineer upon request  any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity  developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at undocumented storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  2619c9 b any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per  2620 hereof 8 regional or subregional detention alternatives for certain areas within the watershed it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for an entire subarea group of subareas or portion of a subarea incorporating more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional or subregional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on the casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated jordan creek version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the stormwater management plan 9 capacity improvements in certain instances primarily within the provisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in such instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network when the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site any capacity improvements would be designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and the capacity criteria specified in  2619c3 in addition all new development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with this article except that all new  2619 whitehall code  2619  development within the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to document the validity of a less stringent discharge control which would not create any harm downstream 10waiver of runoff control based on minimum
