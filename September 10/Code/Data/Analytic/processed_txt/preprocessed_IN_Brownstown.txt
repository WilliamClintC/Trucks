legislature has in ic 361411 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the town council of the town of brownstown does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations adopted  effective  b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of brownstown are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages adopted  effective  c purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters floodplain regulations title xv title 15 zoning of brownstown indiana 55 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program d objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health 2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas 15402 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give
