ordinances of perrysburg ohio  charter part two  administration four  traffic six  general offenses eight  business regulation and taxation ten  streets utilities and public services twelve  planning and zoning fourteen  building and housing sixteen  fire prevention s note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable

an overtaking watercraft and no subsequent alteration of bearing between the two watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing watercraft within the meaning of these rules or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken watercraft until it is finally passed and clear if the overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether it is forward of or abaft this direction from the other watercraft it should assume that it is an overtaking watercraft and yield the right of way 8 in rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water current the descending watercraft shall have the right of way over a watercraft which is ascending 9 when a powercraft and a rowboat are proceeding in such direction as to involve the risk of collision such powercraft shall yield the

accepting a gift of money from the estate of willard v way council created a board of trustees of seven members as follows mayor of the village ex officio  president of the board of education exofficio  three members appointed by council and two members appointed by the board of education this composition continued until 1954 when the state librarian published a report of a survey of the way public library which was requested by the league of women voters the report of the state librarian stated that there is no law now in force nor was there any law in force at the time of passage of the original ordinance in 1881 giving a village council authority to delegate the power of appointment of library trustees to other agencies the report concluded that this was the only library in the state in which the board members were appointed in such fashion and that the library did not appear to be a unit of the village board of education township or county it was recommended that the board of library trustees be appointed pursuant to ohio rc 337512 so that the board would have the powers now granted by law to legally organized public library boards and in the event of a future tax levy or bond issue it should belong to the municipality the report resulted in the present board being appointed pursuant to ohio rc 337512 there are no sections in this chapter has been established to
