i  in general purpose to provide for the health safety and general welfare of the public and in response to the unfunded federal mandate the city finds it necessary to adopt standards concerning erosion control postconstruction stormwater pollution prevention and other provisions related to the regulation of earthmoving excavation and stormwater discharge this chapter provides methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 in order to comply with the requirements of the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit process specifically the city has found that soil erosion resulting from nonagricultural land disturbing activities may cause a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported offsite to locations including adjacent properties public streets storm sewer structures ditches streams wetlands lakes and rivers furthermore the proper installation and operation of stormwater management measures is necessary to ensure that soil erosion and stormwater quality issues do not arise after the completion of a land disturbing activity the regulation of land disturbing activities will minimize the amount of sediment and other pollutants resulting from soil erosion due to land disturbing activities from being transported off site to adjacent public or private lands it will also minimize erosion and stormwater quality issues that arise due to the longterm operation of the site after construction this chapter applies to nonagricultural land disturbing activities including industrial commercial institutional residential utility and roadway development the objectives of this chapter are 1 to regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal drainageways ponds lakes and other stormwater receivers 2 to regulate the contribution of pollutants to municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 by stormwater discharges by any user 3 to reduce the potential negative impact of land disturbing activities on adjacent properties and the public at large 4 to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter 5 to minimize or reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels and to continue to enforce no net increase of stormwater runoff from newly developed sites 6 to minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which could otherwise

therefore the city of mishawaka common council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations   1art 1  a 1142015 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages   1art 1  b 1142015 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program   1art 1  c 1142015 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health 2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize floodblight areas   1art 1  d 1142015 secs 121512126  reserved article ii  definitions secs 12127  definitions unless
