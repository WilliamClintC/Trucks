middle class tax relief and job creation act of 201 pub l 11296 codified as 47 usc a a generally requires that state and local governments may not deny and shall approve requests to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station federal communication commission fcc regulations interpret this statute and establish procedural rules for local review which generally preempt certain subjective landuse regulations limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential deemedgranted remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within 60 days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified as 47 usc applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment a applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg cellular wifi satellite microwave backhaul etc 2 the city council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values the city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with a contained in a section devoted to a will mitigate such potential confusion streamline local review and preserve the citys landuse authority to maximum extent possible 3 this section establishes reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health safety and welfare consistent with and subject to federal and california state law for wireless facilities collocations and modifications

already deployed on the ground substantial change the same as defined by the fcc in 47 cfr b7 or any successor regulation which defines that term differently based on the type of eligible support structure tower or base station and location in or outside the prow for clarity this definition organizes the fccs criteria and thresholds for determining if a collocation or modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of a wireless tower or base station based on the type and location 1 for towers outside the prow a substantial change occurs when a the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height of the tower by more than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet whichever is greater  or b the proposed collocation or modification adds an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  or c the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed 4  or d the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower including any access or utility easements currently related to the site 2 for towers in the prow and for all base stations a substantial change occurs when a the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height of the tower more than 10% or 10 feet whichever is greater  or b the proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the tower or base station by more than 6 feet  or c the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new groundmounted equipment cabinets when there are no preexisting groundmounted equipment cabinets associated with the structure  or d the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new groundmounted equipment cabinets that are more than 10% larger in height or overall volume than any other existing groundmounted equipment cabinets  or e the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground 3 in addition for all towers and base stations wherever located a substantial change occurs when a the proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the eligible support structure wireless tower or base station as reasonably determined by the director  or b the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval  provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height width equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section 4 for purposes of this definition changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally such as on buildings rooftops  in other circumstances changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the spectrum act tower the same as defined by the fcc in 47 cfr b9 or any successor regulation which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting

sewer wdrs issued by the california regional water quality control boardsanta ana region santa ana rwqcb and as a permittee under the sewer wdrs the city is required to adopt chapters and implement procedures to reduce the amount of fats oils and grease fog discharged into the citys sanitary sewer collection system c iii of the sewer wdrs requires the city to demonstrate that it possesses the legal authority necessary to control discharges of fog to and from those portions of the citys sanitary sewer collection system over which it has jurisdiction so as to comply with the sewer wdrs d fses or food facilities as defined in california uniform retail food facilities law curffl division 104 environmental health retail food articles 120 of the california health & safety fses produce fog as a byproduct of their operations which if not properly managed and disposed create the potential for blockage of sanitary sewer lines and which can result in damage to both public and private property and sewage overflows that cause health issues and have the potential to pollute beaches and water courses in the city as well as in other portions of orange county e studies in orange county have concluded that fog is one of the primary causes of sanitary sewer blockages based on information collected by the santa ana rwqcb sanitary sewer system overflows ssos within orange county from sewer collection systems have caused numerous beach closures and the most prevalent cause of the ssos is fog accumulation in the small to medium sewer lines serving fses f the current edition of the uniform plumbing fses that have the potential to produce a significant amount of fog to have grease control devices many fses such as restaurants within the city do not have grease control devices these commercial fses have the potential to require the city and sanitation districts to perform additional preventive maintenance on sewer lines that service these facilities as well as respond to and cleanup blockages and sewage overflows caused by improper fog disposal practices and grease control device maintenance g the purpose of this chapter is to facilitate the maximum beneficial public use of the citys sanitary sewer collection system while preventing blockages of sewer lines resulting from discharges of fog to the system and to specify appropriate fog discharge requirements for

insoluble waste discharges from fses into the citys sewer system j to comply with federal state and local policies and to allow the city to meet applicable standards provisions are made in this chapter for the regulation of wastewater or waste containing fog discharges to the sewer facilities k certain fses within the boundaries of the city do not discharge wastewater into the citys sewer system and facilities and discharge into sewer systems and facilities operated by regulatory agencies and sanitation districts other than the city such fses will be permitted and regulated by regulatory agencies other than the city in order to avoid the possibility of overlapping and potentially contradictory regulation of such fses this chapter is not intended to apply to fses or other dischargers which do not discharge into the citys sanitary sewer system l this chapter establishes quantity and quality standards on all wastewater andor waste discharges containing fog which may alone or collectively cause or contribute to fog accumulation in the sewer facilities causing or potentially causing or contributing to the occurrence of ssos   definitions a unless otherwise defined

floodplain management  statutory authority the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of seal beach does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privatelyowned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development that may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas   definitions

surface elevation more than one foot fraud and victimization as related to this chapter means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public in examining this requirement the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring in addition future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential

structures contain a basement   variance procedure a nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions of variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the orange county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency c appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of c are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  grading  definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases shall mean approved plans the current grading plans bearing the city engineers stamp of

 purpose a the state legislature has found that 1 the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  2 the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use of water b the city hereby finds that 1 orange county has an established large reclaimed water infrastructure system  2 allocationbased and tiered water rate structures allow public agencies to document water use in landscapes  3 incentivebased water use efficiency programs have been actively implemented within orange county since before 1991  4 current local design practices in new landscapes typically achieve the state model water efficient landscape use goals  5 all water services within the city are metered and billed based on volume of use  6 orange county is a leader in researching and promoting the use of smart irrigation controllers with more than 12900 installations as of june 2009 and promotion of sustainable landscape transformation with more than 30000000 square feet of turf removal  7 all new irrigation controllers sold after 2012 within orange county will be smart irrigation controllers  8 landscape plan submittal and review has been a long standing practice in seal beach  9 the average rainfall in orange county is approximately 12 inches per year  10 the city as the local water purveyor has implemented a tiered rate billing program and endorses water waste prohibitions for all existing metered landscaped areas throughout its service area which includes the city of seal beach in its entirety  and 11 the city has determined based upon the written and oral testimony that this chapter is substantially equivalent to the state model water efficient landscape consistent with these findings the purpose of the citys water efficient landscape to establish an alternative model acceptable under governor browns  drought executive order b1925 as being at least as effective as the state model water efficient landscape the context of conditions in the city in order to 1 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies  2 promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and other resources as efficiently as possible  3 establish a structure for planning designing installing and maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects  4 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  5 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  and 6 encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water such as implementing a budgetbased tieredrate structure providing rebate incentives and offering educational programs     applicability a this water efficient landscape apply to the
