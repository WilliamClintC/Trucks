there are no objectionable secondary consequences the city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results some alternatives are to 1 avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious 2 avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections 3 provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of

constitution of north carolina  the charter of the city of newton  north carolina general statutes 1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder  session law 2004163   185 sedimentation pollution control  floodway regulation  planning and regulation of development  and  6192007 findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the city of newton to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this chapter therefore the newton city council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge  6192007 purpose a general the purpose of this chapter is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this chapter seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2 requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater best management practices bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7 establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance 8 coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with applicable land development plans which have been adopted by the newton city council 9 controlling illicit

systems and designed with due regard for safety appearance and geological effects aboveground drainageways shall be located and constructed to maintain a natural appearance shall be limited to safe water depths in easily accessible areas and shall be designed to avoid excessive rates of flow erosion or overflow into developed areas subject to damage in circumstances where the impact of new drainage would be likely to damage or destroy significant existing natural water areas as described in subsection b of this section such drainage shall not be discharged into such areas e protection from flooding and other adverse water conditions no subdivision shall be so located or improved as to create impoundments of surface water on developable upstream lands outside the subdivision or to increase surface drainage flow across developable downstream lands other than in approved drainageways  to cause erosion on or to neighboring property or into water areas  or to raise or lower groundwater levels in a manner which creates adverse effects within the subdivision or in surrounding areas where location of improvements appears likely to have such effects plats shall not be approved until suitable remedial measures have been provided such measures may include as appropriate to the circumstances participation in provision of necessary enlargements or improvements in offsite drainageways establishment of water retention and recharge areas and mechanical and vegetative means to control runoff and erosion from the subdivision    blocks a general design criteria

in excess of that depth are for the purpose of providing separation from major streets or railroads nonaccess reservations easements or marshes or water areas or protective strips pertaining thereto the depthwidth ratio shall not apply in cases where the width of a lot exceeds 300 feet for its entire depth and it may be increased by the srb in individual cases where it finds good cause b minimum dimensions minimum lot dimensions shall be as specified in the zoning ordinance for uses on which such limitations are indicated subject to increases as required by the appropriate county health department for residential lots not served by public water supply and public sanitary sewerage depth and width of lots subdivided for nonresidential purposes shall be adequate for offstreet parking

public water andor sanitary sewerage is not provided they shall also conform to the minimum area requirements set by the appropriate county health department c access to streets each lot created in a subdivision shall have direct access of at least 20 feet in width to a street which is either an existing public street or one which upon completion of installation can be accepted by the state or one of its political subdivisions for continual maintenance however limited access highways which provide no direct access to abutting properties shall not be considered streets for the purposes of this section d double frontage and reversed frontage lots in general double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide residential separation from traffic arteries to overcome other disadvantages of orientation or topography or to provide protection for adjacent uses a planting screen easement of at least ten feet shall be provided along the line of lots abutting traffic arteries or other disadvantageous uses across which there shall be no right of access unless specifically authorized by the srb the screening shall be installed by the subdivider

network of public sites and open spaces  statement of intent to provide for efficiency economy and amenity it is the intent of this chapter to encourage and promote the development and maintenance of public open space systems within urban services districts in other sections of the country it is recognized that the existence of assured permanent open space reduces need for formal planning for the open space system described herein but the same principles embodied in the balance of this subsection shall apply where density of development makes such treatment appropriate it is intended that to the maximum extent reasonably feasible there shall be a continuous network of public lands adapted to multiple purposes as follows preservation and maintenance of natural waterways and water areas

to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life safety and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area  872007 general provisions a lands to which this chapter
