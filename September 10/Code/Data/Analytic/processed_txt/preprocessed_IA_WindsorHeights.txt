department of natural resources idnr requires that cities meeting certain demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the idnr an npdes permit for the discharge of storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 ms4 permit the city of windsor heights is subject to the program and is required to obtain and has obtained an ms4 permit  the citys ms4 permit is on file at the office of the city clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours 2 as a condition of the citys ms4 permit the city is obliged to develop implement adopt and enforce a postconstruction storm water control ordinance 3 no state or federal funds have been made available to assist the city in administering and enforcing the program accordingly the city shall fund its operations under this chapter entirely by charges imposed on the owners or developers of properties which are made subject to the program by virtue of state and federal law andor other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance 4 land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition if left uncontrolled  this uncontrolled storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of storm water runoff from development sites 5 therefore city establishes this set of city storm water requirements applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety 6 the iowa
