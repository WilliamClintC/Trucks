adjacent to high traffic generators commonly found abutting arterial roadways or expressways the standards herein are intended to promote a variety of housing types in particular special standards are provided for elderly housing in recognition of the need for such facilities and their relatively low impacts on traffic and infrastructure in comparison with other types of multiple family uses at a similar density the standards are further intended to ensure ample open space to complement such uses and the overall character of the township 4 mobile home  manufactured housing park district the intent of the manufactured housing park district is to provide an affordable housing alternative where appropriate and consistent with the general character of the township the standards of this district are intended to be consistent with the standards for other types of housing at similar densities in addition to the standards of this all manufactured housing park developments shall comply with act no 96 of public acts of the state of michigan of 1987 as amended however some standards of this more stringent than the typical standards promoted by the michigan mobile home commission these more stringent standards reflect the nature of grand blanc charter township in contrast with some other areas of michigan where the universal rules of the mobile home commission may be appropriate these standards encourage development which complements and protects the investment on adjacent properties and promotes preservation of important natural features 5 office service district the office service district os is designed to develop high quality commercial areas devoted primarily to office uses with a limited number of related uses the office service districts are intended to serve as transitional areas between residential areas and commercial districts and to provide low intensity uses along lots with frontage along high traffic volume arterial roadways abutting residential neighborhoods the uses permitted within this district are intended to operate primarily during daylight hours creating less intrusive impact than other types of offices and commercial uses which tend to disrupt residential areas the list of uses permitted and other standards of this section are established to protect the investment of nearby homeowners and other offices in the district by limiting outdoor activities and incompatible land uses uses which have potential to be intrusive in some os locations are treated as special land uses to allow the planning commission to evaluate if a specific location is appropriate 6 professional office district the professional office po districts are intended to accommodate large office buildings restricted retail research and educational facilities which serve large numbers of people a major purpose of this district is to provide attractive settings to create office campus environments which are attractive and typically visible from freeways or arterial roadways areas zoned professional office district are intended to be predominantly office in nature but allow related commercial and service uses to serve office employees and visitors 7 health care district the health care district hcd is established to accommodate and direct the development of hospitals to serve as the nucleus of a health care campus the uses permitted within this district are intended to provide a convenient and efficient health care delivery system for the region in addition to hospitals the health care district permits development of closely related services such as medical offices housing for the elderly and special needs groups  and health care professionals  and limited retail and various types of health care related services the health care district designations allow development on these related uses in a coordinated fashion within a single zoning district one goal of this district is to minimize traffic and other impacts by coordinating development of these related uses though campus master planning this district requires an impact study to assist the township in evaluating the appropriateness of the zoning and conceptual design

retail business and services to meet the daytoday convenience shopping and service needs primarily for nearby residential neighborhoods these districts are located to concentrate such uses as recommended in the township master plan the purpose of these carefully located districts is to prevent excessive commercial strip developments which may deteriorate traffic operations and safety create unattractive roadway corridors and eventually lead to blight the townships ordinances particularly regarding setbacks parking signs lighting dumpster enclosure and landscaping are intended to help ensure that neighborhood commercial uses remain compatible with the predominant residential character of the surrounding neighborhoods and the township overall some uses which typically serve the surrounding neighborhood may be more intrusive to adjacent districts these uses are treated as special land uses to allow the planning commission to determine appropriate locations within these districts 9 general commercial district the general commercial district is established to accommodate those retail businesses and services which are intended to serve the requirements of the grand blanc community and bypass traffic area the large size and variety of permitted commercial uses typically generates significant volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic general commercial uses require a relatively large area devoted to offstreet parking and loading and generally tend to create problems of congestion noise and impairment of aesthetic values thus these districts are generally located along expressway interchanges and regional arterial roadways one purpose of these districts is to direct all intensive commercial uses to these concentrated areas rather than allowing inefficient scattering of such development the townships ordinances particularly regarding setbacks parking signs lighting landscaping and driveway spacing standards are intended to help ensure long term viability of the major commercial areas in the township uses which may generate significant impacts on adjacent uses or infrastructure are treated as special land uses to allow the planning commission to determine appropriate locations within these districts 10 research and development the research and development districts rd as herein established are intended to provide for a community of research and related facilities while specifically excluding incongruous uses the uses permitted within this district are distinct from other industrial districts since the uses are generally lower intensity with minimal impacts outside of the principal buildings the rd districts are also intended to permit uses which manufacture process package assemble or treat finished or semifinished products from materials prepared outside rd districts accessory uses which complement and support the principal uses and are intended for use by employees and visitors of the principal uses are allowed when meeting the standards of this district the standards of this district particularly setbacks and landscaping standards are designed to promote compatibility between the research operations and the character of surrounding uses the intentional prohibition of outdoor storage and prohibition of raw materials processing for finished products or for shipment in bulk form to be used in an industrial operation at another location is intended to help meet this goal 11 light industrial district the i1 industrial districts are designed so as to primarily accommodate industrial parks

crashes and congestion while maintaining safe and reasonable access to adjoining properties in its review and approval of land development plans grand blanc charter township has a key role to play in implementing effective access management the township unlike the operative road agency or agencies is in a position to directly coordinate the internal layout of a site with the location and design of its access drives the effective exercise of this capability enhances public health safety and welfare the intent of this to establish access management standards to be followed in developing or rehabilitating sites within the township 2 applicability the standards within this a along all highways roads and streets within the township classified as collectors and above on the current township

regular traffic and emergency vehicles based on traffic engineering and fire department reviews as well as a traffic impact study if submitted according to  c driveway location must provide adequate sight distance and reasonable approach grades and should generally not result in a return or radius encroaching on the frontage of a neighboring parcel such encroachment will be permitted only with the written consent of the neighboring property owner or when found by the township road commission or mdot to be necessary to preserve traffic safety d the minimum desirable sameside spacing between a driveway and an intersection may be greater than the minimum spacing between driveways but should never be less depending on traffic conditions eg backups from a signal as well as designated lane uses driveways should generally not be permitted on the approach to an intersection opposite or only a short distance upstream of a dedicated leftturn lane for the intersection e on roads lacking a raised nontraversable median leftturn conflicts should be avoided by either aligning or sufficiently offsetting driveways on opposite sides of the road the minimum oppositeside driveway spacing is generally more critical when the direction of offset will result in interlocking entering left turns and this direction of offset may have to be larger for highervolume driveways f site plans should incorporate where feasible and appropriate crossaccess with neighboring sites via connected parking aisles or frontage roads shared side service drives andor site access drives and rear service drives connecting to side roads any such crossaccess should be supported by generalpurpose unrestricted easements as well as agreements regarding maintenance responsibilities g driveway location insufficient driveway spacing andor sitespecific traffic conditions may warrant the posting of a driveway as oneway or the prohibition of certain vehicle turns entering or exiting a site warranted turn

distribution models the methods used to distribute sitegenerated traffic among specific movements at the site drives and various offsite intersections evaluated should be explained in some detail for instance it is insufficient to simply state that the trip distribution modeling is based on existing traffic patterns  the superficial application of this concept may result in all trips being modeled as if they were passby trips generally new primary trips should be modeled separately from passby trips since the former return to their origin by definition as opposed to exiting in the direction
