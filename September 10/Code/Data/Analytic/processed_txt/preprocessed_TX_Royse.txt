definitions for purposes of this section 1 public infrastructure improvement means a water wastewater roadway drainage or park facility that is a part of one or more of the citys public facilities systems 2 public facilities system means the collection of water wastewater roadway drainage or park facilities owned or operated by or in behalf of the city for the purpose of providing services to the public including existing and new developments b purpose applicability & effect 1 purpose the purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the citys public facilities systems 2 applicability an appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land to construct improvements or to pay development fees other than impact fees for a public infrastructure improvement which requirement is imposed under the citys subdivision regulations whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards or is imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision c proportionality determination by city engineer prior to a decision by the planning and zoning commission on a preliminary plat application or if no preliminary plat application is authorized on a final plat application the city engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the citys public facilities systems taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed    383652 1 in making his proportionality determination the city engineer may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to onsite improvements  the proposed or potential use of the land  the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities  impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the citys public facilities systems  the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development  the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments  the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements  any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible  or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the citys public facilities systems 2 based upon his proportionality determination the city engineer shall affirm that the public infrastructure improvement requirements of the subdivision regulations do not impose costs on the developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the city in providing public facilities to serve the development 3 the city engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination required by this subsection d commission determination the commission shall take into account the citys engineers report concerning the proportionality of public infrastructure improvement requirements to be applied to a proposed preliminary or final plat application as the case may be in making its decision on the plat application and shall identify any variation to the requirements that are to be included as conditions to plat approval e appeals 1 who may appeal an appeal to the city council under this section may be filed by a property owner or the applicant for a preliminary or final plat in which a requirement to dedicate land for construct or pay a fee other than an impact fee for a public infrastructure improvement has been applied or attached as a condition of approval or as grounds for denying the plat application 2 time for filing and request for extension of time the appeal shall be filed in

longer time is requested a total capacity of the citys water wastewater roadway drainage or park system to be utilized by the proposed development employing standard measures of capacity and

information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed including any phases already developed    384652 b total capacity to be supplied to the citys water wastewater roadway drainage or park facilities system by the dedication of an interest in land construction of improvements or fee contribution if the plat application is proposed as a phased development the information shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedication construction or fee payments c comparison of the capacity of the citys public facilities systems to be consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such systems by the proposed dedication of an interest in land construction of improvements or fee payment in making this comparison the impacts on the citys public facilities systems from the entire development shall be considered d the amount of any city participation in the costs of oversizing the public infrastructure improvement to be constructed in

a recommendation with the county responsible for reviewing plats in the county h decision the city council shall decide the appeal in conjunction with its decision on the plat application the council shall base its decision on the criteria listed in subsection h i and may take one of the following actions 1 deny the appeal and impose the standard or condition on the plat application in accordance with the city engineers recommendation or the planning and zoning commissions decision on the plat  or 2 deny the appeal upon finding that the proposed dedication construction or fee requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the subdivision on the public facilities system for water wastewater roadway drainage or park improvements and either deny the plat application or require that additional public infrastructure improvements be made as a condition of approval of the application  or 3 grant the appeal and waive in whole or in part any dedication construction or fee requirement

essential component of the citys street network and are necessary to accommodate the continuing growth and development of the city    395652 3 it is necessary and desirable to obtain rightsofway for offsite abutting and internal thoroughfares to support new development at the time of platting or development of the land 4 there must be rough proportionality between the traffic impacts created by a new development and requirements placed on the property owner to dedicate and improve offsite abutting and internal thoroughfare rightsofway to city standards 5 the city desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated of thoroughfare rightsofway and improvements and that a development project contribute not more than its fair share of thoroughfare costs 6 it is the citys intent to
