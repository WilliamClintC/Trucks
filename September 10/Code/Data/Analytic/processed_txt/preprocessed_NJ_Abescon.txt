chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed a the flood hazard areas of absecon city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a to protect human life and health b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d to minimize prolonged business interruptions e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for

hazard  1951 general provisions  1953   1954 methods of reducing flood losses 4 in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for h to ensure that those who occupy

retain and detain the increased accelerated runoff which the development generates water should be released from detention facilities into a watercourse or wetlands at a rate and in a manner
