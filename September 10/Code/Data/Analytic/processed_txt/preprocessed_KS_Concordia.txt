a statutory authorization 1 the following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare 3 after notice and public hearing as provided by of the zoning regulations of the city of concordia the concordia planning commission has recommended that the zoning regulations be amended as set forth herein b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of concordia kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 192 c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in 1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603b and kar 5 444 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard general provisions a lands
