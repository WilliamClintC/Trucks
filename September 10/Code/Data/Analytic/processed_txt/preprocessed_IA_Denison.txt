intent the city council makes the following findings and adopts the following statement of purposes 1the citys street and alley rightsofway are owned or held by the city primarily for the purpose of pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the citys provision of essential public safety services including police fire and emergency medical response services  and public health services including sanitary sewer water and storm drainage services 2pedestrian and vehicular passage and the public safety and public health services mentioned in subsection 1 of this section should in all cases be considered and treated as the dominant and preeminent uses of public rightsofway 3all other uses of public rightsofway including use for the provision of utility services private communication services and private utility services must in all cases be subordinate to the use of the rightsofway for pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the provision of the public safety and public health services mentioned in subsection 1 of this section 4in order to provide for the health safety and wellbeing of its citizens as well as to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the use of the rightsofway the city strives to keep its rightsofway in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rightsofway a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rightsofway is their frequent excavation by persons whose equipment is located therein 5rightofway obstructions disrupt

gain this property held by the city for the public good although such services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens such persons receive revenue andor profit use of public property 7the city council finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the payment of rightofway permit fees by all persons using and occupying the rightofway for the purpose of operating their businesses this provides equity by requiring all noncity users of the rightofway to pay compensation to the city so that it may recoup the costs imposed on the city attributable to such use 14102

in the city of denison and its extraterritorial jurisdiction this section is intended to provide guidance for applying the regulators contained in these tables 1site area per housing unit this indicates the gross land area per unit within a residential development for example a 40lot subdivision on a 10acre 435600 square foot tract will have a site area per unit of 10890 square feet site area per unit which measures gross density may differ from minimum lot size in conservation development the site area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size permitting the clustering of lots in exchange for common open space in multifamily development the site area per unit will usually be smaller than minimum lot size because the lot is the legal parcel on which a multipleunit building is built 2minimum lot area this indicates the minimum size of a legally described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place as noted above minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same 3minimum lot width this is the required minimum distance connecting at points along opposite side lot lines measured at the required front yard setback for example the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring a 25foot front yard setback is determined by alocating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25 feet back from the front property line bdrawing a line connecting these two points cmeasuring the length of this line the length is the lot width 4minimum yards these define the required setbacks of buildings from front side and rear property lines while the yard requirements apply to a majority of development the ordinance provides for a number of exceptions some of these include aplanned developments front yard setbacks can be varied within planned developments which are reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission bmajor streets the city may require greater than normal setbacks along segments of the citys arterial street system as defined in the comprehensive development plan cflexibility provided by supplemental development regulations establishes supplemental regulations many of which provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts dmaximum setbacks some specific zoning districts provide maximum as well as minimum setbacks these setbacks establish buildto lines that may be necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts 5maximum height height normally measures the vertical distance from the established grade to the highest point of a building however as established by the definition of height the point of measurement may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes 6maximum building coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by the footprint of buildings thus a 20000 square foot building on a 40000 square foot site has a building coverage of 50% this is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area 7maximum impervious coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground such as driveways porches parking lots and other features limits on impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of storm water runoff and provide for groundwater recharge 8floor area ratio just as site area per unit controls the density of residential development floor area ration far controls the density of nonresidential development far is the ratio of gross floor area of a building to total site area thus in an area with a maximum permitted far of 10 a 40000 square foot building may be located on a 40000 square foot site naturally because of coverage ratios landscaping and parking requirements such a building will be multistory 9 maximum amount of total parking in street yard this controls the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building facade and the street when applied in certain zoning districts it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from the street encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and side yards and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and streets for example a project with 100 parking stalls and a 50% limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure 10minimum depth of landscaping adjacent to street rightofways this establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private property adjacent and in from the rightofway line thus if the required minimum depth is fifteen feet a project must landscape the first fifteen feet of its site back from the rightofway line all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards 11minimum buffer yard requirements this establishes the depth of a buffer yard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to primarily residential land uses in residential zoning districts all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards 12supplemental use regulations certain permitted uses require satisfaction of specific requirements in order to function successfully in their urban or rural contexts these supplemental

preserves agricultural uses including crop and animal production this district is intended to accommodate activities such as agriculture horticulture dairy farming livestock farming poultry farming general farming and other agricultural activities this district discourages low density single family residential development often associated with agricultural areas by requiring a minimum 10acre lot size the ag district is also intended to maintain interim agricultural uses within areas designated in the denison comprehensive plan as longterm urban growth areas the intent here is to discourage rural residential growth in these areas that are in watersheds that can eventually accommodate development served by extension of public sewers where these areas are outside the city limits of denison but within its twomile subdivision jurisdiction it is intended that the city work with the county to apply this districts site development regulations to these long term urban growth areas 2site

rural conservation development overlay district 1purpose the rc rural conservation development overlay district is intended to require development design standards and techniques in sensitive environmental areas around denison that preserve unique landforms and the character of land the techniques of the rc district require that the natural landforms determine the design and character of new residential development in these sensitive areas areas of environmental sensitivity and potential application of the rc overlay district may be established by the citys comprehensive development plan 2process subdivisions in an rc overlay district generally follow the approval procedures outlined in the citys subdivision establishing the process for preliminary and final plat approval projects which do not require subdivision follow approval procedures appropriate to the specific project including special use permits zoning amendments site plan review or other applicable measures the requirements and standards included in this section are in addition to those established procedures 3permitted land uses land uses permitted in an rc district are the same as those permitted in

areas comprise at least 35 percent of the net developable area and shall be designated and permanently protected full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local state and federal regulations so that their development potential is not reduced by this designation such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site secondary conservation areas are determined by specific project design and typically include all or some of the following kinds of resources aa 100foot deep greenway buffer along all waterbodies and watercourses and a 50foot greenway buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the medium intensity county soil survey of the usda natural resources conservation service these areas must be conserved as secondary conservation areas but are considered as developable areas for the purpose of calculating yield b100year floodplains cwoodlands individual specimen trees or small
