for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home to implement that thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in section 5 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew ordinance more and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain found constitutional in baker v borough of steelton 17 dauph 17 1912 a decision properly classified in thistlewood v trial magistrate for ocean city 236 md 548 204 a 2d 688 691 1964 as relating to a curfew ordinance of the remaining type e street is a way or place of whatsoever nature open to the use of the public as a

whether eastern standard time or eastern daylight time generally observed at that hour by the public in the town prima facie the time then observed in the thomaston town hall and police station g year of age continues from one birthday such as the seventeenth to but not including the day of the next such as the eighteenth birthday making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase under 18 years of age the latter phrase in practice unfortunately having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that 18 year olds might be involved similarly for example 11 or less years of age means under 12 years of age 4 curfew for minors it shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age under 18 to be or remain in or upon the streets within

writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station thus encouraging here as in other exceptional situations conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests g when authorized by special permit from the town manager carried on the person of the minor thus authorized as follows when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this ordinance then recourse may be had to the town manager either for a regulation as provided in subsection h or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the town managers finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted

with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously either to the town manager or if unavailable to the police officer authorized by the town manager to act on his behalf in an emergency at the police station h when authorized by regulation issued by the town manager in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to normal or necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis normally such regulation by the town manager on permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity media and agencies such as the school and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved but to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this

police and briefly identifying the minor the address of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment j when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle this contemplates normal travel from excess of caution this clearly exempts bona fide interstate  thomaston ordinances government & organization  movement particularly on normal routes such as route #1

provisions for notification are severable as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized  and additional also severable exceptions broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled

a birth certificate a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age a police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide inter alia that the policemen may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be

people of the town of thomaston to protect the environment to promote the development of an economically sound and stable community and to provide for the prevention control and abatement of public odor nuisance the town of thomaston finds and concludes that because most odorous pollutants have a complex chemical composition and may elict a broad spectrum of response by the receptors special methods must be employed in their measurement and characterization although analytical data are more precise and may be useful in identifying a source it is the human response or the sensory data that is most critical in determining the necessary degree of odor control analytical data may be used to specify permissible emission levels from a source but sensory date must be employed to assess the impact in the surrounding community the latter is the towns primary concern authority and administration 5021  authority this ordinance is adopted pursuant to title 30a ss2101 home rule  title 30a

installing and using a bypass meter is as follows 1 the bypass meter can be installed on any water line that does not discharge any portion of its flow to the public sewer 2 the owner must purchase and install the bypass meter a list of suppliers is shown below 3 the owner must notify the town office either in writing or by phone 3546107 that the meter is installed and ready to be used the ceo will then inspect and approve the installation 4 at the end of each calendar quarter the owner must submit the readings from the bypass meter to the town note the town will try to send a reminder to

existing wastewater facilities to accommodate and treat the increased wastewater flow directly produced and generated by this increased development these capital improvements have created a cost which is separate and distinct from normal maintenance and upgrading repairs which benefits existing users in order to assess these capital improvement costs for increasing capacity fairly and equitably among those creating this demand the town hereby established a sewer system development charge ssdc the proceeds from this charge are to be applied solely towards the overall capital costs of financing the necessary capital improvements and capital equipment purchases to increase the capacity of the wastewater facilities an aadc is the new or expanded municipal sewer users proportional cost of increasing the capacity of the wastewater collection pumping and treatment system which benefits the new or expanded user this charge is separate and distinct from the physical connection

following plan is established as provided by the sewer the town of thomaston introduction a significant portion of the total i & i reaching the wastewater treatment plant comes from the private portion of the collection system some of this is intentional such as sump pumps and some of it is unintentional such as groundwater leaking into building sewers for many years this private i & i was overlooked for two reasons first it was not believed by many people to be as large a portion of the problem as it is and second it was believed that little or nothing could be done about it today however both of these may have been dispelled thomastons sewer any source of unpolluted water from being connected to the sanitary sewer no sump pumps roof drains cellar drains foundation drains or any other unpolluted waters are permitted this is fairly easy to control with a new building however just as the town has to upgrade its public sewers so the private owners must look at their situation and assert that they are also in compliance with the sewer because a building has been connected to the sewer for many years does not exempt them from compliance this plan outlines a step by step program to bring as may sewer users as possible into full compliance with the sewer because a building has been connected to the sewer for many years does not exempt them from compliance this plan outlines a step by step program to bring as may sewer users as possible into full compliance with the sewer to try to do this by working with people and not against them 19901992 reconstruction

water in the design stage in the order shown below  if possible a new sanitary sewer and sanitary building sewer shall be provided so that the existing building sewer may remain as a storm drain this new sanitary building sewer should enter the basement several feet above the basement floor to prevent its use as a basement drain   or if the existing sewer cannot be converted to a storm drain then a new separate storm drain should also be installed to each building and connected to an existing storm sewer or ditch or natural watercourse thomaston ordinances sewer   in any event esigned

connected to th public sanitary sewer a written record of each inspection shall be made on a form such as shown in appendix e information on foundation drains should be gathered if possible but they cannot be removed until the town replaces the building sewer the ceo shall notify the owner of any structure found to be in violation of the sewer writing within 10 working days of the inspection the format shall be similar to the model in appendix e each situation shall be followed up until compliance with the sewer obtained new connection inspection each new structure before connecting to the public sewer must make out an application for sanitary sewer connection permit once this is approved and the building sewer is installed the line and the connection to the public sewer must be inspected by the ceo to record the inspection there is also space to note here that a check of the structure has been made to insure compliance with unpolluted water the back of this form is also used to make a sketch with ties of the location of the new house sewer should part of the plumbing not be complete at the time of inspection the ceo shall revisit the site at a later date to check for compliance with the sewer term monitoring in the spring of each year thereafter during the wettest time of the year a portion of the sanitary collection system should be inspected by tv cameras it is suggested that several thousand feet be televised each year this way the whole system could be looked at each five or six years this inspection is for two purposes first to ensure that the private property excess water removal plan is being adhered to and second to check the main sewer lines for leaks broken pipes and other problems because part of the reason for televising is to inspect the main sewer pipe itself it would make more sense to start this work on the sections of sewer not replaced in the capital improvement program thomaston ordinances sewer   since the major objective of this program is to remove excess water not charge people a surcharge for it a warning letter should be sent to anyone found to be in violation a suggested form is shown in letter f anyone who does not correct the problem in the allowed time however will have the added charge even if the problem is corrected immediately after the surcharge is added it must be paid for a full year if the problem is not corrected by the time of the next inspection the surcharge will continue for another year thomaston ordinances sewer   town of thomaston sewer monitoring program sanitary sewer operations plan
