establishing this chapter a the city council finds that there is a need for parking stalls and spaces to be located within the city which are made available to the public for charging of electric vehicles over shortterm or longterm periods in order to promote greater fuel conservation and enhance fuel and energy efficiency b the city council finds that the city has previously invested in electric vehicle charging infrastructure obtained by 511 contra costa the transportation demand management program for all jurisdictions within contra costa county with funding supplied c and measure j halfcent sales tax for transportation improvement projects along with transportation for clean air funding from the bay area air quality management district through such funding sources the city has constructed and installed various electric vehicle charging stations for the use of owners of electric vehicles to connect their electric vehicles to charging stations and charge their vehicle power sources c the city council finds that the public use of the cityowned electric vehicle charging stations has resulted in significant costs being incurred by the city including energy usage software program costs equipment depreciation personnel costs maintenance and repair and replacement costs  none of which may the city recover while it continues to provide such service without charging the vehicle owners fees for the benefits being received by them unreimbursed expenditures of money from the general fund and other resources shall continue to be incurred by the city each time a vehicle owner uses a cityowned vehicle charging station without payment of a fee to the city d the city council finds that it is beneficial to the public and the environment that the citys electric vehicle charging stations continue to be used and available to owners of electric vehicles and that the establishment of certain regulations including fees for the reimbursement of the city for its costs incurred in providing such service and hourly limits for parking in shortterm parking spaces will enable the city to continue to make available the electric vehicle charging service to the public on both shortterm and longterm charging basis e the city council finds that the fees being established in the amounts set forth by this reasonably proportionate to each users portion of costs incurred by the city in providing the service and further finds that based upon the anticipated level of usage such fees as a whole are reasonable and necessary for the city to recover even a portion of its costs

variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law providing that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing the procedures of of this ordinance have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to the elevation which the review authority believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the contra costa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency c consideration of variance 1 in passing upon requests for variances the review authority shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided the provisions of c1 c4 are satisfied and the structure or other development is protected by methods minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this chapter the review authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter cs   2 8192015 chapter 1532  woodburning
