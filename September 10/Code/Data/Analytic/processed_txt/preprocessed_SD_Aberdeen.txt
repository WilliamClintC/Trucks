therefore the city council does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss      statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within specific areas of the city by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize the expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions      methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article includes

to the wastewater collection and treatment system this document may contain the information specified in section 54210   c general provisions a purpose the federal pollution prevention act of 199 42 usc 13101 et seq declared that pollution prevention reduction and recycling become a national policy therefore this section sets forth requirements for the development and implementation of a pollution prevention program this program implemented in conjunction with the industrial pretreatment program will address pollution prevention using two means  pollution reduction at its source and the prevention of pollutant generation in addition this section will allow the inclusion of pollution prevention provisions in administrative or civil judicial enforcement actions regarding violations of pretreatment regulations or standards pursuant to this division the objectives of this subdivision are to 1 increase industrial user awareness of the opportunities to reduce or prevent pollution at its source effective changes in production operation and raw materials use 2 heighten the awareness of industry regarding source reduction existing regulations rely on compliance focus upon treatment and disposal of pollutants rather than source reduction existing regulations do not emphasize multimedia management of pollution 3 educate users that source reduction is fundamentally different and more desirable than waste management and pollution control b policy the city hereby declares it to be a policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible  pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible and disposal or other release into the environment shall be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner c applicability this section

regulations are promulgated which affect this division or the program implementation b program implementation the city will administer the pollution prevention program in conjunction with the industrial pretreatment program the program will encourage and where applicable mandate recycling reuse and reduction of pollutant discharges for appropriate users thus eliminating or reducing pollutant loads to the wastewater collection and treatment system without transferring the pollutants to another environmental media media transfer this will be accomplished by 1 incorporating pollution prevention questions into wastewater discharge permit applications 2 incorporating pollution prevention source reduction audits into the annual pretreatment program industrial user compliance inspections and allow the city to formally request from the user information regarding pollution prevention activities as well as other information necessary to implement this program from these audits the program will identify where appropriate measurable goals which will reflect an overall reduction in pollutant contributions in addition the audits will identify where appropriate

alternative production methods and hazardous waste minimization 4 recognizing positive approaches by users which reflect the intent of this article or similar state and federal legislation 5 updating the users wastewater discharge permits to incorporate pollution prevention requirements 6 where deemed necessary by the city requiring the user to develop a pollution prevention source reduction plan this plan would identify the technically feasible and economically practical source reduction and recycling measures the user intends to implement along with a timetable for making reasonable progress
