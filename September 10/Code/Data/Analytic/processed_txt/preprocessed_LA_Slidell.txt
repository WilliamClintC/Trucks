or period the following factors will be considered 1 scale scale is the relationship of the building and its elements including doors and windows to other structures in the district it is important when considering scale that a careful study be made of the height width and mass of buildings in the immediate neighborhood and district as a whole this study should serve to confirm or deny the appropriateness of the height width and mass of the proposed building maximum height of any new structure shall conform to the secretary of the interiors standards for the treatment of historic properties with guidelines for preserving rehabilitating restoring & reconstructing historic buildings in no case shall a new structure exceed a height allowed in the zoning district in which the building is located 2 siting siting is the positioning of a building on a lot this process includes determining the setback of a building the spacing of this building from adjacent buildings and the location of walls fences walks drives parking and landscaping if any of these are used in the overall design new construction should conform to setback landscape and parking requirements of the zoning

protection from flooding but also for constructing residences that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the character of the neighborhood and community the purpose of this section is to provide for welldesigned elevated residences for which there is a smooth transition from ground to dwelling with the foundation being integrated with or complementing the structure itself this may be accomplished with structural andor nonstructural improvements depending on the height of the base floor of the structure b requirements residences that are elevated above grade whether by columns posts piles piers pedestals or extended foundation walls shall enclose or substantially screen the structural members used to elevate the structure as well as other ancillary improvements eg areas used for parking of vehicles building access or storage the means for enclosing or screening the foundation ie the ground level beneath an elevated residence are specified in this section c design principles the most important consideration is to design an elevated foundation and its enclosure andor screening in a manner that resists the forces caused by the base flood and the character of its flood waters foundations and their enclosures andor screens that are built in these areas and under these flood conditions must be able to withstand the hydrostatic flood forces placed upon them resist the impact of waterborne debris and offer the minimum possible resistance to flow in order to reduce the dynamic forces without reducing the structural strength of the foundation d use of fill the use of fill for elevating residences shall be in accordance with division ii section 4 filling and fine grading of the standard subdivision specifications appendix b1 and section  fill e full enclosure of foundation area fully enclosed foundation areas shall be in accordance with section  standards and requirements f required openings walls that enclose the foundation area shall contain openings to allow for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters during design flood conditions these may be nonengineered or engineered openings which shall meet the requirements of section  standards

the floodplain with a finished floor of five feet or more above grade shall be recorded with the clerk of court with a stamped copy returned to the engineering department prior to the certificate of completionoccupancy being issued i means of enclosure the means of enclosing a foundation area may include structural andor nonstructural improvements as follows 1 structural enclosure improvements structural enclosure improvements include different types of wall systems that partially or fully enclose the foundation area walls used to form an enclosed foundation shall be designed so that they do not allow the pressure and velocity force of water and waterborne debris to load the structure excessively foundation systems shall be free of obstructions and attachments that will transfer flood forces to the structural system or that will restrict or eliminate free passage of flood waters during design flood conditions allowable structural improvements include a breakaway walls that are designed to break away or fail under flood loads but remain attached to the residence or are of a weight that are designed to sink and thus not create waterborne debris  b detached walls that may be temporarily removed from the permanent structure and stored before a flood  c hinged walls that are designed as hinged panels that may be swung out of the path of flood waters and debris  and d louvered walls that are designed to allow water to pass which are allowable only in locations or situations where no debris flow is expected 2 structural enclosure improvement design all groundlevel enclosures shall be designed to a allow flood waters to rise and flow freely under the structure  b not permit the enclosure walls themselves to become water borne debris  and c not cause the accumulation of waterborne debris 3 nonstructural screening improvements nonstructural screening improvements include finish materials attached or affixed to but not part of the foundation which may include but are not limited to siding veneer or lattice panel systems or other skirting materials landscaping may be used in addition to and not in place of nonstructural screening improvements unless

materials that exhibit woodlike properties metal concrete block poured concrete and unfinished wood are prohibited  and f landscaping adjacent to and within no more than 48 inches from the nonstructural screening improvement where the elevation is less than or equal to 30 inches from the mean ground level landscaping with a mature growth height of no less than 36 inches shall be planted in a continuous row along the elevations as set out in subsection k below see figure  standards for nonstructural screening improvements j design of structural and nonstructural enclosures structural
