records administration  policy the public records act currently codified at rcw requires public agencies to make identifiable nonexempt public records available for inspection and copying upon request and to publish rules of procedure to inform the public how access to public records will be accomplished flexibility to amend these rules of procedure is necessary to ensure the city is able to readily conform to frequent changes in the law therefore in accordance with the public records act and kcc the mayor is hereby authorized to establish and publish those policies and procedures that will apply within the city of kent to the submitting processing and responding to requests for public records under the public records act these rules of procedure should aim to provide fullest assistance to requestors and timely action on requests while also protecting public records from damage or disorganization and preventing excess interference with other essential city functions the current version of this policy shall be available to the public on the citys website     cost of providing public records in establishing the rules of procedure applicable to public records requests under kcc  the mayor is further authorized to establish and amend as necessary the fee schedule applicable to the costs of copying or otherwise providing public records to requesters to the fullest extent authorized by law   index of public records not maintained ain general the public records act requires all cities and public agencies maintain and make available a current index of certain public records however the public records act also provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome or would interfere with government operation a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome bfindings the city of kent is comprised of numerous departments and offices and each department or office consists of multiple subdivisions each individual subdivision performs a unique public service may utilize and produce multiple forms of writings as that term is defined in the public records act and may maintain and organize these writings in several formats and in varying filing systems thousands of writings are produced or utilized each day by these subdivisions and may include paper records computer files photographs audio recordings video recordings etc further complicating the ability to maintain a central index of records many subdivisions of the city are physically located at various places throughout the city as such it is unduly burdensome if not impossible and would detract from the purpose of providing essential services to the citizens of kent to maintain a current index of public records cdeclaration and order based upon the findings set forth in subsection b of this section the city council declares that it is unduly burdensome to maintain a central index of the records required by rcw  and as allowed by that statute formally orders that such an index not be maintained so long as all indexes that are maintained for city use are available for review and copying in conformity with applicable law    formerly   records subject to disclosure repealed by   form and manner of request for public records

roadways that are safe convenient and attractive for all users regardless of age and ability including pedestrians bicyclists transit riders freight haulers and motor vehicle drivers the vision of complete streets is a community in which all residents and visitors can safely and efficiently use the public rightofway to meet their transportation needs regardless of their preferred mode of travel     policy athe city will plan for design construct operate and maintain an appropriate and integrated transportation system that will meet the needs of pedestrians bicyclists wheelchair users transit riders freight haulers motorists emergency responders and residents of all ages and abilities btransportation system facilities that support the concept of complete streets shall include but are not limited to pavement markings and signs  street and sidewalk lighting  sidewalk and pedestrian safety improvements  americans with disabilities act ada and title vi compliance  street trees  transit accommodations  bicycle accommodations including signage and markings  and as appropriate streetscapes that appeal to and promote all modes of travel the systems design will be consistent with and supportive of local neighborhoods recognizing that transportation needs vary and must be balanced in a flexible safe and costeffective manner projects will therefore be assessed holistically to include the many considerations outlined above as well as the future need for conduit for cityowned fiber optics communications given the budgetary implications for provision of facilities     applicability the city will plan for design and construct all new city transportation improvement projects to provide appropriate and safe accommodation for pedestrians bicyclists transit riders freight haulers motor vehicles and persons of all abilities those city employees involved in the planning and design of projects within the public rightofway will give consideration to all users and modes of travel from the start of planning and design work consistent with approved plans and standards transportation system improvements shall be viewed as opportunities to create safer more accessible streets for all users and as opportunities to improve city communication processes between relevant personnel such as consulting city arborists on designs including street trees this shall apply to new construction reconstruction and rehabilitation the city may create a checklist that will assist in considering modes of travel in the planning and design of transportation system improvements adaspecific projects such as the installation of ramps or other improvements required for improved accessibility are exempt from complete streets consideration as are ordinary maintenance activities such as mowing sweeping spot repair joint sealing pothole filling and installation of raised pavement markers     plans and standards as city plans guidelines and standards are updated consideration shall be given to complete streets concepts to ensure that new regulations and practices comply with this chapter and the latest in applicable complete streets research and best

design guide and the federal highway administrations department of transportation manual on uniform traffic control devices     exemptions athe mayor after consultation with the public works director the economic and community development director and the parks and human services director may determine that a project is exempt from any or all of the requirements of this chapter based on the following circumstances 1the project would require the accommodation of street uses that are prohibited by law  2the accommodation of a specific use is expected to have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams wetlands or floodplains or on historic structures or sites eligible for listing in national state or local preservation registers above and beyond the impacts of currently existing infrastructure  3topographic challenges make accommodation of a specific use infeasible  4the establishment of complete streets facilities would be contrary to public safety  5the cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or probable future use  or 6the inclusion of complete streets facilities would create a disconnected section less than 300 feet of improvements where additional improvements at either end are unlikely to occur within 10 years bwhere the above exemptions allow complete streets facilities to be omitted from a roadway project the city shall consider whether bicyclists pedestrians transit users and persons of all abilities can be accommodated by nearby facilities and shall strive to provide complete streets connections to those facilities     intergovernmental cooperation the city will cooperate with other transportation agencies including the washington state department of transportation king county metro and sound transit to ensure the principles and practices of complete streets are embedded within their planning design construction and maintenance activities the city will specifically cooperate to ensure the

title this chapter shall be hereinafter known as the city of kent critical areas code     purpose and intent athe city of kent contains numerous areas that can be identified and characterized as critical such areas within the city include wetlands streams wildlife and fisheries habitat geologic hazard areas frequently flooded areas and critical aquifer recharge areas bthe city finds that these critical areas perform a variety of valuable and beneficial biological physical and economic functions that benefit the city and its residents alteration of certain critical areas may pose a threat to public safety private property and the environment the city finds therefore that identification regulation and protection of critical areas is necessary to protect the public health safety and general welfare the city further finds that the functions of critical areas and the purpose of these regulations include the following 1wetlands wetlands perform a variety of functions that include maintaining water quality  storing and conveying storm water and floodwater  recharging groundwater  providing important fish and wildlife habitat  and providing areas for recreation education scientific study and aesthetic appreciation wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates  reduce sediment chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants  provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures  provide habitat for wildlife  and protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion the primary goals of wetland regulation are to avoid wetland impacts  to achieve no net loss of wetland function and value  to provide levels of protection that reflect the sensitivity of individual wetlands and the intensity of proposed land uses  and to restore or enhance existing wetlands where possible the city of kents program for wetland protection is a combination of regulatory and nonregulatory programs designed to collectively provide for protection of wetland functions and values in a manner which is consistent with best available science and the other goals and objectives of the growth management act a rcw protection of the water quality and hydrologic functions of wetlands is accomplished in kent by a combination of storm water management controls including both water quality controls and flow controls regulated pursuant to chapters 602 707 and 714 kcc and wetland buffers imposed pursuant to this chapter taken together these programs will provide adequate water quality and hydrologic protection to meet best available science requirements 2fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas astreams and their associated riparian corridors provide important fish and wildlife habitat including habitat for threatened and endangered species  help maintain water quality  store and convey storm water and floodwater  recharge groundwater  and serve as areas for recreation education scientific study and aesthetic appreciation stream buffers serve to moderate storm water runoff volume and flow rates  reduce sediment chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants  provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures  provide habitat for wildlife  and protect stream resources from harmful intrusion the primary goals of stream regulation are to avoid or otherwise mitigate significant impacts to streams and associated riparian corridors  to protect threatened and endangered species  to protect water quality management techniques  and where possible to provide for stream enhancement and rehabilitation bwildlife habitat provides opportunities for food cover nesting breeding and movement for fish and wildlife within the city  maintains and promotes diversity of species and habitat within the city  integrates habitat protection with elements of the citys open space system  helps maintain air and water quality  helps control erosion  and serves as areas for recreation education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation the primary goals of wildlife habitat regulations are to identify and protect fish and wildlife habitat  to avoid impacts to critical habitats for fish and wildlife  to implement the goals of the endangered species act  to promote connectivity between habitat areas to allow for wildlife movement  to provide multipurpose open space corridors  and where possible to enhance and rehabilitate wildlife habitat 3geologic hazard areas geologic hazard areas include lands characterized by geologic hydrologic hydrogeologic topographic and vegetative conditions that render them susceptible to varying degrees of risk from landslides erosion or seismic or volcanic activity the primary goals of regulating geologic hazards are to avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property  to regulate land uses where necessary  and to conduct appropriate levels of analysis to ensure sound engineering and construction practices to address mitigate and potentially avoid identified hazards 4critical aquifer recharge areas aquifer recharge areas provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream dischargeflow during periods of low flow the city finds that certain locations are susceptible to contamination of water supplies by infiltration of pollutants to groundwater aquifers the primary goals of aquifer recharge regulations are to protect critical aquifer recharge areas and groundwater quality by avoiding or limiting land use activities that pose potential risk of aquifer contamination  and to minimize impacts to significant aquifer recharge areas application of performance standards 5frequently flooded areas floodplains and other areas subject to flooding perform important hydrologic functions and may present a risk to persons and property the primary goals of flood hazard regulations are to limit the effects of flooding on human health and safety and to protect public facilities and services the city of kents flood hazard regulations located in kcc regulate activities within frequently flooded areas in order to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in the city to the extent reasonably possible     regulated activities athis chapter shall apply to any regulated activity that may affect a critical area or a potential critical area or its buffer unless otherwise exempted by these regulations regulated activity that takes place within an area shown as a critical area on the critical areas inventory maps maintained by the department pursuant to kcc  raises a rebuttable presumption that the activity affects a potential critical area or its buffer this presumption may be overcome by information properly submitted by a qualified professional and confirmed by the department applicable activities include but are not limited to the following 1removing excavating disturbing or dredging soil sand gravel minerals organic matter or materials of any kind 2dumping discharging or filling with any material 3draining flooding or disturbing the water level or water table or diverting or impeding water flow 4driving pilings or placing obstructions 5constructing substantially reconstructing demolishing or altering the size of any structure or infrastructure 6destroying or altering vegetation grading harvesting shading or planting vegetation that would negatively affect the character of a critical area 7activities that result in significant changes in water temperature or physical or chemical characteristics of water sources including quantity and pollutants 8any other activity potentially affecting a critical area or buffer not otherwise exempt from the provisions of this chapter as determined by the department 9the construction of new recreation trails within the buffer where a regulated activity would be partly within and partly outside a critical area or its buffer the entire activity shall be reviewed pursuant to the requirements of this chapter bto avoid duplication all permits and approvals identified in kcc shall be subject to and coordinated with the requirements of this chapter cnonproject actions including but not limited to rezones comprehensive plan map amendments annexations and the adoption of plans and programs shall be subject to this chapter however the department may at its discretion permit any studies or evaluations required by this chapter to use methodologies and provide a level of detail appropriate to the action proposed dactivities within the green river natural resources area shall be

wetland reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles bthe goal of rehabilitation is repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain 2establishment creation of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species establishment results in a gain in wetland acres this should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design aif a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland or buffer impacts the approval authority may authorize creation of a wetland and buffer upon demonstration by the applicants qualified wetland scientist that ithe hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere  iithe proposed mitigation site does not contain invasive plants or noxious weeds or that such vegetation will be completely eradicated at the site  iiiadjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland and buffer eg due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds stormwater runoff noise light or other impacts  and ivthe proposed wetland and buffer are designed to be selfsustaining with little or no longterm maintenance 3enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the altered area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement flood water retention or wildlife habitat enhancement alone will result in a loss of wetland acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions lost applicants proposing to enhance wetlands or associated buffers shall demonstrate ahow the proposed enhancement will increase the wetlands or the buffers functions  bhow this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts  and chow all other existing wetland functions at the mitigation site will be protected dacreage replacement and enhancement ratio wetland alterations shall be replaced or enhanced using the formulas in the table below  however the director may choose to double mitigation ratios in instances where wetlands are filled or negatively affected as a result of code violations the first number specifies the acreage of wetlands requiring replacement and the second specifies the acreage

implementation of inkind compensation impracticable 3outofkind replacement will best meet identified regional goals eg replacement of historically diminished wetland types iadvance mitigation mitigation for projects with preidentified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules state policy on advance mitigation and state water quality regulations jlocation compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted onsite or within the same subbasin as the impact site unless the applicant can demonstrate that 1the hydrology and ecosystem of the original wetland and those who benefit from the hydrology and ecosystem will not be substantially damaged by the onsite loss 2 onsite compensation is not feasible due to problems with hydrology soils or other factors 3compensation is not practical due to potentially adverse impacts from surrounding land uses 4existing functional values at the site of

hearing mitigation mobility management zones and standards  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to set forth specific standards providing for city compliance with the concurrency requirements of the state growth management act gma and for consistency between city and countywide planning policies under the gma the gma requires that adequate street capacity is provided concurrently with development to handle the increased traffic projected to result from growth and development in the city and region the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the citys transportation system shall be adequate to serve the future development at the time the development is available for occupancy hereinafter referred to as concurrency without decreasing current service levels below established minimum standards the intent of this chapter is to establish a transportation concurrency management system tcms to ensure that the necessary facilities andor programs needed to maintain a minimum level of service can be provided simultaneous to or within a reasonable time of new development as required in the gma the gma requires that a specific set of standards be developed to measure and

2transportation demand management as a mitigation measure the project proponent may establish transportation demand management tdm strategies to reduce single occupant vehicle trips generated by the project the project proponent shall document the specific measures to be implemented and the number of trips to be reduced by each measure the tdm program may be denied based on the criteria of subsection b3 of this section the director must approve the strategies and shall monitor and enforce the performance of agreed upon tdm measures the director will determine if performance measuring devices shall be imposed and may require annual documentation of the continued effectiveness of such measures the director may require that additional measures be implemented if the agreed upon measures fail to result in the reduction of the stated number of trips 3decision criteriaacceptable mitigation acceptable mitigation requires a finding by the director that athe mitigation is consistent with the comprehensive plan bthe mitigation contributes to system performance cimprovements to an intersection or roadway may not shift traffic to a residential area dimprovements to an intersection or roadway may not shift traffic to other intersections for which there is no acceptable mitigation available eimprovements to an intersection or roadway may not shift traffic to intersections within another jurisdiction which would violate that jurisdictions policies and regulations fimprovements to an intersection or roadway may not shift traffic to another mobility management zone and violate that zones objectives and standards gthe effect of the improvement would not result in a reduction or the loss of another transportation objective including but not limited to maintaining high occupancy vehicle lanes sidewalks or bicycle lanes hthe adverse environmental impacts of the facilities improvement can be reasonably alleviated ithe improvement will not violate accepted engineering standards and practices notwithstanding the foregoing the director has the authority in the directors sole discretion to require correction of a documented safetyrelated deficiency cmitigation denialappeal process if the director determines that the proposed mitigation does not meet the requirements of this chapter the director may deny the proposed improvements and

code  short title this title shall be known and cited as the zoning city of kent  purpose of zoning code ain adopting this title the city recognizes that there is a continuing need to regulate the use of land to promote the public health safety and general welfare the city recognizes the opportunities to obtain an urban environment of high quality without unduly high public or private expenditures for development and without unreasonably restricting private enterprise or initiative bthe city further recognizes that since the general welfare of the public is superior in importance to the pecuniary profits of the individual this title may 1 limit the use of property 2 cause depreciation of property values or 3 prevent the most profitable use of land zoning does not therefore constitute a vested right also if some reasonable use of the property is allowed by this title the effect is not confiscatory and is a proper exercise of the police power cthis title in order to obtain the greatest benefits from the opportunities which exist in the city has been prepared in accordance with the following principles 1this title is based on the city comprehensive plan with respect to the general pattern of future land uses and the principles of future land development expressed in such plan 2this title recognizes the importance to the community of all legitimate uses of land this title further recognizes the need of all such uses to be protected from other uses which are unrelated or incompatible thus each district is exclusive with respect to every other zoning district established in this title and industrial zoning districts are protected from encroachment by residential uses as firmly as residential districts are protected from industrial encroachment 3development standards are based on the best accepted contemporary practice rather than on past practices contemporary practice recognizes the need for more flexible regulation than in the past with more administrative discretion concerning land development decisions review of development plans is required in many districts to obtain welldesigned and properly integrated developments 4uses which would adversely affect adjoining uses or the public welfare unless regulated in a particular way and meeting established standards and criteria may be allowed as conditional uses subject to review by the

conditional uses apurpose it is the purpose of this section to identify certain types of land uses that usually require relatively greater freedom of location than other uses restricted to certain districts by this title general conditional uses may be allowed in the various zoning districts following the procedures in this section general conditional uses may have one 1 or all of the following characteristics 1public necessity requires such use in all or several districts 2their technical operating or service characteristics are such as to make it impractical to restrict their location only to certain districts 3although they fit the description in subsections 1 and 2 of this section their impact or effect on the immediate neighborhood or vicinity in which they are located may be detrimental in the absence of adequate performance standards development controls or good site planning it is therefore the purpose of this section to reconcile potential conflicts between public necessity of certain uses and their possible detrimental effects on other uses btypes of uses identified the uses identified for the purpose of this section will generally fall into several broad categories as follows 1utility transportation and communication facilities includes electrical substations pumping or regulating devices for the transmission of water including public water treatment facilities gas steam petroleum etc bus stops transit stations etc 2public facilities includes firehouses police stations libraries and administrative offices of governmental agencies 3open space uses

revised 520 apurpose and goals the purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities wtfs specifically including without limitation towers and antennas in light of the following goals 1protecting residential areas from potential adverse impacts  2enhancing the ability of the providers of wireless telecommunications services to provide those services quickly effectively and efficiently  3encouraging location in nonresidential areas  4minimizing the total height of towers within the community  5encouraging the joint use of new and existing sites  6encouraging service providers to locate and configure facilities to minimize adverse impacts design siting landscaping screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  and 7considering potential adverse impacts to the public health and safety from these facilities except where preempted by other laws rules and regulations in furtherance of these goals the city shall give due consideration to the citys comprehensive plan zoning map existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of wtfs including towers and antennas bdefinitions as used in this section only the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below abandon or abandonment means 1to cease operation for a period of 180 or more consecutive calendar days  or 2to reduce the effective radiated power of an antenna by 75 percent for 180 or more consecutive calendar days unless new technology or the construction of additional cells in the same
