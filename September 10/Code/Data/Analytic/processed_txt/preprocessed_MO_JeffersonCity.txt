highest quality of development services infrastructure and quality of life for its citizens one of the primary keys for achieving these goals is to enhance and expand the local economy competition for attracting new businesses and employers as well as retaining the ones already in existence in the community can be aggressive from time to time at national regional interstate and intrastate levels for this reason the city recognizes that the appropriate use of economic development incentives may be necessary in the correct circumstances to aid the city in reaching its full economic potential the purpose of these policies are twofold first to establish the goals standards guidelines and preferences of the city to direct the use of economic incentives to ensure that these incentives are used in a way that advances the citys economic goals these policies allow the city to be proactive not reactive with respect to requests from developers and businesses to create the publicprivate partnerships which are the real result of granting incentives in any instance these policies serve as a guide to developers and businesses far and wide to attract those having concepts ideas and plans that closely match the development needs of the city conversely these policies also inform the development and business community that incentives for businesses already supported in the city or for which there is no longer a community need may be more difficult to obtain second the procedures component establishes a uniform transparent and wellinformed path for businesses and developers to follow when seeking economic development incentives of the city we believe that standard approach the expectations of applicants can be managed at reasonable levels which leads to a more positive experience for those seeking incentives the uniform application of these procedures ensures that the goals and needs of the city are being specifically considered for each economic development incentives request which leads to greater longterm success of the program as a whole finally these procedures address the ongoing execution of each approved incentive application thereby confirming that the applicant will be held accountable for delivering the promised investment in the community which in turn builds confidence in the citys incentives program by its citizens and the other affected taxing jurisdictions that are the citys neighbors nevertheless the applicability of the differing incentives programs often varies from project to project and the city councils decision to grant incentives is discretionary based upon one or more of the criteria set forth in this document and other outside factors the city council is under no obligation to approve any requested incentives that are not required by state or local laws and it reserves the right to deviate from these policies and procedures at its sole discretion when doing so is deemed to be in the best

statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of missouri has in rsmo  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city council of the city of jefferson city missouri ordains as follows 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of jefferson city missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for cole county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in subsection 31301a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d by applying the provisions of this article to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  and 2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations secs 3130331309  reserved administration a

protect the health safety and general welfare of the public while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the city of jefferson specifically this section is intended to 1 provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the city of jefferson  2 minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennas and support structures careful design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  3 maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities  4 maximize the colocation of facilities on any new support structures and facilitate the fewest and least visible new support structures capable of achieving these objectives  5 ensure that any new telecommunications tower or support structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible  and 6 ensure that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service b applicability 1 all towers antenna support structures and telecommunications facilities any portion of which are located within the city of jefferson are subject to this section all towers within the city of jefferson missouri at the time of passage of this section shall be registered with the director within 60 days from the effective date hereof together with the height width and location thereof and a registration fee of $5000 failure to register an existing tower shall raise a presumption that said tower was not a legal nonconforming use on the date of passage of this section however this section shall not apply to tower structures used or to be used solely for services provided pursuant to a broadcast radio or television license issued by the federal communications commission or to towers and antennas used solely for private telecommunications services when the equipment is located on the premises of the entity using said private telecommunication service or the towers and antennas support structure or masts are located

and additionally pursuant to its general and specific police powers established by statute authorizing the regulations herein to protect the public health safety and welfare 4 the federal communications commission fcc has exclusive jurisdiction over 1 the regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions from telecommunications facilities and 2 the regulation of radio signal interference among users of the radio frequency spectrum 5 consistent with the telecommunications act of 199 the regulations of this section will not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and do not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service the regulations also impose reasonable restrictions to protect the public safety and welfare and ensure opportunities for placement of antennas with prompt approval by the city this section does not attempt to regulate in areas within the exclusive jurisdiction of

floor area d multiple uses within the building when more than one type of use that has a parking requirement is located within the building and at least 20 percent of the gross floor area is devoted to that use the parking needs for that use shall be calculated separately from the other uses for example a 20000 square foot building with 5000 square feet of office space and 15000 square feet of warehouse space would require 17 parking spaces for the office and 15 parking spaces for the warehouse space for a total of 32 parking spaces e shared parking facilities offstreet parking requirements of a given use may be met with offsite or offstreet parking facilities of another use when and if all of the following conditions are met 1 the location shall comply with the provisions of subsection 3558b4  2 the parking demands of the individual uses as determined by the director based upon parking demand information supplied by the applicant or other sources are such that the total parking

director recorded and a copy maintained in the project file should the lease expire or otherwise terminate the use for which the offsite parking was provided shall be considered a violation any and all approvals including special exception use or conditional use permits shall be subject to revocation continuation or expansion of the use shall be prohibited unless the use is brought into compliance with the parking regulations of this ordinance f temporary use of unpaved parking facilities the use of an unpaved offstreet parking lot may be authorized for a maximum of six months provided the location construction and design of same shall be first approved by the director 2 exceptions to required number of spaces a reduced parking for uses near municipal parking lots where there is a municipal parking lot within 500 feet the parking spaces required for nonresidential uses and mixed uses may be reduced by ten percent of the total spaces in the municipal lot or lots where ten percent of the municipal spaces are equal to or exceed the spaces required for the use the parking requirements are satisfied b reduced parking for uses with adjacent onstreet parking 1 where onstreet parking exists on a street adjacent to a new or expanded use located within the old town district as defined in chapter 25 the required number of off street parking spaces for the new or expanded use may be reduced by one space for each 25 feet of frontage on the street with a maximum reduction for a single parcel as follows a for singlefamily and multifamily residential uses one space per unit up to a maximum reduction for a single parcel of five spaces b for nonresidential uses a maximum reduction of five spaces for a single parcel where the five space reduction is equal to or exceeds the spaces required for the use the parking requirements are satisfied 2 reduction of required parking granted by this subsection shall not grant exclusive use or ownership of adjacent onstreet parking spaces nor shall prevent the city from eliminating or otherwise modifying onstreet parking c reduced onsite parking with parking management plan the director may reduce the number of required parking spaces up to 25 percent when the applicant provides a parking management plan the parking management plan shall include transportation alternatives such as sharedride programs carpooling and vanpooling programs transit and commuter use shared parking and other offsite parking that reduce the need for parking spaces prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval of a business license the applicant shall provide evidence that such parking management plans exist the evidence must include copies of any contracts lease agreements purchase agreements and other documentation showing that such transportation alternatives have occurred or are about to occur the evidence shall report the number of participants involved the percentage of the maximum work

content and form of which shall be approved by the director which binds all successors in title to the commitments approved and the applicant shall include a clause in all leases which binds all tenants to this commitment made by the applicant no change in the approved plans shall take place without a review by the director approval of the parking management plan does not relieve the applicant of an ongoing requirement to provide offstreet parking spaces if demand increases d variance in parking requirements the director shall have the authority to vary the parking requirement by up to 20 percent of the required parking if one or more of the following circumstances exists 1 expected automobile ownership or use patterns of employees tenants or other users varies from what is typical in the community or typical for the use 2 the parking demand varies throughout the day in relation to parking supply 3 the nature of operational aspects of the use warrants unique parking arrangements 4 actual parking practice in the community demonstrates that the parking standard may be too high 3 parking in c3 central commercial district large office buildings structured parking rather than surface parking shall be required for office buildings or other uses in the c3 district that exceed 75000 square feet for office use 4 location a the parking area shall be provided on the same parcel as the principal use or structure wherever practicable b offsite parking for nonresidential uses shall be located within 450 feet of the site on land which is zoned for parking lot use as

recommendations article vi  nonconforming uses or situations purpose it is the purpose of this article to provide for the regulation of uses buildings structures or lots which legally existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance but which fail to comply with one or more of the applicable regulations or standards established by this ordinance or subsequent amendment of this ordinance or which have been rendered nonconforming due to circumstances which were not selfcreated this ordinance recognizes that nonconforming uses or situations that are otherwise lawful have a vested property right so long as they remain lawful otherwise it is the intent of these regulations to specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue and expand applicability a these regulations apply to nonconforming uses or situations which were originally allowed and have been maintained over time these uses or situations have legal nonconforming status and may continue so long as they are legal otherwise land uses or situations that were not permitted when they were established and have been maintained over time have no legal right to continue and shall be terminated unless granted legal nonconforming status by the procedure outlined in section 3563 b in certain cases nonconformities may be permitted to be upgraded when it can be shown that such action will not be harmful and will be beneficial to the surrounding properties the neighborhood or the community  and that the goals of the comprehensive plan and other local plans will not be impeded by the continuation of the nonconformity nonconforming uses or situations that have a lesser impact on the immediate area have fewer restrictions than those with greater impacts for instance nonconforming uses in residential zones pose greater impacts and the expansion of such are regulated more strictly to ensure the protection of continuing residential neighborhood livability and character in contrast expansion of nonconforming residential developments in residential zones are treated more liberally because they do not represent a major disruption to the neighborhood and they provide needed housing opportunities determination of legal nonconforming status review a purpose review and determination this section provides information on how legal
