causes flooding or erosion on adjacent properties runoff shall be properly channeled into a storm drain watercourse pond area or other public facility soil erosion and sedimentation control  soil erosion and sedimentation control general standards 1 all development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by the topography and soil as to create the least potential for soil erosion 2 slopes over eighteen percent in grade shall not be developed 3 development on slopes with a grade between twelve and eighteen percent shall be carefully reviewed to insure adequate measures have been taken to prevent erosion sedimentation and structural damage 4 the construction site shall be permanently vegetated within twelve 12 months after the construction begins  soil erosion and sedimentation control exposed slopes 1 the following control measures should be taken to control erosion during construction 2 no exposed slope should be steeper in grade than five 5 feet horizontal to one 1 foot vertical 3 exposed slopes steeper in grade than ten 10 feet horizontal to one 1 foot vertical should be contour plowed to minimize direct runoff of water 4 at the foot of each exposed slope a channel and berm should be constructed to control runoff the channeled water should be diverted to a sedimentation basin debris basin silt basin or silt trap before being allowed to enter the natural drainage system 5 along the top of each exposed slope a berm should be constructed to prevent runoff from flowing over the edge of the slope where runoff collecting behind said berm cannot be diverted elsewhere and must be directed down the berm appropriate measures should be taken to prevent erosion such measures should consist of either an asphalt paved flow apron and drop chute laid down the slope or a flexible slope drain at the base of the slope drain flow apron a gravel energy dissipater should be installed to prevent erosion at the discharge end 6 exposed slopes should be protected by whatever means will effectively prevent erosion considering the degree of slope soil material and expected length of exposure slope protection shall consist of mulch sheets of plastic burlap or jute netting sod blankets fastgrowing grasses or temporary seeding of annual grasses mulch consists of hay straw wood chips corn stalks bark or other protective material mulch should be anchored to slopes with a liquid asphalt stakes and netting or should be worked into the soil to provide additional slope stability 7 control measures other than those specifically stated above may be used in place of the above measures if it can be demonstrated that they will as effectively protect exposed slopes preservation of natural drainageways  soil erosion and sedimentation control waterways 1 the use of storm sewers for runoff control is not an acceptable alternative to the use of a natural aboveground drainage system storm sewers may only be used where it can be demonstrated that the use of the aboveground natural drainage system will inadequately dispose of runoff aboveground runoff disposal waterways may be constructed to augment the natural drainage system 2 the widths of a constructed waterway shall be sufficiently large to adequately channel runoff from a ten 10 year storm adequacy shall be determined by the expected runoff when full development of the drainage area 1s reached 3 no fences or structures shall be constructed across the waterway that will reduce or restrict the flow of water 4 the banks of the waterway shall be protected with permanent turf vegetation 5 the banks of the waterways should not exceed five 5 feet horizontal to one 1 foot vertical in gradient 6 the gradient of the waterway bed should not exceed a grade that will result in a velocity that will cause erosion of the banks of the waterway 7 the bed of the waterway should be protected with turf sod or concrete if turf sod will not function properly riprap may be used riprap shall consist of quarried limestone fieldstone if random riprap is used or construction materials provided said construction materials are limited to asphalt cement and concrete the riprap shall be no smaller than two 2 feet square construction materials shall be used only in those areas where the waterway is not used as part of a recreation trail system 8 if the flow velocity in the waterway is such that erosion of the turf sidewall will occur and said velocity cannot be decreased via velocity control structures then other materials may replace turf on the sidewall either gravel or riprap would be allowed to prevent erosion at these points  soil erosion and sedimentation control waterway velocity 1 the flow velocity of runoff in waterways shall be controlled to a velocity that will not cause erosion of the waterway 2 flow velocity should be controlled installation of diversions berms slope drains and other similarly effective velocity control structures  soil erosion and sedimentation control sediment control 1 to prevent sedimentation of waterways pervious and impervious sediment traps and other sediment control structures shall be incorporated throughout the contributing watershed 2 temporary pervious sediment traps could consist of a construction of bales of hay with a low spillway embankment section of sand and gravel that permits a slow movement of water while filtering sediment such structures would serve as temporary sediment control features during the construction state of development development of housing or other structures shall be restricted from the area on either side of the waterway required to channel a twentyfive25 year storm 3 permanent impervious sediment control structures consist of sediment basins debris basins desilting basins or silt traps and shall be utilized to remove sediment from runoff prior to its disposal in any permanent body of water  soil erosion and sedimentation control maintenance of erosion control system 1 the erosion and velocity control structures shall be maintained in a condition that will insure continuous functioning according to the provisions of this sediment basins shall be maintained as the need occurs to insure continuous desilting action 3 the areas utilized for runoff waterways and sediment basins shall not be allowed to exist in an unsightly condition the banks of the sediment basins and waterways shall be landscaped 4 prior to the approval of any plat for development the developer shall make provision for continued maintenance on the erosion and sediment control system tree and woodland regulations 1 the following regulation shall apply to all residential development occurring in wooded areas structures shall be located in such a manner that the maximum number of trees shall be preserved prior to the granting of a building permit it shall be the duty of the person seeking the permit to demonstrate that there are no feasible or prudent alternatives to the cutting of trees on the site and that if trees are cut proper reforestation will occur upon or before completion of the development 2 forestation reforestation or landscaping shall utilize a variety of tree species and shall not utilize any species presently under disease epidemic species planted shall be hardy under local conditions and compatible with the local landscape 3 grading and contouring shall take place in such a manner that the root zone aeration and stability of existing trees shall not be affected and shall provide existing trees with a watering area equal to onehalf of the crown area development in woodlands shall not reduce the existing crown cover greater than fiftypercent and shall be conducted in such a manner that the forest understory is preserved 4 notwithstanding the above the removal of trees seriously damaged by storms or other acts of god or diseased trees shall not he prohibited  tree and woodland regulations landscaping except as otherwise specifically provided in this no trees shall be planted between any lot line which abuts an agricultural field and the pertinent setback distance listed below district setback limit
