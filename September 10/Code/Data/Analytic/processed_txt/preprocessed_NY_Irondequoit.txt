code  515  b exceptions to competitive bidding requirements the following is a description of the various exceptions to the requirements of general municipal law  103 1 preferred sources under state finance law  162 as amended or changed all suitable products and services as determined and approved by the new york state office of general services shall be procured by any political subdivision in accordance with applicable specifications of the political subdivision from qualified charitable nonprofit agencies for the blind qualified nonprofit agencies for other severely handicapped qualified special employment programs for the mentally ill or veterans workshops which have been approved by the commissioner of social services education or mental health as the case may be and which are organized under the laws of new york state and are manufacturing such products or performing such services within the state whenever the products are available at a price determined by the office of general services competitive bidding requirements are not applicable to these purchases 2 goods made in correctional institutions a under correction law  184 as amended or changed the commissioner of correctional services is required to cause to be manufactured by inmates in state correctional institutions items as are required by the state and political subdivisions and to furnish these items at prices as shall be fixed and determined upon requisition that section provides no article so manufactured    shall be purchased from any other source    unless the commissioner    shall certify that the same cannot be furnished upon such requisition and no claim therefor shall be audited or paid without such certificate see also correction law  186 as amended or changed b since the legislature has provided a purchasing requirement for articles manufactured in correctional institutions which is contrary to  103 of the general municipal law as amended or changed said section has no application to such purchases under the correction law a town may apply to the department of correctional services for a waiver which would allow the town to make the purchase from other sources pursuant to normal competitive bidding requirements in addition a town may appeal the purchase price on the basis that it unreasonably exceeds fair market price correction law  186 as amended or changed for further information on this program political subdivisions may contact the department of correctional services division of correctional industries 3 state contracts pursuant to general municipal law  104 as amended or changed political subdivisions and districts therein are authorized to make purchases in excess of $500 of materials  515 police department  515  equipment and supplies except printed material new york state office of general services ogs subject to rules established by ogs see state finance law  163 of the general municipal law provides that purchases by the town are excepted from competitive bidding requirements a town may purchase numerous items at the same prices and under the same terms and conditions as the state under  104 of the general municipal law all purchases are subject to audit and inspection by the political subdivision and the political subdivision must accept sole responsibility for payment to the vendor no official may make a purchase ogs when bids have already been received unless the purchase may be made upon the same terms conditions and specifications but at a lower price 4 county city and town contracts pursuant to general municipal law  103 subdivisions 3 and 16 as amended or changed purchases county city or town in new york state are exempted from the competitive bidding requirements of general municipal law  103 as amended or changed as with purchases all purchases are subject to audit and inspection by the town and the town must accept sole responsibility for payment to the vendor no local official may make a purchase county city or town when bids have already been received unless the purchase may be made upon the same terms conditions and specifications but at a lower price county city or town 5 limitations on state county city and town contracts a the exception for state county city or town contract purchases applies only when purchases are made from the current state county city or town vendor or in certain cases a listed agent or distributor whose contract has been extended to political subdivisions thus the town may not as an exception to bidding requirements purchase from a vendor other than a vendor holding a current state county city or town contract that has been extended to political subdivisions even if the purchase is equal to or below the state or county price for example if a quote or bid were less than the state or county contract price the town cannot simply accept that lower price without going normal bid or quotation process b purchases from vendors holding state county city or town contracts may not be made upon terms and conditions which materially or substantially vary from the state county city or town contract also these exceptions relate to both purchase contracts and contracts for public work  515 irondequoit code  515  c notwithstanding anything contrary under general municipal law  10316 the exception from public bidding shall apply only to new york state contracts and contracts let by towns cities and counties in new york state 6 true leases a the courts have held that true lease agreements are neither purchases nor contracts for public work and thus are not subject to bidding under general municipal law  103 as amended or changed competitive bidding requirements may not be avoided by simply casting an agreement which is truly a purchase or contract for public work as a lease or rental b although no one factor is determinative the following factors are to be considered when determining whether an agreement is a true lease or an installment purchase contract  transaction is a device intended to circumvent the competitive bidding statutes   intent to transfer title to town present or not   town assumes indicia of ownership ie risk of loss maintenance repairs insurance   principle and interest component present in payment   useful life of property involved   acquisition of equity by town during term of this agreement   fair market rental value   value of option to purchase at end of the agreement  and or  total cost of payments in comparison to fair market value of property at inception of contract 7 insurance the courts have held that insurance coverage is not subject to formal competitive bidding 8 emergencies a an exception to the competitive bidding requirements exists for emergency situations general municipal law  103 subdivision 4 as amended or changed the following are three basic statutory criteria to be met in order to fall within this exception  the situation arises out of an accident or other unforeseen occurrence or condition  515 police department  515   the circumstances affect public buildings public property or the life health safety or property of the towns residents  the situation requires immediate action which cannot await competitive bidding b generally there must be a present immediate and existing condition which is creating an imminent threat or danger and which requires such immediate action that a further delay to comply with competitive bidding requirements would be so detrimental to the public interest that it overcomes the strong public policy in favor of bidding because the emergency must result from an accident or unforeseen occurrence it is doubtful the town may invoke the emergency exception in a situation which is the result of inaction or dilatory behavior on the part of local officials and which therefore could have been foreseen in time to advertise for bids even when the town board passes a resolution that a public emergency exists the public interest dictates that purchases are made at the lowest possible costs seeking competition by informal solicitation of quotes or otherwise to the extent practicable under the circumstances 9 sole source a competitive bidding is not required under  103 of the general municipal law as amended or changed in those limited situations when a town in the public interest requires particular goods or services which uniquely serve the public interest for which there is no substantial equivalent and which are in fact available from only one good source see gen 1986 opns st comp no 8625 p 41 thus for example if the town acting in good faith and without intent to arbitrarily inhibit or restrict competition determines that a particular patented item is required in the public interest and it is further determined that such item is available only from one source so that no possibility of competition exists competitive bidding may not be required for the procurement of the item b in making these determinations the town should document among other things the unique benefits of the item as compared to other items available in the marketplace that no other item provides substantially equivalent or similar benefits  and that considering the benefits received the cost of the item is reasonable when compared to other products or services in the marketplace in addition the town should document that as matter of fact there is no possibility of competition for the procurement 10 professional services  515 irondequoit code  515   516 determination of procedure  documentation whether a procurement is subject to competitive bidding a the courts have held that professional services are not contracts for public work as that phrase is used in the bidding statutes and therefore are not subject to competitive bidding procedures the determination of whether the professional service exception is applicable in given situations must be made on a casebycase basis examining the particular services to be acquired b generally professional services involve specialized expertise use of professional judgment andor a high degree of creativity also the services generally are to be performed by particular designated individuals finally the courts have noted that professional service contracts often involve a relationship of personal trust and confidence among the services which have been held to be exempt from competitive bidding under this exception are those of an engineer architect land surveyor attorney physician and insurance broker c generally if the situation warrants a solicitation of costs an effective method would be a request for proposal rfp the extent of the rfp would be decided on a casebycase basis 11 secondhand equipment from other governments there is a statutory exception to competitive bidding requirements which permits the purchases of surplus and secondhand supplies materials or equipment without competitive bidding from the federal or state government or from any other political or public benefit corporation within the state general municipal law  103 subdivision 6 however purchases of used items from any other source eg private sources like auctions or goingoutofbusiness sales are not exempt from bidding requirements a analysis of proposed procurements there must be a determination as to whether a proposed procurement is subject to competitive bidding and if not documenting how the decision is reached three initial questions must be addressed is the proposed procurement a purchase contract or a contract for public work if it is either is the amount above the applicable threshold in  103 of the general municipal law as amended or changed if so do any exceptions apply if it is not what type of procurement is it b in general purchase contracts involve the acquisition of commodities materials supplies or equipment while contracts for public work involve services labor or construction each procurement must be reviewed on a casebycase basis to determine which kind of purchase it would be if it would involve a substantial amount of service to the extent that the service provided to the town is the focal point and the acquisition of goods is incidental then it would be considered a  515 police department  516   517 documentation required for purchase orders and contract awards for nonbid procurements contract for public work conversely if the service or labor is only minimal or incidental to the acquisition of goods it would be considered a purchase contract c for example a contract for interior painting of a building involves both material paint and labor painting in most instances the labor component of the contract will be predominant making it a contract for public work in contrast replacing a boiler furnace while involving both equipment the boiler and labor will in most instances consist primarily of a charge for the equipment making it a purchase contract d in documenting whether a proposed procurement is below the bidding limits records should include evidence of a written or verbal quotes telephone logs etc to substantiate that the price of the item or service would not exceed the bidding limits in addition since similar procurements to be made in a fiscal year must be considered in the aggregate for purposes of determining whether a particular item must be bid the responsible individual could document the amount expended in previous years and that the monetary thresholds are not anticipated to be exceeded in the current year and therefore bidding would not be required in this process the amount anticipated to be spent in the current year should be documented because the amount involved may affect the method of competition to be sought documentation should also explain how it was determined that the procurement was either a purchase or a public works contract a verbal quotations a telephone log or other record should provide at a minimum the date the item or service desired the price quoted and the name of the vendors representative b written quotations vendors should provide at a minimum the date a description of the item or details of the service to be provided the price quoted name of contract and signature quotes from websites are also acceptable provided that the relevant webpages are printed and kept in town files similar to written quotes provided by other vendors c procurements subject to  104b of the general municipal law are listed in the following chart with policies and procedures dollar limits 1 or more verbal quotes 3 or more verbal quotes written quotes 3 or more purchase contracts below $20000 under $500 x $500  $999 x  516 irondequoit code  517   518 documentation of particular nonbid procurements dollar limits 1 or more verbal quotes 3 or more verbal quotes written quotes 3 or more $1000  $19999 x contract for public work below $35000 under $1000 x $1000  $4999 x $5000  $34999 x d price documentation copies of the verbal quotation record or the written quotation with the above information must be attached to each purchase order as it is processed for ordering purchase orders without this information will be returned to the ordering department a sample of the town of irondequoit quotation log is attached13 a in each of these situations the following documentation should be maintained to show that the procurement is in the best interest of the local government and how that determination was made following are suggested acceptable methods of documentation 1 emergencies documentation should include a telephone log of verbal quotes 2 true leases documentation should include written quotes costbenefit analysis of leasing versus purchasing etc requests for proposals may be used for obtaining true leases 3 secondhand equipment from other governments documentation should include market price comparisons verbal or written quotes and name of government 4 requests for proposals hereinafter referred to as rfp a request for proposal and evaluation of proposals should consider quality of service as well as price quality can be judged by factors such as experience staffing ability to respond within the time constraints established by the town and suitability for the needs of the town the award should be the most advantageous to the town from all perspectives not only cost but normally would include negotiations of cost a a wellplanned solicitation effort is needed to identify a sufficient number of qualified firms to locate qualified firms 13editors note said log is on file in the town offices  517 police department  518   519 public bid instructions one might advertise in trade journals check listings of professionals talk to other local officials etc although many firms may be active in a given locality not all are likely to have the specialized knowledge and experience needed to perform a satisfactory service a good solicitation effort helps to ensure that these qualified firms are aware of the governments needs and procurement procedures and are thereby able to participate in the proposal process b a wellplanned solicitation effort helps to encourage qualified firms to respond to rfps preparing a response to an rfp can be costly qualified firms may be unwilling to go to the trouble and expense of preparing a proposal if critical details of the engagement or the method used to select ie quality versus price are not made clear during the process c a wellplanned solicitation effort can result in reduced costs competition of course if not properly managed competition can produce unsatisfactory results a government may obtain a poorquality service for example if only cost factors are considered in the selection of a firm however if a sufficient pool of qualified firms is identified sound solicitation effort governments can enjoy the economic benefits of competition without sacrificing quality b depending on services obtained and specific circumstances procedures will necessarily vary the specific steps to be followed should be approved by the governing board the documentation maintained would include how firms were identified for solicitation the rfp the criteria for evaluating proposals the proposals for services received from the various firms and any other relevant information c since there is no requirement in  104b of the general municipal law as amended or changed on the frequency of solicitation periodic solicitation can be made at reasonable intervals for example a professional could be selected with the option reserved by the local government of extending the contract in succeeding years before initiating another rfp process d the following policy and procedure for securing professional services for the town of irondequoit is intended to provide guidance in preparation of requests for proposals and the administration of the rfp process a the town of irondequoit operates in a decentralized purchasing environment therefore when a public bid is required it is coordinated 14editors note see  5110  518 irondequoit code  519   5110 policy and procedure for securing professional services this policy and procedure shall be used by the town of irondequoit in the procurement of professional services including accountingauditing legal engineering architecture

by the department generating the greatest need for the itemsservices that responsibility includes these procedures to be followed 1 present itemsservices to economy task force to determine any needs

clerks office and ensure that representative from department attends bid opening 6 open bids review and prepare recommendation for town board 7 implement town board decision with all necessary followup administration 8 contact legal counsel for the town at any point during the process for all necessary legal advice b the above represents the normal bidding process if the situation merits a departure from these procedures it should be addressed accordingly at that time by the economy task force a when professional services are required by the town the town board shall be notified and the supervisor and comptroller together with the head of the department that requires said professional service shall prepare a scope of services for the project or need of the town that requires such professional services b at least three firms shall be solicited by the town for consideration as providers of the professional service factors to be considered in determining which firms to solicit will be 1 the disciplines required by the project 2 the experience of the firm on a particular type of project and any unique requirements of the project  519 police department  5110  3 the quality of

f proposals shall be formally evaluated and ranked as to order of preference by the selection committee interviews with each of the firms submitting proposals shall be held prior to ranking provided that if more than three firms submit proposals the selection committee may provide a preliminary assessment of all proposals and elect to interview no less than the top three firms an evaluation memorandum shall be prepared documenting the results of the evaluation and reasons for the selected ranking g when the ranking is completed negotiations shall be held with the topranked firm to establish detailed scope of such professional services a fair and reasonable fee for such professional services and other terms and conditions of the professional service agreement as may be necessary given the nature of the project or services sought in the event that negotiations are not successful the secondranked firm shall be invited to engage in a similar negotiation with the committee  and

provision by the comptroller subject to the approval of the town board and shall be added to the appendix herein15 similarly the thirdranked firm shall be so engaged in a negotiation if an agreement cannot be negotiated with the second h in the event that the selection committee cannot recommend any of the firms the entire process as described above shall be reinitiated i when negotiations are complete the selection committee shall present the scope of the professional services to be performed and the proposed fee to the town board for approval j whenever practical this process shall be used simultaneously when more than one project of a similar type exists for which professional services are required k this procedure need not apply to services with an estimated cost of less than $5000 in such cases the department proposing to utilize such professional service shall review the qualifications of firms capable of performing such professional service negotiate the scope of such professional service and the project work to be performed and establish fees for such professional service l the complete ranking sheet used by the selection committee shall be made available for

desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the town of irondequoit improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this article is to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the town of irondequoit
