that  2262 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the city and land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  a this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  b clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  c improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation  d impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  e substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the state  f stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  g the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety h regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse

array of uses  industrial commercial and residential in a compatible manner oriented around the mount vernon west train station specifically the mvw zone provides for i higher density residential development in close proximity to the mount vernon west train station and other modes of public transit ii the physical integration and coordination of diverse land uses iii development that is maximally transit supportive iv the creation of a pedestrian friendly environment v the provision of an alternative to traditional development that emphasizes mixed uses vi reduction of auto dependency and roadway congestion by locating multiple destinations and trip ends within walking distance of one another vii reduce total vehicle miles traveled and regional greenhouse gas emissions viii repair stabilize and revitalize the areas urban fabric ix facilitate new development and redevelopment that will create new jobs x position the area as a concentrated investment area xi strengthen the mount vernon gateway to mount vernon from yonkers xii emphasize support and facilitate high quality building design streetscape and public realm improvements d organization the mvw zone utilizes the concept of a form based set guidelines for development a form based code creates a predictable public realm by establishing guidelines and regulations that focus primarily on the physical form of the environment with a lesser focus on specific land use requirements form based codes address the relationships between building facades and the public realm the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another and the scale and types of streets and blocks the guidelines and standards in this form based code are presented in the narrative language of the code but also graphically to describe the character of anticipated development this is in contrast to conventional zoning s focus on the management and segregation of land uses presents the regulating plan which defines development areas within the mvw boundaries identifies the 8 allowable building types in the mvw district and indicates where the 51 building types are and are not permitted identifies the standards for building design configuration and placement presents the table of permitted uses identifies the parking requirements for the mvw district presents design guidelines in which all projects are expected to comply finally sets forth the administrative procedures in which all projects in the mvw district must comply e relationship to comprehensive plan the long range planning vision and strategy of the city of mount vernon has identified the mount vernon west area as a  higher intensity planning area this designation signifies a district where higher development density is targeted and encouraged through the efforts of the technical committee for mount vernon west a vision plan was developed that provided the foundation upon which the mount vernon west transit oriented development zoning constructed the mount vernon west transit oriented development zoning therefore fully consistent with long range planning vision and strategy for the mount vernon west area and represents the implementation of that vision f planning principles the mount vernon west transit oriented development zoning an efficient effective and equitable regulatory and procedural code for the use of land in the mount vernon west area subject to the following policies i the area should include a framework of transit pedestrian and bicycle systems that provide alternatives to the automobile ii development in the area should be compact pedestrian oriented and contain a mix of uses iii the development of isolated single use buildings and sites should be avoided iv the ordinary activities of daily living should be provided within walking distance of residential uses allowing for independence from the automobile v the layout and configuration of development should be designed to disperse traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips vi within the area a range of housing types and price levels should be provided to accommodate diverse ages and incomes vii appropriate land uses and densities should be provided within walking distance to the train station viii civic institutional and commercial activity should be embedded throughout the area and not isolated into remote single use complexes ix a range of open space including parks squares plazas and playgrounds should be distributed throughout the area x buildings landscaping and other amenities should contribute to the physical definition of thoroughfares as public places xi development should adequately accommodate automobiles while respecting pedestrians and the spatial form of public areas 52 xii the design of buildings and sites should reinforce safe environments but not at the expense of accessibility xiii architecture and landscape design should reflect the history and traditions topography climate and building practices of the city of mount vernon xiv public gathering places should be provided as locations that reinforce community identity and support selfgovernment xv the preservation and renewal of historic buildings or the incorporation of historical architectural elements characteristic of the city of mount vernon should be facilitated to affirm the continuity and evolution of society non conforming uses and buildings the mvw district replaces zoning that was predominantly industrial while many of the industrial uses have left the area and a number of properties in the area are underutilized viable industrial uses do remain in places the mvw zoning provides for the addition of a broad array of uses including high density residential uses facilitating the coexistence of diverse land uses represents one of the challenges in the mvw district the regulations governing non conforming uses set forth in remain applicable to uses and buildings in the mvw district however all legal preexisting non conforming uses are encouraged to comply with the design guidelines established herein to assure that the area evolves in a manner that is consistent with the goals and objectives of the city 53 2 regulating plan the regulating plan divides the mvw zone into five separate areas of development intensity this approach differs from conventional zoning that typically divides a city into zones that rigidly segregate residential commercial industrial and institutional uses thereby emphasizing a dependence on automobiles to functionally connect uses the use of zones based on development intensity  instead of land uses provides a new spatial basis for regulating development that recognizes the interrelationships between uses the three zones also provide an effective vehicle to implement the city s urban design objectives while fostering attractive and sympathetic interfaces between zones the following zones are established within the mvw district mvw h mvw hub mvw h nc mvw hub  non commercial mvwc mvw corridor mvwt mvw transition mvwt nc mvw transition  non commercial a mvw hub mvwh the mvw hub zone is designed to accommodate the highest intensity

transit opportunities available at the station to minimize reliance on individual passenger vehicles parking demands and associated traffic impacts the mvw h zone also allows for the greatest

north side of north terrace avenue between mount vernon avenue and grove street it includes all of the attributes of the mvw h zone except commercial uses are prohibited this allows for an appropriate juxtaposition between the existing residential uses on the east side of north terrace avenue with potential new development in the mvwh zone c mvw corridor mvwc the mvw corridor zone provides the physical link between the mvw hub and the downtown this corridor provides the gateway into the mount vernon from yonkers and anchors the western edge of the downtown at west lincoln avenue the emphasis in this area is on retail retail service and restaurant uses along the ground floor of the buildings lining the corridor to create an economically vibrant and bustling commercial and mixed use area that will unite the mvw hub with the downtown d mvw transition  mvwt the mvw transition zone lies to the east of the mvw hub and flanks the mvw corridor zones this area offers the potential for residential redevelopment at increased densities redevelopment will likely require the assembly of parcels the mvwt zone will provide for a logical and gradual transition from the higher densities

the area to various other destinations rather than driving from one location to another design emphasis and priority is given to pedestrian circulation as a result the required parking in the mvw district reflects reduced offstreet parking ratios for certain uses the use of shared parking is also permitted and encouraged the offstreet parking requirements established in the table of off street parking and loading requirements set forth in attachment 3 shall apply unless modified below in which case the requirements of this section shall apply a off street parking requirements use required

of shared parking whereby land uses that have different parking demand patterns are able to use the same parking spaces throughout the day is particularly useful in a transit oriented development district where a large percentage of trips are accommodated via public transit public transit reduces the overall demand for individual passenger vehicle trips and the related demand for parking shared parking is permitted and encouraged in the mvw district the city council if the application is subject to review by the city council or planning board in all other instances may consider the use of shared parking according to the following provisions the uses proposing to share parking spaces are different land uses as set forth in the permitted use table all new development that relies on shared parking must demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed parking as a result of a capacity being provided that will substantially meet the intent of the parking requirements by reason of variation in the probable time of maximum use by residents patrons visitors or employees among residences and establishments sharing such parking and provided that said approval of such joint use shall be automatically terminated upon the termination of the operation of any use on which the shared parking analysis has been based the analysis of shared parking must be based on established standards methodology in cases where shared parking is proposed between adjacent parcels under separate ownership irrevocable cross easements shall be required to assure the perpetual right to share the parking spaces no more than 50% of the required parking for a particular use shall be provided in a shared parking arrangement 79 c design and layout the design and layout of offstreet parking

parking structures shall be designed using compatible or complementary materials to the principal buildings so that they blend in architecturally all voids in the structures shall be architecturally treated or screened so that lights and vehicles are not individually visible parking structures fronting on macquesten avenue and mount vernon avenue shall be wrapped by first floor non residential uses surface parking shall include street lighting that adequately provides for safe vehicle circulation and public safety but shall not be excessive light poles shall be as low as possible to achieve the desired purpose and fixtures shall be shielded and downward directed the use of energy efficient luminaries is encouraged all pedestrian pathways across and along parking areas shall be appropriately lit with pedestrian scaled lighting fixtures vehicular access to internal parking structures shall be designed so as not to negatively impact upon major pedestrian routes if necessary provide  fish eye mirrors or alarms to manage the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles the potential conflicts between truck delivery vehicular traffic and pedestrian circulation shall be

of the mvw form based code describes recommended design practices that have been established to create a high quality pedestrian friendly urban environment oriented around the mount vernon west train station the principles described in this section are not considered mandatory development standards however all projects are strongly encouraged to utilize this section to design projects that meet the purpose and intent of these guidelines the ultimate approval of projects will be judged in accordance with these design practices ground floor facades in the context of a transit oriented district where pedestrian activity is emphasized the design and activation of the ground floor base is imperative the concept of  build to lines assures that new buildings will front on the public streetscape creating visual interest along the base of the building by assuring a high percentage of transparency in storefront windows is a design goal facade details are encouraged to vary the building texture highlight facade articulation and break up the building mass the provision of security grates air conditioning units or other similar fixtures on the principal facade must be avoided architectural details building architecture creates an interesting visual environment and provides a basis for the overall character of an area architectural details are those elements that do not contribute structurally to a building s construction but add visual interest identify building styles and often display superior craftsmanship they should not be used however as a substitute for genuine building massing and articulation new construction should emphasize the use and application of a high degree of architectural detailing building renovations should strive to preserve unique or native vernacular details 86 corner building wraps structures located on corner lots should be designed with multiple front facades to create a continuous pedestrian friendly and attractive public realm while one side of the building may support the primary entrance both sides of the building on a corner lot must be functionally activated service areas and building mechanical equipment should not be located along either building frontage on a corner lot 87 functional entries to improve the pedestrian experience and to facilitate the activation of the public realm surrounding individual buildings pedestrian access points  functional entries should be easily identifiable inviting and accessible and located along the public frontage as often as practical maximizing the number of functional entries also helps to create interesting and diverse street level architecture access ways into the buildings may be into lobbies commercial spaces or common areas all functional entries should meet ada requirements and be adequately lit ebi 1888 11as rccyccr acan hnm o ix+f h 88 building off sets building off sets serve to break up large monotonous building facades and increase the amount of light and openness at the street level the mvw building type regulations establish specific building mass requirements which include building off set provisions these are established as minimum requirements further variations to facades are encouraged in instances when physical off sets are impractical an architectural element that alters the buildings facade plane can be utilized 89 building transitions the transitional edge of the mvw district requires careful attention to assure appropriate bulk and height of structures adjacent to lower density residential neighborhoods the massing of taller structures should be organized in a way that minimizes the apparent bulk and height of new buildings this can be accomplished in three ways  by careful selection of building types at the zone s edges providing landscape buffers or setbacks and providing off sets in taller buildings 90 building materials the choice of materials used for construction or renovating buildings affects the way a building relates to its neighborhood context when designed well a building can contribute to the continuity of street elevation as well as emphasize a site s unique characteristics buildings constructed with complementary materials contribute to the interest of a streetscape consequently a building s design  particularly the facade  and exterior materials can have a significant impact on how the structure is perceived exterior walls shall be clad in materials that are durable and are appropriate to the visual environment and climate design flexibility and creativity is encouraged using ornamentation that is consistent with the overall character of the city of mount vernon the use of materials such as stone brick and wood is preferred 91 windows & doors building windows and doors are not only simply utilitarian elements but also provide ornament adding materially to the regularity and elegance of the building the dimensions and style of windows and doors and patterns of fenestration should have a relationship to the surrounding neighborhood to create a visual rhythm along the street and a sense of continuity among structures 92 signs the provision of high quality signage both as a communication tool and as a component of building form is a goal in the mvw district creative and unique sign designs are encouraged while cluttered and unattractive streetscapes must be prevented in general effectively designed signs should respond to the site landscape and architectural design context within which they are located signs should be compatible in scale proportion and design with the building s facade and its surroundings painted window signs should not be too large or obscure transparency internally illuminated  sign boxes should be avoided as should excessive lighting of all varieties projecting signs perpendicular to the sidewalk are effective when properly scaled for pedestrian use graphics should be welldesigned and legible the use of neon can be acceptable when employed properly the signage requirements established in shall apply big stellas ver n_e 93 site lighting effective exterior site lighting is an important element in the overall appearance and operation of a project the quality of light level of light as measured in footcandles and the type of bulb or source should be carefully addressed lighting levels should not be so intense as to draw attention to the glow or glare of the project site the lighting plan should incorporate current energyefficient fixtures such as led and similar technologies spotlighting or glare from any site lighting should be shielded from adjacent properties and directed at a specific object or target area to prevent light trespass exposed bulbs should not be used building light fixtures should be designed or selected to be architecturally compatible with the main structure the height of tight poles should be appropriately scaled to the project 94 building services to create a more attractive pedestrian friendly environment utilitarian features such as trash facilities loading docks hvac equipment and above ground utility infrastructure should be out of the public s view ground level services should be located at the rear of the building if possible a screen wall should be used to camouflage the service features if optimal placement does not adequately screen the features from the public realm landscape treatments may be appropriate to soften the interface of the equipment the location design and visibility of vehicular drivethru facilities should respect the pedestrian environment the desired urban density and the aesthetics of the facility drivethru entrance and exit lanes should not be located on the primary pedestrian thoroughfares of macquesten parkway or mount vernon avenue drivethu bays stacking areas and queues should be screened from the public realm 95 project open spaces residential developments and mixed use projects require the provision of usable open space for residents these amenities increase light and air to dwelling units enhance the aesthetics of projects and the environmental quality of neighborhoods promote physical activity afford stormwater management opportunities increase social interaction opportunities with neighbors and increase safety by providing  eyes on the space usable open space can be provided in outdoor spaces such as courtyards walkways rooftops balconies and terraces and garden plots indoor facilities such as fitness centers or swimming pools can also be used to meet the usable open space requirements of a project unique features such as green roofs and green or  living walls are also beneficial open space amenities 96 streetscape great streetscapes are the center of public life they brand a neighborhood giving it a cultural identity and shaping the perceptions of the area the elements of the streetscape can create a place of vitality and activity the streetscape is composed of 3 zones  the pedestrian zone public amenity zone and frontage zone sidewalks a minimum of 15 wide are required throughout the district curb cuts should be minimized and clearly marked street trees with grates should be provided at 30 intervals planters are encouraged containing seasonal plantings and flowers wayfinding signage should be provided to assist pedestrian navigation area banners and flags can be used to announce special events and to help brand the district as can public art street and pedestrian lighting should illuminate at a level consistent with pedestrian activity benches seating and other street furniture should be selectively sited to take advantage of sunshine in winter and shade in summer the provision of bus stops is an essential component to the mvw district as are bicycle racks that should be located at regular intervals pontarhzone pc aeon tar zone u d t s pwjk pubticatnenty zone 97 traffic calming the safety of pedestrians and cyclists in a transit oriented district is imperative traffic calming is an effective method to minimize conflicts between motorists and pedestrians traffic calming involves changes in street alignment installation of barriers and other physical measures to reduce traffic speeds and or cut in the interest of street safety livability and other public purposes traffic calming measures include speed humps speed tables raised crosswalks raised intersections textured pavement traffic circles roandabouts chicanes neck downs chokers among other measures 98 pedestrian & bicycle circulation in order to facilitate pedestrian movement throughout the district sidewalks a minimum of 15 wide are required pedestrian crosswalks across streets should have pedestrian controls  walk don t walk signals and improved with a different pavement treatment to differentiate it from the street paving corner clearances should be minimized neck downs so that the distance a pedestrian must cross the road is reduced larger surface parking lots should provide separate pedestrian connects parking lot bicycle circulation should be accommodated via the provision of defined bike lanes  4 in width and signed bike routes shortterm bike parking bike racks in retail areas and longterm bike parking  lockers covered corrals etc at commutation points and businesses are necessary businesses should provide on site shower and changing facilities for employees 99 landscaping landscaping enhances the visual image of the city preserves natural features improves property values and alleviates the impact of noise traffic and visual distraction associated with certain uses it aids in energy conservation and promotes urban wildlife habitats trees and shrubs should be located and spaced to allow for longterm growth evergreen and deciduous or flowering trees should be used in combination to create visual interest and to create a dynamic landscape accent planting should be used around entries and key activity hubs screening should be used to protect less intensive uses from the impacts of more intrusive uses and to block views of less desirable features from public view trash enclosures etc the use of native plants is preferred xeriscaping is encouraged to promote water conservation reduce maintenance requirements and decrease flooding recycled grey water should be used for irrigation landscaping should be coordinated with stormwater management plans and features such as rain gardens and planted infiltration basins should be considered 100 sustainability & green building sustainability and green building refers to the practice of creating structures using a process that is environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building s lifecycle  from siting to design construction operation maintenance renovation and demolition elements include the construction of buildings that are energy efficient  high levels of insulation high performance windows and that use renewable resources  passive solar heating daylighting are designed for durability future reuse and adaptability use low maintenance building materials with low embodied energy building materials should be locally sourced with a high percentage of salvaged and recycled materials install high efficiency heating and cooling equipment high efficient lights and appliances and water efficient equipment 101 bird friendly building design bird collisions with tall buildings have been identified as a significant issue particularly during the spring and fall migrations reducing bird mortality can be accomplished by employing bird friendly building techniques three basic design techniques exist to minimize bird collisions minimize the use of glass place glass behind screening use glass with properties that reduce collisions design techniques include the use of netting screens grilles shutters and exterior shades  employing awnings and overhangs  using angled glass  using patterned glass  using uv patterned glass  using opaque or translucent glass  using window films  applying decals or tape or installing interior shades or blinds reference should be made to the new york city audubon society publication  bird friendly building design g 4 d r4 11441 i  a  t al g illonompvii 4 102 10 administration the transit oriented pedestrian friendly zoning standards and requirements set forth
