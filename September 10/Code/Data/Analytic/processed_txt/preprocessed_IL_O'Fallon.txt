structure passed 2222005   hydraulics hydraulic calculations for pipes culverts and open channels are to be as follows agravity versus pressure flow for enclosed systems 1two design philosophies exist for sizing storm drains under the steady uniform flow assumption the first is referred to as open channel or gravity flow design in which the water surface within the conduit remains open to atmospheric pressure pressure flow design on the other hand requires that the flow in the conduit be at a pressure greater than atmospheric for a given flow rate design based on open channel flow requires larger conduit sizes than those sized based on pressure flow while it may be more expensive to construct storm drainage systems designed based on open channel flow this design procedure provides a margin of safety by providing additional headroom in the conduit to accommodate an increase in flow above the design discharge however there may be situations where pressure flow design is desirable for example on some projects there may be adequate headroom between the conduit and inletaccess hole elevations to tolerate pressure flow in this case a significant cost savings may be realized over the cost of a system designed to maintain open channel flow also in some cases it may be necessary to use an existing system which must be placed under pressure flow to accommodate the proposed design flow rates under most ordinary conditions it is recommended that storm drains be sized based on a gravity flow criteria at full flow or near full pressure flow design may be justified in certain instances as hydraulic calculations are performed frequent verification of the existence of the desired flow condition should be made storm drainage systems can often alternate between pressure and open channel flow conditions from one section to another from urban drainage design manual hydraulic engineering circular no 22 us department of transportation federal highway

friction head loss is the hazenwilliams formula the hazenwilliams formula gives good results for liquids that have kinematic viscosities around 12 ee5 ft2sec corresponding to 60f water the hazenwilliams formula should be used only for turbulent flow the hazenwilliams head loss is hf     v185  l     c185  d where c   loss coefficient determined from hw chart for various pipe materials

egl using the energy loss method is presented in  75 of the urban drainage design manual hydraulic engineering circular no 22 us department of transportation federal highway administration for most drainage systems computer methods such as hydra or swmm are the most efficient means of evaluating the egl and designing the system elements cculverts classified as having either entrance or outlet control either the inlet opening entrance control or friction loss within the culvert or backwater from the downstream system outlet control will control the discharge capacity 1entrance control entrance control occurs when the culvert is hydraulically short when the culvert is not flowing full and steep flow at the entrance would be critical as the water falls over the brink if the tailwater covers the culvert completely ie a submerged exit the culvert will be full at that point even though the inlet control forces the culvert to be only partially full at the inlet the transition from partially full to full occurs in a hydraulic jump the location of which depends on the flow resistance and water levels if the flow resistance is very high or if the headwater and tailwater levels are high enough the jump will occur close to or at the entrance 2outlet control aif the flow in a culvert is full for its entire length then the flow is said to be under outlet control the discharge will be a function of the differences in tailwater and headwater levels as well as the flow resistance along the barrel length balternatively refer to the federal highway administration website for these

design of highway culverts from wwwfhwadotgovbridgehydsofthtm these are applicable when flow in the upstream channel is subcritical 3open channelsbridges aproper evaluation of the velocity depth and width of flow requires analyses of the structures and conditions that impact the flow boundary flow conditions upstream and downstream from the open channel system must be established the standardstep backwater method using the energy equation can be used to determine the depth velocity and width of flow major stream obstructions changes in slope changes in crosssection and other flow controls can cause significant energy loss in these cases the energy equation does not apply and the momentum equation must be used to determine the depth velocity and width of flow bhydraulic calculations for

detention basin may be designed to drain dry or to retain water for extended periods after rain events all detentionretention basins must be properly maintained and kept free of algae growth trash and other debris 5the depthareavolume relationship of the basin is dependent on the storage volume needed to reduce the peak inflow rate to some desired peak outflow rate as the natural contours in the site dictate ponding depths should be kept as shallow as possible however where storm water storage depths exceed four feet a bench width of six feet should be provided around the entire perimeter of the basin exclusive of bermed areas outlets from normally dry detention basins can take on a number of forms limited only by safety and maintenance considerations outlet pipe must be at least 12

ecological or visual values for the community within the city riparian corridors located along naturally occurring drainage channels have been identified as critical environmental resources within the community these corridors form important visual and recreational opportunities for the community which inturn create economic value when correctly preserved as amenities within developed parcels bintent this section is provided to govern the preservation of all existing landformtopographic conditions and vegetative cover within identified environmental corridors riparian corridors identified in the environmentallandscape framework plan are defined as those natural drainage channels having tree canopy or other vegetative cover andor soils generally associated with continuous or intermittent drainage or flooding for purposes of the plan riparian corridors have been identified by visual means using current aerial photographs that indicate tree canopy cover over or within natural drainage channels capplicability this section shall apply to any land disturbance or construction of any structure within any area designated as a riparian corridor as set forth in the environmentallandscape framework plan the boundaries of which are more specifically set forth in the plans map appendix to the extent that a parcel is only partially subject to the riparian corridor

prohibited except as may be specifically permitted by special use permit issued pursuant to   this chapter and this subchapter and subject to the additional standards established in this section if construction is proposed as part of a planned use no separate special use permit is needed estandards no special use permit shall be granted pursuant to this section except in conformance with the standards established in the environmentallandscape framework plan and the standards established in   this chapter as applied to the riparian corridor the issuance of a special use permit shall require maximum preservation of vegetation and tree canopy and shall include mitigation conditions to ensure that any disturbance within the riparian corridor is minimized and adequately restored and mitigated where disturbance cannot be reasonably avoided frequirements if it is determined that a portion of a riparian corridor is located on the site of a proposed subdivision or development

riparian corridors identified as part of a submitted site plan without prior written approval by the city such review and approval by the city is required in order to maintain a citywide functional storm water management system and important environmental functions of these areas griparian corridor x zone the x zone of the riparian corridor is a critical zone of vegetative cover and soil conditions that provides for drainage channel bank stability and erosion control current tree canopy along most of the identified riparian corridors occurs within the width of the x zone and in addition to the erosion control created by the vegetation within the zone the zone creates primary wildlife habitat and movement corridors the zones tree canopy a remnant of the forests which covered much of the citys landscape prior to agricultural use and development creates important visual qualities for the city development and preservation criteria for the x zone include 1a minimum width of
