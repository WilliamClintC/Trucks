safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding streambank and channel erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include greenspace with the citys greenspace protection plan  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and

iv  stormwater utility findings the city council makes the following findings 1 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 2 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the professional engineering and financial analysis the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure 3 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its program operational and capital improvement needs 4 the professional engineering and financing analysis known as the stormwater utility implementation report prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy 5 given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs 6 the city council finds concludes and determines that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city 7 an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of stormwater user fee charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality andor quantity control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city such a schedule of user fee charges can be supplemented by other funding sourcesmethods to address specific needs including but not limited to allocations from the general fund based on the recommended funding strategy it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater management services continue to be funded from the citys general fund tax revenues and therefore that the city council may allocate general fund tax revenues to support the stormwater management program in the future in the form of a combination of user fee charge payments for cityowned properties and supplemental allocation from the general fund in addition the city may utilize and allocate other supplemental funding sourcesmethods to address specific stormwater management program requirements including but not limited to development review and inspection fees special purpose local option sales taxes splost revenue bonds loans and any other supplemental funding sources that can be appropriately utilized to fund the citys comprehensive stormwater management program 8 a credit to the stormwater user fee charge is an appropriate means of adjusting the user fee charge in recognition of the specific efforts and associated costs undertaken by qualified private properties and their stormwater management control systems that effectively reduce the burden of stormwater runoff quantity andor quality impacts from private property that the city would have to otherwise manage at its own cost and expense mitigation of stormwater runoff impacts is accomplished by properly designing constructing and maintaining stormwater controls that reduce the impact that land development activities and impervious surfaces have on the citys drainage system 2575 5162005 definitions

purpose of this chapter is to protect preserve and enhance the rural and wooded character of the city protection and landscaping  to establish protective regulations for trees in the city and to better control problems of flooding soil erosion air pollution heat gain and noise in the city and to make the city a more attractive healthier and safer place in which to live this chapter is intended to further the citys goal that all development sites where trees are most commonly removed will achieve upon project completion a uniform standard in connection with tree coverage b findings trees are a valuable asset to the ruralurban environment of the city and generate such benefits as 1 the purification of air  2 the moderation of the microclimate  3 the reduction of noise and glare  4 the conservation of energy in terms of heating and cooling  5 the prevention of soil erosion  6 reduced costs in terms of stormwater management  7 the minimization of flood potential  8 improved water quality  9 the enhancement and stabilization of property values  10 increased aesthetics  and 11 the preservation of rural character c intent the intent of this chapter is to encourage the protection of trees within the city which the city stands to lose unless protective measures are taken the intent is not punitive or to cause hardship to any individual or governmental agency or private or public company who uses every care and diligence to protect trees within the city  nor is it meant to inflate the cost of development over a reasonable value of the trees involved a2

states excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal clean water act riverstream bank means the rising ground bordering a river or a stream which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow significant recharge area means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in hydrologic atlas 18 1998 edition mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area litho logy sol type thickness slope density of litho logy contracts geologic structure presence of karts and potentionmetric surfaces significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of the state 1 in the piedmont and in the blue ridge rocks have little primary porosity with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils 2 the significant recharge are those with thicker soils 3 field mapping indicates thick soils in the piedmont and blue ridge are characterized by a density of tow ore more geologic contracts per four square miles

water supply watershed district 1 description in order to provide for the health safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured the ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs in addition stormwater runoff particularly from impervious surfaces can introduce toxicants nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies making water treatment more complicated expensive and rendering water resources unusable industrial land uses that involve the manufacturer use transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies 2 purpose the purpose of the

provide site amenities consistent with the provisions of subsection a1b and link those areas to similar areas on adjoining property which currently exist or could reasonably be utilized as open space shall retain a minimum of ten percent of the gross site acreage in improved open space 2 the second purpose of the open space reservation is related to the storm drainage pattern of the city as a rural community the city relies on surface runoff systems and has no significant infrastructure in storm drainage this system depends on a great deal of porous surfaces and open areas to function properly the cost of construction of a storm drainage utility system is prohibitive as a result the city must protect its open areas and natural storm drainage system this protection will be achieved of the provisions of this section in all development projects proposed for rm4 rm8 rct o&i c3 m1 m2 and pd districts on sites greater than oneacre b projects which alter the sites natural drainage system by grading an area greater than 50 percent of the gross acreage of the site or by installing drainage structures requiring piping above 18 inches in diameter shall retain 30 percent of the

12142015  exh a 12142015  exh a 5232016 purpose the mayor and council find that 1 proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable orderly and safely designed business environment 2 the purposes of these sign regulations are to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city 3 an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public 4 the result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation improper placement illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and impede vision of traffic traffic controls signs and devices 5 uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage and that impedes the flow of information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians 6 uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism visitation and permanent economic growth 7 through proper regulation of signs the attractiveness and economic wellbeing of the city of fairburn will be enhanced as a place to live work and conduct business 8 signs provide an important medium individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages however left unregulated signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the citys public welfare the mayor and council intend by enacting this article to a balance the rights of individuals to convey their message the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs  b further the objectives of the citys comprehensive plan  c protect the public health safety welfare and aesthetics of the city  d reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards  e improve pedestrian and traffic safety  f maintain the historical image of the city  g protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs  h promote economic development and growth  i protect the public traveling along the highways from distractions aesthetic desecration and nuisances all associated with the proliferation of signs in a concentrated area along the highway turner communications corp v georgia dept of transp 139 ga app 436 228 se2d 399 1976  and j ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations 9 further the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods to protect property against blight and deprivation and encourage the most appropriate use of land buildings and other structures throughout the city 10 the citys intention in enacting sign legislation has never been directed at nor enforced against the content of the signs but has rather focused on the physical characteristics of the sign structures 11 the city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function for instance signs at the entrances to subdivisions of developments are for the purpose of providing guidance and to enable both the traveling public and public safety personnel responding to emergencies to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls while such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow the maximum expressive potential to sign owners the city further finds that holiday decorations are not signs but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter 12 accordingly in consideration of the citys rights and obligations to promote traffic safety to preserve property values to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel to eliminate annoyance to travelers to attract tourists residents and industry to serve the public health safety and morals to advance the general prosperity of the community and to serve the general welfare the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this article 13 the city council finds that there is a compelling state interest in the city and state being able to safely regulate the speed direction and flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around public roads streets and sidewalks and quasipublic roads streets and sidewalks in private property where the general public invited by the owner routinely and customarily to enters transverses and parks by vehicle andor by foot the city has a compelling state interest in the public safety and welfare of motorist and pedestrians in these areas the safe and expedient access of public safety vehicles such as police fire and rescue equipment to such areas the city has a compelling state interest to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic such as to prevent or minimize collisions and the injury or death to persons caused thereby or the damage to property both public and private therefore the city determines that there is a compelling state interest in the citys police chief regulating the type traffic control message and placement of all traffic control signs and devices in the areas described above the city also has a compelling state interest in insuring that private entities are not allowed to display in the areas described above signs that imitate or emulate traffic instructional and control signs devices or messages in such a way as may reasonably be mistaken by the public as true traffic control signs or devices and thereby could reasonably be expected to cause a motorist or pedestrian to make an improper maneuver which will place the motorist or pedestrian or other motorist or pedestrian in danger of collision or injury due to such improper maneuver therefore the city has a compelling state interest in regulating such signs in the areas described above which imitate or emulate a traffic instructional and control sign or device and which may reasonably be confusing to motorists or pedestrians in these areas exh
