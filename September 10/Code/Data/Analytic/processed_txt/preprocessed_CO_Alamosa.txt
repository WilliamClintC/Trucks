governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations   3514  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage   3514  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains  electric and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area   3514  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands   3514  definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter

precise location of any zone boundary line shown on the zoning map shall be identified using the rules set out in this section it is the intent of the city council that all land within the city of

development or use of said land shall be issued until the city council adopts an initial zoning ordinance for the land such action shall be taken at the city councils first available regular meeting after the city discovers that the land is not zoned b conflicts between zoning map and adopted rezoning ordinance after effective date of udc conflicts between the zone boundaries on the zoning map

1 it is presumed that the adopted rezoning ordinance controls and the zoning map shall be promptly corrected when the conflict is identified in such a case the administrator shall provide written notice of the correction to the owners of property that is the subject of a zoning map correction 2 the presumption may be rebutted if it is obvious that the error is within the text of the rezoning ordinance in that a the rezoning affects property that was not the subject of the application for rezoning  or b the rezoning affects only a portion of the property that was the subject of the application the application requested rezoning for the entire property and the application was granted without conditions that restricted the extent of the rezoning  or c the legal description of the land in the rezoning ordinance does not close but the description of the land that was intended to be the subject of the rezoning ordinance is otherwise obvious c conflict between zoning map and adopted rezoning ordinance before effective date of udc any conflict between the boundaries on the zoning map and a rezoning ordinance that was adopted before the effective date of this udc shall be

unit development pud ordinance that was adopted before the effective date the pud ordinance controls unless there is record evidence to show that the zoning map was intended to adjust the boundaries of the pud 3 if the zoning map conflicts with an inactive pud ordinance or with the boundary of a completed pud then the zoning map controls 4 if the zoning map conflicts with a development or annexation agreement then the conflict shall be resolved according to the terms of the agreement d identifiable features in the absence of a rezoning ordinance that specifies parcel boundaries where zoning district boundary lines appear to follow identifiable features their location shall be determined by applying the rules of this subsection in order from 1 to 5 1 rightsofway boundary lines shown as following or approximately following streets alleys railroad tracks or utility lines shall be construed as following the centerline of the rightofway where the location of the actual streets or alleys differs from the location of corresponding streets or alleys on the zoning map the location of the actual streets or alleys controls 2 property lines boundary lines shown as following or approximately following lot lines or other property lines shown on the zoning map shall be construed as following such lines 3 toe or top of slope boundary lines shown as following or approximately

centerline of streams or other watercourses shall be construed as following the channel centerline in the event of a natural change in the location of such streams or other watercourses the zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline however such movement shall not render existing development nonconforming 5 parallel to features boundaries shown as separated from and parallel or approximately parallel to any of the features listed in subsections d1 d4 above shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances as are shown by the scale on the zoning map e unsubdivided land or no identifiable feature in the absence of a rezoning ordinance that specifies parcel boundaries on unsubdivided land or where a district boundary

trends deterioration development transitions etc  and b the proposed zone allows for the reasonable development or redevelopment of the subject property in a manner that will be compatible with its existing or planned context 3 alternative #3 the proposed zone is more appropriate than the existing zone because a there is greater need in the city for land in the proposed zone than the existing zone  and b the proposed zone will promote a balance of land uses in the city that will improve economic opportunity for city residents 4 alternative #4 the proposed zone is more appropriate than the existing zone because a the existing zoning for the property was erroneously assigned  or b development has not proceeded in reliance on the erroneous zone  1 12617 division 22  land use

proposed use is not listed in the land use tables of sections 212201 to 212208 inclusive or in section 212209 then the proposal shall be evaluated pursuant to this section the evaluation will determine whether the proposal is a permitted limited conditional or prohibited use or whether it is something other than a principal use as such is defined by this udc b findings and intent 1 the city council recognizes that there is a middleground between the position that all uses that are not specifically permitted by the udc are prohibited and the position that all uses that are not specifically prohibited by the udc are allowed the city council finds a the former places too much burden on the right to use property and is therefore not consistent with the values of the residents of the city  and b the latter would frustrate the purposes and administration of this udc by inviting arguments regarding whether a particular use is included in the list of uses regulated by this udc and creating uncertainty that undermines the stability upon which many residents and real estate investors depend for their lifestyles and livelihoods 2 this section is intended to provide a middle ground it is the intent of this section to create sufficient flexibility to allow for property owners to establish new uses that are not specifically identified in this udc without placing upon the property owner the burden of waiting for the city to initiate and process an ordinance amending this udc 3 this section should be interpreted to favor the establishment of the new use accordingly if a new use meets the threshold determination under subsection d below and is comparable to two 2 or more listed uses then the listed use which is allowed with the least process shall be selected as the comparable use 4 it is the intent of the city council to provide flexibility but not to allow this section to be used to avoid the application of this udc likewise it also is the intent of the city council that this section not be used to create rules and regulations that are not part of this udc c application 1 the first step of this process the threshold determination in subsection d below is to determine whether a proposed use is a principal use under this udc and not something else like a temporary use or a structure that should be allowed without city approval or with a more limited administrative review eg a staff review a building permit etc 2 if a proposed unlisted use is a principal use then it is the intent of city council that it be approved in the same manner and under the same conditions as the single listed use to which the proposed use is most closely functionally comparable see subsection e below 3 if a proposed unlisted use is not a principal use then it is the intent of the city council to ensure that it is classified appropriately as a temporary land use an accessory use a part of an existing principal use an accessory building or structure or a sign that classification shall be used to determine if any requirements of this udc apply d threshold determination 1 the administrator shall review the description of the proposed use and decide whether the proposed use is a a principal land use  b a seasonal land use  c a temporary land use  d an accessory use  e an accessory building or structure  f a sign  g mechanical water wastewater electrical equipment or communications equipment which provides services to a building or use on the applicants property and not to other properties  h essential services  or i an area or activity that is a customary part of the existing or approved principal use of the applicants property 2 proposed principal land uses shall be evaluated according to the standards of subsection e below other classifications listed subsections d1b to d1i above do not require further analysis under this section but may be subject to other requirements of this udc according to its terms or to the building codes or to other parts of the city of alamosa municipal e functionally comparable principal uses new or changed principal uses are permitted limited conditional or prohibited in the same manner as uses to which they are most closely functionally comparable an unlisted use is functionally comparable to a listed use if with regard to each of the decision criteria below the unlisted use is categorically similar eg a residential use is not functionally comparable to an industrial use even if it could otherwise meet the standards of this subsection and has no greater negative impacts than listed use to which it is being compared 1 average daily and peak hour trip generation personal vehicles and heavy trucks  2 impervious surface  3 regulated air or water emissions  4 noise  5 ground

projectiles leaving the site etc  10 use and storage of hazardous materials  11 secondary impacts on the community eg increased crime or threats to public health or degradation of historic resources  or 12 implementation of the comprehensive plan f effect of determination 1 if the administrator finds that an unlisted use is most closely functionally comparable to a permitted limited or conditional use then an application for approval of the unlisted use at a particular location shall be processed with the same restrictions as the listed use that is functionally comparable 2 if the administrator determines that an unlisted use is most closely functionally comparable to a prohibited use or is not functionally comparable to any listed use then the unlisted use is a prohibited use g recordkeeping  proposed amendment the administrator shall keep a record of all determinations of functionally comparable uses the administrator may propose an amendment to this udc to incorporate such

wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment be designed and sited in a manner that is sensitive to and in scale and harmony with the character of the community as such the purpose of this division is to provide design standards specific to wireless telecommunications facilities in order to ensure their compatibility with the surrounding environment and existing and anticipated development patterns b intent 1 these regulations are intended to provide predictable consistent and balanced standards for the siting and screening of wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment on private property within the city in order to a preserve the character and aesthetics of areas that are in close proximity to wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment by minimizing the visual aesthetic and safety impacts of such facilities and equipment design siting screening and placement  b protect the health safety and welfare of persons living recreating or working in the area surrounding wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment as they relate to the placement construction or modification of such facilities  c provide development that is compatible in appearance with allowed uses of the underlying zone  d ensure that the city does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services  e encourage colocation and clustering of antenna sites and structures when practical to help reduce the number of such facilities that may be required in the future to service the needs of customers and thus avert unnecessary proliferation of facilities and related equipment  and f ensure the timely processing of applications for insubstantial changes to existing wireless telecommunications facilities see section 218521 for approval procedures 2 it is not the intent of these regulations to regulate the

12617 calculation of required parking spaces a generally parking tables sets out the number of parking spaces that are required for each land use that is listed in article 2 division 2 land use the number of parking spaces is based on one 1 or more independent variables which are measured as provided in this section b independent variables the independent variables for parking calculations are measured as follows 1 floor area where the independent variable is square feet square feet the number of parking spaces is based on the number of square feet occupied by the use or occupied by a component of the use that is specified in the table 2 dwelling unit where the independent variable is a dwelling unit u the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of dwelling units in some cases the parking requirements are based on the number of bedrooms per # bru in each dwelling unit 3 bed where the independent variable is bed the number of parking spaces is based on the number of beds in the facility instead of the number of bedrooms or some other measure perbed calculations are typically applied to uses that offer residential care or overnight accommodations with shared rooms 4 employee the phrase per employee means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees fulltime and parttime equivalent on the maximum shift that is the work shift in which the maximum number of employees are present 5 seatseat design capacity if the independent variable is seat the number of parking spaces is based on the number of seats that are provided to guests patrons members etc if the independent variable is seat design capacity the number of parking spaces is based on the maximum seating capacity of the use as established by applicable fire code 6 maximum capacity if the independent variable is maximum capacity the number of parking spaces is based on the lesser of a the maximum number of people who may occupy the use pursuant to applicable

a generally in locations where a mix of uses allows for synergy with respect to the utilization of parking spaces due to differences in the timing of peak parking demand the city may reduce the minimum required number of parking spaces according to the provisions of this section b shared parking table shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a subject property is occupied by two 2 or more uses that generally do not have peak parking demands at the same time when any land or building is used for two 2 or more categories of uses that are listed below the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures 1 multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals by the appropriate percentage listed in table 215207b1 shared parking table for each of the designated time periods 2 calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five 5 time periods each of the columns the minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums plus any reserved spaces that were excluded from the calculation in the first

denying the conditional use permit unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the complaints d if the use is nonresidential it is licensed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the city e the use has been maintained in good condition and its classification as a nonconforming use would be a disincentive for such maintenance d conditions conditions may be imposed

 findings objectives and intent division 101  findings objectives and intent regarding specific uses findings objectives and legislative intent regarding sexuallyoriented business a findings the regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in this udc are based on the following findings of the city council 1 sexuallyoriented businesses cause adverse secondary effects which are recognized by the us supreme court in cases such as young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 fwpbs inc v city of dallas 493 us 215 1990 and the 10 th circuit court of appeals in cases such as doctor johns v g blake wahlen 542 f3d 787 10 th cir 2008 as impacting substantial governmental interests in health safety and welfare 2 in city of erie v paps am 120 s ct 1382 2000 the us supreme court held that a city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities to demonstrate the problem of secondary effects so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses 3 other cases such as city of littleton v zj gifts 541 us 774 2004 barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 essence inc v city of federal heights 285 f3d 1272 10th cir 2002 zj gifts d2 llc v city of aurora 136 f3d 683 10th cir 1998 oconnor v city and county of

federal heights 625 p2d 982 colo 1981 have upheld reasonable regulations of sexuallyoriented businesses 4 the negative secondary impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses have been studied in other communities these communities include but are not limited to adams county colorado  dallas texas  denver colorado  ellicottville new york  garden grove california  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  islip new york  las vegas nevada  los angeles california  louisville kentucky  new york new york  oklahoma city oklahoma  phoenix arizona  rome city georgia  st paul minnesota  tucson arizona  and whittier california 5 the american center for law and justice also completed a study on the secondary effects of such uses dated march 1996 6 secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses may include any or all of the following material effects on the health safety and welfare of city residents a particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other sexuallyoriented businesses are an indicia of urban blight or a factor that downgrades the quality of life in the adjacent area  b sexuallyoriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas as they are regularly correlated to an increase in crime and a decrease in property values  c sexuallyoriented businesses commonly require special supervision from public safety agencies in order to protect public health safety and welfare including that of the patrons of such businesses  d studies and experience show that in the absence of regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses significant criminal activity including prostitution narcotics and liquor law violations have historically and regularly occurred within and within the immediate vicinity of such businesses  e sexuallyoriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature and the concern over sexually transmitted diseases including hiv is a legitimate health concern of the city  f sexuallyoriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often not controlled by the operators of the establishments  and g children and minors may be harmed by exposure to the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses including those encountered when children walk visit in the immediate neighborhood of such businesses b objectives the city wishes to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  deter the spread of urban blight  and protect residents and property owners from increased crime c intent it is not the intent of this suppress any speech protected by the first amendment but to enact reasonable contentneutral regulations that address the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses to this end the regulations in this apply specifically to sexuallyoriented businesses impose restrictions which are no greater than necessary to further the citys substantial interest in preventing adverse secondary effects attributable to such businesses  1 12617 findings regarding regulation of marijuana uses and marijuana cultivation a generally the findings of this section support the policy that is articulated in section 214 statement of policy regarding marijuana uses and marijuana cultivation b findings the city council finds that as of the effective date of this udc 1 marijuana is a controlled substance under federal law and possession of marijuana is prohibited by federal law 2 the voters of the state of

possession and sale of marijuana is illegal under federal law see 21 usc  841 et seq violators of us subject to criminal and civil penalties under federal law 6 the united states department of justice us doj issued a memorandum on  regarding us doj policy on enforcement of the federal controlled substances act in states that allow medical marijuana under state law in that memorandum deputy attorney general david ogden writes in pertinent part a of course no state can authorize violations of federal law  accordingly in prosecutions under the controlled substances act federal prosecutors are not expected to charge prove or otherwise establish any state law violations b this guidance regarding resource allocation does not legalize marijuana or provide a legal defense to a violation of federal law nor is it intended to create any privileges benefits or rights substantive or procedural enforceable by any individual party or witness in any administrative civil or criminal matter c nor does clear and unambiguous compliance with state law  create a legal defense to a violation of the controlled substances act 7 in response to the reallocation of investigative and prosecutorial resources of the us doj medical and recreational marijuana uses have proliferated in colorado 8 on  a white house official signaled that there will be greater enforcement of federal laws against marijuana use particularly in the area of recreational marijuana  however as of the effective date neither the white house nor the us doj has articulated a substantive change in policy  1 12617 division 102  findings regarding regulation of certain structures interests findings and legislative intent regarding sign regulation a statement of interests the city has the following legitimate important substantial or compelling interests in regulating signs 1 preventing the proliferation of signs of generally increasing size dimensions and intrusiveness also known as sign clutter that tends to result from competition for the attention of passing motorists and pedestrians because sign clutter a creates visual distraction and obstructs views potentially creating safety hazards for motorists bicyclists and pedestrians  b may involve physical obstruction of streets sidewalks or trails creating public safety hazards  c degrades the aesthetic quality of the city making the city a less attractive place for residents business owners visitors and private investment  d increases the cost of doing business in the city by placing undue pressure on business owners to invest in everincreasing amounts of signage  and e dilutes or obscures messages on individual signs due to the increasing intensity of competition for attention 2 maintaining and enhancing the historic character of downtown alamosa 3 protecting the health of the tree canopy in the city 4 maintaining a high quality aesthetic environment to protect and enhance property values leverage public investments in streets sidewalks trails plazas parks and landscaping and enhance community pride 5 protecting minors from speech that is harmful to them as provided by state or federal law by preventing such speech in places that are accessible to and used by minors b findings the city finds that 1 contentneutrality viewpoint neutrality and fundamental fairness in regulation and review are essential to ensuring an appropriate balance between the important substantial and compelling interests set out above and the constitutionallyprotected right to free expression 2 the sign regulations set out in this unrelated to the suppression of constitutionallyprotected free expression do not relate to the content of protected messages that may be displayed on signs and do not relate to the viewpoint of individual speakers 3 the incidental restriction on the freedom of speech that may result from the regulation of signs pursuant to this no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the important substantial and compelling interests that are advanced herein 4 regulation of the location number materials height sign area form and duration of display of temporary signs is essential to preventing sign clutter 5 temporary signs may be degraded damaged moved or destroyed by wind rain snow ice and sun and after such degradation damage movement or destruction such signs harm the safety and aesthetics of the citys streets if they are not removed 6 certain classifications of speech are not constitutionally protected due to the harm that they cause to individuals or the community c intent the sign regulations in this the citys best effort to advance its legitimate important substantial and compelling interests while ensuring consistency with an evolving legal framework  1 12617 interests findings and legislative intent regarding wireless telecommunications facilities regulations a interests the unique and diverse landscapes of the city are among its most valuable assets protecting these assets will require that location and design of wireless telecommunication services andor equipment be sensitive to and in scale and harmony with the character of the community b findings the city finds that providing predictable consistent and balanced standards for the siting and screening of wireless telecommunication services facilities and equipment is

possible extend to all people in all areas of the city high quality wireless telecommunication services at reasonable costs  and 3 encourage colocation and clustering of antenna sites and structures when practical to help reduce the number of such facilities that may be required in the future to service the needs of customers and thus avert unnecessary proliferation of facilities on private and
