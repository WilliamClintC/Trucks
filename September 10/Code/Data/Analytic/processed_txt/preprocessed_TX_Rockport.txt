the existing rockport wastewater treatment plant wwtp will have a rated average daily capacity of 25 million gallons per day mgd after the 1999 improvements are completed the plant has been expanded and upgraded over the last 15 years to provide treatment capabilities to meet the citys needs improve safety and efficiency of operation and to meet the texas natural resources conversation commissions tnrcc and us environmental protection agencys everchanging regulatory standards the rockport wwtp total average daily flow capacity prior to the present expansion was 157 mgd the level of current usage is an average wastewater flow of 12 mgd with the completion of construction in late 1999 the plant total average daily flow capacity will be 25 mgd present tnrcc standards require that the owner must initiate engineering and financial planning for expansion when the flow rate reaches 75 percent of the average daily flow for three consecutive months and begin construction of the expansion when the flow rate reaches 90 percent of the average daily flow this means there is a reserve capacity of  mgd until the flow rate reaches 75 percent of the plant capacity and the city has to begin planning for the next expansion demand of new service units over the next ten years will utilize a portion of the existing reserve capacity constructed there have been five construction projects performed at the rockport wwtp over the last 15 years these projects were undertaken to provide the necessary flow capacity to meet the needs of the city and to meet the periodically updated

adjoining property owners as set forth herein the adjoining properties to the street must bear an equitable share of the total project cost in accordance with texas law when value has been added to the adjoining property an equitable assessment should be made to each property on both sides of the improvement b1 unless determined to be inequitable all assessments will be developed and
