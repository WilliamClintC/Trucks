features and soil vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation various types of constructed facilities such as diversions settling basins skimming devices dikes waterways and ponds may be used preference shall be given to designs using surface drainage vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities scott county stormwater management zoning erosion control and wetlands b stormwater rate control the resource management plan shall include the design of all stormwater

percent of the site is covered by impervious surface or when the rate control provisions of paragraphs 3b and 3c of the rule as applicable are met  and the proposed activity development or redevelopment does not increase runoff volume for the 2 year critical duration event not including snow melt to demonstrate that the proposed activity does not accelerate on or offsite erosion downstream nuisance flooding or damage the applicant must complete an evaluation downstream to the point where the proposed activity is 10 percent of the drainage area eg a 10 acre development must evaluate downstream to the point where the drainage area is 100 acres the evaluation at a minimum must consist of an assessment of 2 potential impacts to areas surrounding landlocked lakes or ponds or lakes or ponds with inadequate outlets where flood levels would be increased by added runoff volume the evaluation must include a an assessment of water levels in the water body resulting from the contributing watersheds full annual runoff yield during a 100year wet year using the simplified hydrologic yield method shym or more rigorous methods for back to back 100year critical events for both

chapter 81 pud planned unit development district 811 purpose and intent the purpose of the planned unit development pud overlay zoning district is to provide a comprehensive procedure intended to allow greater flexibility and creativity in cluster residential and nonresidential development than would be possible under a conventional zoning district the pud may be used to encourage residential commercial and industrial development which satisfies the following objectives 1 variety within a comprehensive site design concept a pud can provide for a diversity of lot sizes mix of land uses housing choices and residential development densities to accommodate a variety of ages and income groups 2 efficiency in areas guided by the comprehensive plan a pud can preserve contiguous natural resource areas and open space to protect environmentally sensitive areas and provide scenic enjoyment recreational use agricultural production rural identity andor to retain land for efficient future development when appropriate infrastructure is available to support additional growth 3 sensitivity by departing from the strict application of required setbacks yard areas lot sizes street widths minimum requirements and other performance standards associated with conventional zoning a pud can maximize the development potential of land while remaining sensitive to its unique and valuable natural and cultural characteristics 4 integration through physical integration of neighborhoods open spaces and places of destination a pud can create attractive livable neighborhoods and avoid future urbanrural land use conflicts 5 value providing a more flexible approach a pud can be used to encourage the private sector into a collaborative development track that includes density bonuses in exchange for public values that promote varied housing options improve public infrastructure systems and encourage natural resource protection 6 vision with regards to rural development natural
