provided a written statement of the development fee schedule applicable to the development as of the date of the request ctiming of payment except as otherwise provided in this article development fees shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued and shall be calculated based on the fees in effect at the time the building permit is issued and pursuant to dadjustments development fees shall be adjusted and additional fees collected under the following circumstances 1if at any time during the construction of the building or structure or following the completion of a building or structure city staff or its agents determines that the information upon which development fees were originally calculated is not consistent with the actual construction the development fees shall be recalculated to reflect the actual development units regardless of whether an amended application is submitted any additional development fees owed pursuant to the recalculation shall be paid prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 2if city staff or its agents learns that an entire structure or a portion of the structure will be occupied by an occupancy that is inconsistent with the category of development upon which development fees were originally calculated the development fees shall be recalculated to reflect the appropriate category of development at the time of occupancy any additional development fees owed shall be paid upon discovery of city staff of the change in occupancy but no later than upon an application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy related to the occupancy by way of example if development fees on a building were calculated based on the assumption that an entire structure with 50000 square feet of gross floor area would be occupied as a professional office but a certificate of occupancy was sought for a portion of the building consisting of 25000 square feet of gross floor area for occupancy as a retail establishment additional development fees would be owed based on the difference between the development fees owed for the building of which 25000 square feet of gfa is used for commercial and 25000 square feet of gfa is used for office and other services and the development fees owed for the building of which 50000 square feet of gfa is used for office and other services 3except as otherwise provided in a development agreement approved by the governing body no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all development fees have been paid including additional development fees resulting from adjustments made pursuant to this subsection d ecalculations except in cases of special fee determinations which are discussed in subsection f of this section development fees shall be calculated by multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the number of development units except as otherwise provided in development fees shall be calculated using the development fees in effect at the time the fees are being collected the following are examples of how development fees shall be calculated under various scenarios 1for new buildings or structures development fees shall be calculated by multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the number of development units for example the development fees for a commercial development in north goodyear consisting of 21465 square feet of gross floor area gfa with one twoinch water meter would be calculated as follows dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable service area number of development units fee owed police commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $429 2146 21465  1000 $9206 2146 x $429 fire commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $467 2146 21465  1000 $10022 2146 x $467 streets commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $3621 2146 21465  1000 $77707 2146 x $3621 parks commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $29 2146 21465  1000 $622 2146 x $29 water commercial meter size  2 $40257 1 $40257 1 x $40257 wastewater commercial meter size  2 $15019 1 $15019 1 x $15019 2for a new building or structure in which multiple categories of development are to be located development fees shall be calculated by multiplying the adopted development fees for the applicable service area by the number of development units for each category of development that will be located within the building or structure as set forth above and then adding the fees for all of the categories of development together for example the streets development fee for a building located in south goodyear that will include 30000 square feet of gross floor area gfa that will be occupied by commercial businesses 10000 square feet of gfa that will be occupied as professional offices and 50 dwelling units would be calculated as follows dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable service area number of development units fee owed streets commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $4517 30 30000  1000 $135510 30 x $4517 streets office per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $2119 10 10000  1000 $21190 10 x $2119 streets residential 2+ units per dwelling unit $2582 50 $129100 50 x $2582 total  street     $285800 3for modifications to existing structures that increase the square footage of structure development fees shall be calculated based on multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the number of additional development units resulting from the expansion for example if an existing commercial facility in north goodyear is being expanded to add another 10353 square feet of gross floor area with no change in water meters the additional development fees for the additional area would be calculated as follows dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable service area number of development units fee owed police commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $429 1035 10353  1000 $4440 1035 x $429 fire commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $467 1035 10353  1000 $4833 1035 x $467 streets commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $3621 1035 10353  1000 $37477 1035 x $3621 parks commercial per 1000 sq feet  of gfa $29 1035 10353  1000 $300 1035 x $29 4for modifications to existing structures that result in the addition of new utility meters utility development fees shall be calculated based on multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the new development units being added the development fee calculations shall be based on the development fees in effect at the time of the modification for example if an existing commercial facility in south goodyear had a oneinch water meter and because of modifications to the facilities needed to accommodate additional service demands two new oneinch water meters were being installed the additional water development fee would be calculated as follows dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable service area number of development units fee owed water commercial meter size  1 $13097 2 $26194 2 x $13097 if the additional water meters to be installed would result in water being discharged to the citys wastewater system additional wastewater development fees would also be due and calculated in a manner similar to the water meter calculation above 5for modifications to existing structures that result in a change in the size of utility meters the additional development fees owed as a result of this change shall be calculated based on multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the current development unit resulting from the modification and then subtracting the development fees calculated based on multiplying the adopted development fee for the applicable category of development for the applicable service area by the prior development unit the development fee calculations shall be based on the development fees in effect at the time of the modification for example if an existing commercial facility in north goodyear had a oneinch water meter for which the development fee is being modified to replace the oneinch water meter with a twoinch meter the additional water development fee would be calculated as follows dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable service area number of development units fee owed water commercial meter size  2 $40257 1 $40257 1 x $40257 water commercial meter size  1 $12613 1 $12613 1 x $12613 additional fees     $27644 $40257  $12613 if the additional water meters to be installed would result in water being discharged to the citys wastewater system additional wastewater development fees would also be due and calculated in a manner similar to the water meter calculation above fspecial fee determination in situations in which a development is of a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development or in which a development has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated with providing necessary public services to that development will differ substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified category of development the city may allow or may require the applicant to provide the finance director with an alternative development fee analysis based on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with the development the alternative development fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development based on appropriate service units and applicable cost per service unit or may propose that the development be covered under the development fee schedule governing a different and more analogous category of development the finance director shall review the alternative development fee analysis and shall make a determination as to the development fee to be charged such decision shall be appealable pursuant to the finance director may require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application including the costs of any qualified professionals passed 1142019 9810 credits acredits subject to the provisions of this

expands a wastewater facility to provide wastewater services to new development in the portion of south goodyear identified as a service area for wastewater development fees credits for the cost of the facility expansion may only be applied against wastewater development fees in the south goodyear wastewater service area 2credits may only be applied to development located within the same service area for which the development fee being credited is collected by way of example if a developer is entitled to a credit for the costs of constructing a capital facility that is identified in an infrastructure improvements plan as being necessary to provide water services to north goodyear and it is included in the water development fee for the service area north goodyear the credits provided may only be applied toward water development fees for the service area north goodyear 3credits shall be applied only to that portion of the applicable development fee attributable to the capital facility for which the credits are provided by way of example if a developer constructs a capital facility that is included in an adopted iip for which a wastewater development fee is assessed and the costs of the capital facility in the iip represents 10% of the total costs of all capital facilities included in the iip the amount of the credit that can be applied towards a wastewater development fee will be 10% of the applicable wastewater development fee thus if the wastewater development fee for a building in the north goodyear service area was $15019 calculated based on one twoinch meter the amount of the credit that could be applied towards the wastewater development fee is $1502 dev fee category of development development unit development fee per development unit for applicable

available for reallocation assuming the following facts i the developer constructed an eligible capital facility and entered into a credit agreement that provided $1000000 in total available credits  iithe developer previously reallocated $500000 of the available credits to another property  and iii as of the effective date of the proposed amendment $200000 of credits had been applied towards development fees for development within the property identified in the credit agreement the developer property would be $300000 calculated as follows $1000000  $500000  $200000   $300000 3a

violation user violations of monitoring reporting and treatment requirements may range from relatively minor violations eg report submitted a week late but having no effluent violations to significant violations each instance of noncompliance is a separate violation which will be reviewed and appropriately addressed btypes of violation include but are not limited to the following 1random violation means any violation that exceeds a federal arizona or local discharge limitation or compliance schedule random violations may include the first second or third offense and may not be severe or frequent enough to be classified as a significant violation or a pattern violation 2pattern violation means any series of random violations four or more that is not severe or frequent enough to be classified as a significant violation but which contribute to a pattern of noncompliance when viewed over a moving 12month period four random violations occurring during a moving 12month period would constitute a pattern violation 3significant noncompliance snc violation means any violation which by its impact severity or frequency of occurrence presents a hazard or nuisance to the potw general public or the environment a user is considered to be in significant noncompliance if one or more of the following has occurred in the previous 12 months achronic violations of wastewater discharge limits defined here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken during a sixmonth period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter  btechnical review criteria trc violations which means 33% or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a sixmonth period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria to determine exceedance value for biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss oil and grease is 14 value for

discretion determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program passed 332014 12a83 determining enforcement response athe appropriate enforcement response for violations and noncompliance with wastewater discharge city requirement will depend upon the severity and duration of the violation compliance history good faith efforts of the user to comply harm caused by the violation and whether the noncompliance resulted in a violation of the city potw permits bthe following sections describe factors that are evaluated as part of the process to determine the appropriate level of enforcement response 1severity and duration of violation the city will evaluate the duration of the violation to determine the possible effects that may have occurred in the potw the assessment of each specific violation should take into account the volume and strength or concentration of the discharge depending on the severity even an isolated violation could threaten public health and the environment damage public and private property or threaten the operational integrity of the potw 2compliance history of user the compliance history of the facility is reviewed prior to selecting the appropriate level of enforcement response more aggressive enforcement actions will be taken when a facility has frequent violations also considered is the effectiveness of previous enforcement actions 3good faith effort of user the city will consider the actions of the user before and after a noncompliance incident on a casebycase basis to assess whether the user is acting in good faith 4harm caused by violation violations that have negative impacts to the potw are typically considered significant for example violations may result in significant increases in treatment costs  interfere with operations  harm potw personnel or equipment cause exceedances of the potw permit limitations that result in fines from federal or arizona agencies or cause sludge contamination resulting in increased disposal costs these violations may result in an administrative fine or civil fine and an administrative order to correct the violation in addition to recovery of costs 5noncompliance discharge the noncompliance that causes interference or passthe potw and results in a city permit violation will be addressed with formal enforcement actions and fines in order to ensure that adequate pretreatment and discharge compliance is achieved promptly enforcement actions may include injunctive measures in appropriate cases passed 332014 12a84 enforcement actions adetermination of the appropriate enforcement response to noncompliance will vary based on the type nature and severity of the violation as provided in the enforcement response table each act and each day of noncompliance will constitute a separate violation once noncompliance is determined the city will provide notice of the violations to the user the type of notification will vary depending on the severity of the violation bthe city may take the enforcement action determined appropriate by the city the enforcement response table is a guidelines and in no way is intended to limit the citys ability to pursue any and all action it deems appropriate and warranted based on the allegations and in whatever order is determined to be appropriate 1inspection and monitoring when permit or discharge violations occur the city may perform an inspection of the facility to assess if the violation has been corrected and if the facility is operating normally inspections are typically not scheduled ahead of time the user must allow the city access to the facility for sampling and inspection purposes within a reasonable timeframe from inspection notification awhen the results of the users selfmonitoring as required by the users permit indicate that a violation has occurred the user is required to repeat the sampling and analysis for the parameter in violation the resampling must consist of a minimum of four consecutive days of monitoring with flow and discharge conditions consistent with the facilitys industrial wastewater discharge permit the analytical results of the resampling must be submitted to the city within 30 days of the user becoming aware of the violation 2informal notification averbal warning notice may be given for minor violations and involves the city notifying the user that a violations has occurred identifies the required corrective actions and the time frame in which the corrective actions must be completed the city may also schedule additional inspections andor sampling andor any other action deemed appropriate by the city bwritten warning notice may be given in writing for minor or moderate violations and involves the city

nature of variances athe variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city of goodyear to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate
