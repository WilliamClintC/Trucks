developments and expansions of existing developments can have a significant impact on the transportation system particularly if adequate planning and consideration of system improvements are not addressed in order to ensure that a highway system can satisfactorily accommodate a proposed development b a traffic impact study tis may be required to analyze relevant impact issues a tis is a comprehensive study that analyzes all surface transportation modes that would be affected by a development including pedestrians bicycles and public transportation services the impact analysis area will generally be larger than just the immediate site c the tis concludes whether any transportation improvements are necessary to accommodate new andor future traffic volumes generated by the proposed development or general growth of background traffic volumes these improvements could include right turn lanes left turn lanes additional acceleration lanes bicycle lanes bus stops sidewalks islands medians access control traffic signals removal andor consolidation of existing approaches etc d the tis documents the extent of the impact of the proposed development on the highway system including trips added resulting levels of service during weekday am pm and saturday when necessary peaks and the need for auxiliary lanes or other special capacity or safety features required changes in traffic control land use access pedestrian or bicycle usage must also be documented e additionally any changes effecting safety or traffic operations on the township or state highway system including but not limited to striping channelization medians islands signalization andor changes in access shall be documented by the developer to show that all adjacent andor affected property owners and businesses have been contacted and the impacts to their property has been discussed a list of the names and addresses of all adjacent andor affected property owners and businesses that were contacted shall be included with the tis 2 when required a a tis shall be required with the submission of a new site plan preliminary subdivision plan for a new or expanded existing development or an official zoning district map application the tis shall be submitted when the following are exceeded 1 residential developments in excess of 20 dwelling units 2 nonresidential projects in excess of

square footage by 5000 square feet or more if no traffic impact study has been approved for the use in the fiveyear period preceding the application for expansion d in addition a traffic impact study shall be prepared whenever either one of the following conditions exist within the traffic impact study area 1 current safety or congestion problems exist in the local area such as highaccident locations confusing intersections or a congested intersections which affects access to the development 2 the capacity of the existing roadway system to handle increased traffic volume or the ability to improve the roadway system to handle increased traffic is limited 3 impact analysis area a there are several thresholds that must be analyzed to determine the scope of study area for each project the thresholds are based on the number of trips to be generated in a twentyfourhour period which are referred to as average daily traffic volumes adt in any event the applicant shall contact the township to obtain concurrence for the level of study 1 level i 0200 adt include each access point to the development including public streetsroadways joint permanent easements and private driveways a level i study is generally required for larger residential subdivisions small office developments or smaller commercial developments 2 level ii 2013000 adtlevel ii 2003000 adt include each access point to the development including public streets roadways joint permanent easements and private driveways in addition the study shall include the first major intersection beyond each site point of access major intersections are intersections controlled by traffic signals or stop signs and could include driveways if there are no nearby major intersections township staff will determine the extent of the study area if a freeway interchange is nearby the project site to be developed it shall be included in the study this level of study is commonly required for moderately sized commercial developments and larger office complexes  22410 foreword  22410 fwd543 3 level iii more than 3000 adt level iii studies shall include each access point to the development including public streets roadways joint permanent easements and private driveways in addition the study area shall include at least the first major intersection beyond each site point of access and any intersection beyond that that will increase by 100 or more peak directional trips generated by the development in any event the exact area to be studied shall be determined by township staff with input from the preparer of the study level iii studies are usually warranted only with very large mixedused and commercial developments 4 who should prepare transportation impact study traffic impact studies shall be
