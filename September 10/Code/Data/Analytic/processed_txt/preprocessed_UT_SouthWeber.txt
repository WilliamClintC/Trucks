following fees were calculated aexplanation it is assumed that a brand new road has a design life of approximately fifteen 15 years meaning that if new pavement is installed receives the proper maintenance crack seal seal coats etc and is not cut or compromised in any way it will last approximately fifteen 15 years before another overlay is needed if the road is cut however the design life of the road is compromised the road is now more susceptible to water getting underneath the asphalt this allows damage to the road due to freezethaw situations as well as degradation of the base and possibly subbase material the square footage of the excavation site restoration is measured to be the impact on the road the age of the road being cut has also been considered if the road is less than two 2 years old the design life is shortened more than if the road is older than two 2 years old for the purpose of calculating the fee the following assumptions have been made if a road that is less than two 2 years old is cut the design life has been shortened by approximately six 6 years or 40 percent  if a road that is older than two 2 years old is cut the design life has been shortened by approximately four 4 years or 25 percent also even though potholes have minimal square footage the impact on the road is still the same therefore in order to adequately compensate for the diminished road integrity of the road the fee is the same for all small excavations of one hundred 100 square feet or less the following equations represent how the fees are being calculated the following

the following findings regarding storm water runoff and the citys storm sewer system athe citys existing storm sewer system consists of a network of manmade and natural facilities structures and conduits including ground water and aquifers that collect and route storm water runoff bthe citys existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the storm water runoff generated in the city cthe citys anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate storm sewer system duncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff endangers the citys ground water supply euncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff causes erosion and property damage funcontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff hinders the citys ability to provide emergency services to its residents guncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city huncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff poses health hazards to the citizens of the community istorm water runoff carries concentrations of oil grease nutrients chemicals heavy metals toxic materials and other undesirable materials that may jeopardize the integrity of ground waters and receiving waters including the citys culinary water supply jall developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces kall developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the citys operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system lthe state department of environmental quality deq has determined that some of the citys storm water sumps must be included on the prioritized contamination sources for culinary wells mthe epa and the deq are developing additional storm water permitting requirements that will apply to cities nabsent effective maintenance operation regulation and control existing storm water drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential hazard to the health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and its businesses oa storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing storm water in the city and ensuring that each property in the city pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer system  852 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to protect the health safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the citys storm sewer system managing and controlling storm water runoff protecting property preventing polluted waters from entering the citys water supply and other receiving waters and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system  853 definitions the following words and phrases shall be defined as follows developed parcel any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition by grading filling or the construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces equivalent residential unit eru the average amount of impervious surface expressed in square feet on developed singlefamily residential parcels in south weber one eru equals two thousand eight hundred 2800 square feet of impervious surface area impervious surface any hard surface other than the natural surface that prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at greater rates of flow than the natural surface  854 creation and operation acreation the city council hereby creates and establishes a storm sewer utility as part of the citys overall sewer system the storm sewer utility shall plan design construct maintain administer and operate the citys storm sewer system benterprise fund the city council hereby establishes a storm sewer utility enterprise fund to handle all income expenses and other financial transactions related to the storm sewer utility all storm sewer utility service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund money in the storm sewer utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other city funds however the storm sewer utility may pay other city funds for services and expenses directly attributable to the storm sewer utility the enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy cfacilities and assets the storm sewer utility shall operate independently of city operations funded by the general fund the storm sewer utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities such as the water utility and the sanitary sewer wastewater utility upon creation of the utility all of the citys storm sewer facilities and assets other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city manager shall be transferred to the storm sewer utility in consideration for the storm sewer utilitys agreement to take primary responsibility for planning designing constructing maintaining administering and operating the citys storm sewer system dadministration the storm sewer utility shall be administered by the citys public works director  855 fee aimposed each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be charged a storm sewer utility fee beru the fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential units erus contained in the parcel the city council finds that the eru is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility based on a study completed by an independent engineer the city council finds and establishes that one eru equals two thousand eight hundred 2800 square feet of impervious surface area ccalculation the city council finds that each singlefamily residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff  therefore each developed singlefamily residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one eru all nonsinglefamily residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate expressed in erus according to the measured impervious area on the parcel the city council may adopt separate rates for prds condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule dcharge per eru the amount charged for each eru shall be established by resolution of the city council eexemptions and credits the city council may establish exemptions and credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution fpolicies the public works director may adopt policies consistent with this chapter and any resolutions passed by the city council to assist in the application administration and interpretation of this chapter and any resolutions related to the storm sewer utility gappeals any person or entity that believes that this chapter or any storm sewer utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal to the public works director director the appeal shall be in writing shall state any facts supporting the appeal and shall be made within ten 10 days of the decision action or bill being appealed the director may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal the director shall decide the appeal within ten 10 days of when the appeal is filed if the person or entity is not satisfied with the directors decision a further appeal may be made to the city manager or his or her designee the appeal to the city manager shall follow the same procedure as the appeal to the director the city managers decision shall be final and binding on all parties  856 billing the city council finds that the citys storm sewer system sanitary sewer system culinary water system and solid waste collection system are interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible manner therefore the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on the citys regular monthly utility bill for any given property if there is no regular utility bill for the property the storm sewer utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property the fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property all properties shall be charged the fee regardless of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property requests the storm sewer utility service failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water service  chapter 6 storm drainage  definitions 862 prohibited obstructions 863 prohibited discharges 864 prohibited storage and littering 865 storm sewer
