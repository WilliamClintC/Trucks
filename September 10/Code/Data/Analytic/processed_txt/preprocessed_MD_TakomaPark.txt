satisfies the species quality shade potential and other characteristics of the tree to be replaced no credits shall be allowed for a preplanted tree that is dead in significant decline or structurally unsound 3when a property owner has made an advance contribution to the tree planting fund the tree planted will be presumed to be alive structurally sound and healthy at the time the property owner seeks to utilize the credit and will be presumed to be of the highest species quality and shade potential and to possess all necessary characteristics to replace any tree that the property owner seeks to remove 4no single preplanted tree may be used to satisfy the replacement requirements for more than one urban forest tree removed by the property owner regardless of whether the preplanted trees imputed basal area exceeds the departments calculation of the tree replacement requirements for the tree to be removed however the aggregate basal area of multiple preplanted trees can be used to satisfy the replacement requirement for a single tree to be removed 5registered preplanting tree replacement credits convey with the property and may be used by subsequent owners of the property

one of the following classes 1singlefamily residential property  or 2other developed property bsinglefamily residential fee the council finds that the intensity of development of most parcels of real property in the city classified as singlefamily residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the improvements such as buildings structures and other impervious area on each such parcel therefore all singlefamily residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat stormwater management fee equal to the base rate regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements cother developed property fee 1the fee for other developed property ie nonsinglefamily residential property in the city shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious surface area square feet of the property by one base unit the impervious surface area for other developed property is the square footage for the buildings and other improvements on the property as listed in the state assessment roll alternatively at the sole discretion of the city manager when evidence suggests that the impervious surface on the property listed in the state assessment roll is inaccurate the impervious surface area of other developed property may be determined examination mapping information aerial photographs and other available information the minimum stormwater management fee for other developed property shall equal the base rate for singlefamily residential property 2if the other developed property is a condominium the fee for each condominium unit will be calculated by dividing the total fee for the condominium property by the number of condominium units in the development

onsite forest retention must equal 25% of the net tract area bin a planned development or a site development using a cluster or other optional method of development in a onefamily residential zone onsite forest retention must equal the applicable conservation threshold in subsection a this requirement also applies to any site seeking a waiver or variance from base zone standards under d 6d 7c

forest is less than the applicable afforestation threshold in subsection a the afforestation threshold is the minimum onsite forest requirement dif a site covered by this subsection is unforested onsite afforestation must equal the applicable afforestation threshold 3if the planning board or planning director as appropriate finds that forest retention required in this subsection is not

providing a full range of housing choices for all incomes ages and household sizes  2meet the existing and anticipated need for low and moderateincome housing  3ensure that moderately priced housing is dispersed throughout the county consistent with the general plan and area master plans  and 4encourage the construction of moderately priced housing by allowing optional increases in density including the mpdu density bonus to offset the cost of construction bin 200 the county council amended the mpdu program to 1reduce the loss of mpdus by extending the control period for forsale mpdus from 10 years to 30 years and for rental mpdus from 20 years to 99 years  2allow different income eligibility standards in recognition of the higher cost of construction of certain types of housing  3increase the number of developments required to provide mpdus by lowering the base requirement from any development with 35 or more units to 20 or more units  and 4place additional requirements and structure on the approval of an alternative payment made to the housing initiative fund in place of providing mpdus cin 201 the county council finds that 1the availability of affordable housing continues to be a problem for low and moderateincome households 2the 2015 report the greater washington regions housing needs 2023 projects that montgomery county will need 14960 new housing units for households earning less than 80% of area median income 3the 2017 montgomery county rental housing study reports that 68% of households with incomes between 50% and 80% of area median income report paying more than 30% of income for rent and 15% report being extremely rent burdened paying more than 50% of income for rent 4the creation of incomerestricted affordable housing preservation is critical as market rents continue to increase the american community survey reports that there were 9189 fewer rental units with rents between $750 and $1499 from 2010 to 2014 5mpdus are one important element for providing incomerestricted affordable housing there were 664 new mpdus offered for sale or rent in 2015 and 2016 as of 2017 there are about 5300 mpdus countywide 6additional density can offset the cost of constructing mpdus it is appropriate to consider different base requirements for mpdus in conjunction with the approval of different densities and heights in master plans and sector plans 7there is unmet demand for mpdus with two three and four bedrooms providing flexibility that allows mpdu agreements based on floor area or square footage rather than requirements based on the number of bedrooms in market rate units can help to address this need 8appropriate alternative payments to the housing initiative fund can in certain circumstances be used to create more mpdus in the same planning area than providing the mpdus on site 9montgomery county is committed to its policy of providing affordable housing in all areas of the county to provide opportunity to households of all incomes in each planning area 10mpdus can be used in partnership with other housing supports to provide affordable housing to households with very low incomes such as those with incomes below 50% or 30% of area median income 1974 lmc ch 17  1  1979 lmc ch 21  1  1989 lmc ch 27  1  2018 lmc ch 20  1 declaration of public policy the county council hereby declares it to be the public policy of the

moderate and lowincome households has become more severe since 197 when housing moderately priced was adopted even though the private sector the county government the housing opportunities commission and nonprofit sponsors of housing projects have made substantial progress in financing and constructing affordable homes and in the full use of federal and state programs there remains a severe shortage of homes that are within the means of families of low and moderate incomes given economic trends and conditions projected year 200 land and construction costs inflation diminished federal tax incentives and high interest rates will increase rents to a level that will cause the problem to intensify particularly for newly formed households older people handicapped individuals those living in substandard housing those subject to discrimination and those with low or moderate incomes these trends and conditions if unabated will frustrate the countys goal of a full range of housing choices conveniently located throughout the county the county should devote special attention to the provision of assistedfamily housing and identify actions that the county may take to provide or stimulate production of additional units of assistedfamily housing crising costs when combined with the changes in the size and age of households in the county compel a higher priority than has heretofore been

director may approve a request to amend the validity period phasing schedule of an approved preliminary plan if the length of the total validity period of the preliminary plan is not extended the applicant must submit the request in writing before the previously established validity period of the phase expires cthe written request must detail all reasons to support the extension request and include the anticipated date by which the plan will be validated the applicant must certify that the requested extension is the minimum additional time required to record all plats for the preliminary plan 2effect of failure to submit a timely extension request athe failure to submit a written extension request in a timely fashion voids all nonvalidated portions of the preliminary plan and where applicable an approved site plan bwhere a preliminary plan has been allowed to expire due to the applicants failure to file a timely request for extension the board may reinstate the preliminary plan and establish a new validity period if practical difficulty or undue hardship is demonstrated by the applicant the board may require the applicant to get a new apfo review and approval by the board as a prerequisite or condition of its action to extend an expired plan 3grounds for extension athe board may only grant a request to extend the validity period of a preliminary plan if the board finds that idelays by the government or some other party after the plan approval have prevented the applicant from meeting terms or conditions of the plan approval and validating the plan provided such delays are not caused by the applicant  or iithe occurrence of significant unusual and unanticipated events beyond the applicants control and not caused by the applicant have substantially impaired the applicants ability to validate the plan and exceptional or undue hardship as evidenced in part by the efforts undertaken by the applicant to implement the terms and conditions of the plan approval in order to validate the plan would result to the applicant if the plan were not extended bthe applicant bears the burden of establishing the grounds in support of the requested extension 4planning board considerations for extension athe board may condition the grant of an extension on a requirement that the applicant revise the plan to conform with changes to the requirements of this the plan was approved bthe board may deny the extension request if it finds that the project as approved and conditioned is no longer viable the board must consider whether the project is capable of being financed constructed and marketed within a reasonable time frame the applicant must demonstrate the projects viability upon request by the board or the director 5planning board action aafter a duly noticed public hearing the board must determine whether it should grant a request for an extension the requirements for noticing and conducting a public hearing must follow the requirements for a preliminary plan bif voting to approve an extension the board must only grant the minimum time it deems necessary for the applicant to validate the plan cthe board may only grant an extension to a preliminary plan within the plans apfo validity period unless a further extension is allowed by law dan applicant may request and the board may approve more than one extension eonce a phasing schedule is approved by the board as part of a preliminary plan approval the board must treat any revision or alteration to the schedule other than an amendment approved under j7 as a minor amendment to the preliminary plan board approval of a revised phasing schedule is required to extend the total length of the validity period ieffect of failure to timely validate plan or secure an extension 1if a preliminary plan is not timely validated in whole or in part before the expiration of the validity period any remaining portion of the plan is void for multiphased plans the failure on the part of an applicant to timely validate a phase in whole or in part voids the balance of the preliminary plan approval for that phase and all subsequent nonvalidated phases 2in those instances where an applicant has timely validated only a portion of a plan and no extension is granted the applicant seeking to develop only that portion of the project remains responsible for fully complying with all of the terms conditions and other requirements associated with the portion of the plan approval that has been implemented 3if a preliminary plan or a phase of the plan is not timely validated any apfo determination made by the board associated with the void portion of the preliminary plan is also void in such event the applicant loses any further rights to claim any vehicle trips associated with the expired apfo approval the filing of a new preliminary plan application does not provide the basis for reclaiming vehicle trips lost by the termination of the apfo approval 4a preliminary plan approval conditionally linked to a sketch plan or project plan approval under expires if the sketch plan or project plan expires jrevocation of approval 1the board may revoke approval of a preliminary plan by resolution at any time before the board approves the final plat covering the proposed preliminary plan 2to revoke a preliminary plan approval except in response to a violation of this the board must find that completing a portion of the plan has been rendered impractical by reason of an amendment to the general plan or by a conflict with a proposed public improvement or other conditions or circumstances not previously considered by the board that make the plan contrary to public health safety or welfare 3the board must give a subdivider notice and an opportunity to be heard by the board before taking any action to revoke approval of a preliminary plan notice to the owner and subdivider must be sent by certified mail at least 30 days before the date of the proposed

council finds that it is in the public interest to offset the environmental impacts of development and address the loss of environmental resources including trees and potential growing space for shade trees and conserve tree canopy throughout the county trees and tree canopy constitute important environmental resources trees cleanse the air offset the heat island effects of urban development reduce energy needs and provide oxygen they improve the quality of life in communities by providing for a greater sense of wellbeing and increasing esthetic appeal and compatibility between different land uses trees filter groundwater reduce surface runoff and soil erosion help alleviate flooding and supply necessary habitat for a diversity of wildlife the council finds that the damage to or loss of environmental resources as a result of development and other land disturbing activities is a serious problem in the county and that establishing shade trees and tree canopy helps mitigate these losses and increase the diversity of species and age classes of trees the council finds that given the expected survival rate of newly planted shade trees at least 3 new shade trees should be planted to produce the canopy coverage of one mature shade tree bpurpose the purposes of this to 1save maintain and establish tree canopy for the benefit of county residents and future generations  and 2provide for mitigation when environmental resources including trees and potential growing space for shade trees are lost or disturbed as a result of development by establishing ashade tree planting
