will promote economic development within the town of griswold  iv whether the commission has received a review by the senior public safety official of the town of griswold indicating that the proposed deadend street makes adequate provision for access and circulation of emergency vehicles v whether the developer of the proposed deadend street demonstrates to the commission that there is a reasonable likelihood that the deadend street can in the future be extended to interconnect with another existing or proposed road or street  and in conjunction therewith the subdivider proposes the dedication of an access strip from the termination of the initial phase or phases of the subdivision and extends the deadend street to the subdivision property line in the final phase for the future road interconnection to the property line of the property being subdivided  and vi whether the horizontal and vertical geometry of the proposed deadend street is sufficient to comply with aashto minimum site line requirements for the proposed access intersection for each lot in the subdivision to the deadend street c in subdivisions of industrially or commercially zoned lots which contain deadend streets which exceed one thousand two hundred 1200 feet from a road with an alternative route of access the commission may require the applicant to provide an alternative means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles to lots within such subdivision and to reasonably improve any such required emergency access drive to facilitate access by such emergency vehicles to lots within such industrially or commercially zoned subdivision d in commercially or industrially zoned subdivisions with industrial andor commercial lots with deadend streets the commission may require that the applicant design and obtain approval of a continuation of such deadend street to a state or municipal road or street in situations in which i the applicant alone or in combination with other parties filing simultaneous subdivision applications controls the land required for such future interconnection and ii the commission deems such future interconnection prudent based upon the scope and intended uses of the commercially or industrially zoned subdivision where the applicant does not control the land required for such future interconnection the commission may require that the subdivision street be designed to the property line as described above and constructed in conjunction with the final phase of the land being subdivided e in the design of all culdesacs the subdivider shall dedicate an easement thirty 30 feet in width and twenty 20 feet in depth to the town of griswold at the terminus of the culdesac for snow storage as indicated on exhibit 53 3a which easement area shall be granted to the town of griswold contemporaneously with the conveyance of the deadend street to the municipality in addition no shrubbery irrigation system landscaping other than lawn area stone wall fence or other obstruction shall be placed in the area between the pavement edge and the street property line around the entire circumference of a culdesac and this restriction shall be noted on the record subdivision plan for such deadend streets f the commission shall have the discretion to require as a component of any subdivision application in which the proposed deadend street length exceeds one thousand two hundred 1200 feet a traffic study performed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of connecticut engaged in the discipline of traffic analysis determining that the roadway standards proposed in the subdivision application are sufficient to accommodate anticipated traffic generation and turning movements based upon the anticipated buildout of the commercial or industrial subdivision g in commercial andor industrial subdivisions the commission shall have the discretion to require street pavement widths for deadend streets greater than twentyeight 28 feet but not exceeding thirtyfour 34 feet based upon the intended street geometry trip generation and anticipated uses for the subdivision 16  the tangent distance between reverse curves shall not be less than fifty 50 feet except for intersections and turnarounds on deadend streets no curve shall have a radius of less than one hundred 100 feet as measured radial to the

proposed subdivision street intersects with a state highway or major town road a minimum sight distance of three hundred fifty 350 feet shall be required in each direction along the state highway or major town road 17  if authorized by statute whenever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade alignment width and construction set forth in these regulations or the road the town of griswold and the commission determines that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision as long as the road section within those limits is deemed directly impacted by the creation of the subdivision the commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street within those said impacted limits by and at the expense of the subdivider as long as it is reasonable and necessary to maintain the health and safety of the public or may disapprove such plan until the board of selectmen has authorized expenditures for such improvements    where such improvement from the centerline is impractical the commission may require if authorized by statute improvements of comparable value to be performed along the existing road frontage of the subdivision or adjacent frontage impacted by the subdivision in the alternative the commission may require that the cost of such improvements shall be paid to the board of selectmen or its designated agent in lieu of the completion of such improvements by the applicant such payment shall be held in a separate fund to be used exclusively for the improvement of the subject street in ways which directly benefit the future owners of lots in the subdivision    in making the determinations set forth in the preceding two paragraphs the commission shall take into account the streets ability to handle the increased volumes of traffic which will be generated by the proposed subdivision  the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely to serve the new lots in the subdivision in view of the additional traffic caused by the new subdivision the drainage conditions of the street and the impact of the new lots and related improvements on the existing stormwater management systems or the need for expansion or improvement of such systems  the impact of proposed driveways on the existing street including sight lines drainage impacts required grading and safe access  the projected pedestrian traffic from the lots and the anticipated pedestrian improvement between them  and generally

requirement that may be included in the municipal stormwater management plan and resulting ordinances the developer shall provide additional capacity in adjacent culverts and other drainage features for accommodating increased runoff from the proposed development should it be deemed necessary by the commission all existing and proposed drainage systems shall be indicated as to size and location

subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade alignment width and construction set forth in these regulations or the road the town of griswold and the commission determines that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision as long as the road section within those limits is deemed directly impacted by the creation of the subdivision the commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street within those said impacted limits by and at the expense of the subdivider as long as it is
