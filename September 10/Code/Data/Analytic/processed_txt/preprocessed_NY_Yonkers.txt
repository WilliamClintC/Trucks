381994 by go no 51994 1 having received a report from city planning staff concerning the proliferation of certain signs in the city of yonkers the city council of the city of yonkers hereby finds that the existence and proliferation of billboards and similar signs along the citys thoroughfares and on rooftops and sides of buildings has resulted in a visual blight that detracts from the appearance and orderliness of the city obscuring its vistas and its neighborhoods furthermore a number of signs are located near existing homes and apartment buildings lending an unsightly appearance to a number of the citys neighborhoods and undermining the quality of life of residents of those neighborhoods rooftop signs particularly undermine the aesthetic and architectural integrity of the cityscape 2 in addition signs are by their nature designed to attract attention and therefore signs placed within sight of roadways are intended to distract drivers as well as pedestrians flashing rotating and animated signs are by their nature particularly distracting therefore traffic safety can only be furthered by reasonable and appropriate limitations upon signs in the city of yonkers which includes a number of heavily traveled avenues and parkways 3 offsite signs with their periodically changing content present special aesthetic and traffic safety problems and commercial signs constitute the overwhelming proportion of all offsite signs in addition owners of businesses have a unique interest in advertising the activities on the premises of their businesses to which weight must be given similarly because noncommercial permanent signs constitute a negligible proportion of the signs in the city and equitable treatment of such signs has been the subject of judicial concern it would be inappropriate and misguided to be overly restrictive and prohibit such signs merely because other signs have been prohibited where such signs pose the additional  467 yonkers code  471 c1194  472

of this article and of zoning is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
