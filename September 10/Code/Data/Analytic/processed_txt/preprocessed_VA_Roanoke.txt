multiple purpose districts a the purpose of the mx district is to accommodate residential uses office uses and support services within the same district the intent of the district is that no retail sales uses be permitted and that the district facilitates a harmonious mixture of office and residential uses the regulations of the district are intended to protect the character and scale of such a mixeduse development pattern by permitting lowintensity development at a scale that recognizes and respects residential patterns of development b the purpose of the cn district is to encourage a concentration of neighborhoodscaled retail office and service uses in clearly defined compact areas in close proximity to residential neighborhoods the regulations of the district are intended to control the scale of nonresidential buildings in a manner that makes them compatible with and appropriate for surrounding residential areas and to encourage a development pattern that consists of ground floor commercial uses with offices and residential uses on the upper floor levels the district is intended to promote pedestrianoriented development with buildings located close to the street pedestrianscaled signage main entrances oriented to the street frontage sidewalk windows or display cases along building faades which face the street and significant building coverage of the site although parking areas may be provided they are generally limited in size and are deemphasized by their location on the site c the purpose of the cg district is to permit motor vehicle dependent uses that are generally developed as single use developments on individual lots subject to landscaping access and signage standards such development is generally characterized by individual curb cuts access drives and signage it is intended that this district be applied primarily along heavily traveled arterial streets with an emphasis on clustering such development at major intersections while recognizing the motor vehicle traffic generated by the uses permitted in this district it is the intent of the regulations of the district to encourage and recognize pedestrian access and public transit forms of transportation by locating parking to the side and rear of buildings and minimizing conflict signage standards the uses permitted in this district generally require a high volume of traffic along the frontage of the establishment and include horizontally oriented buildings such permitted uses include general retail establishments offices service establishments motor vehicle related sales and service eating establishments and entertainment uses the cg district is also intended to accommodate traveloriented uses such as hotels motels and gasoline stations d the purpose of the cls district is to accommodate multiple buildings and uses that are large in scale and generally characterized by multiple tenants or uses on a single zoning lot which share common parking curb cuts driveways and access to and from streets these uses and areas are heavily dependent on the motor vehicle and tend to result in large parking areas and outdoor display of merchandise cls district uses include large motor vehicle sales and service establishments and community and regional shopping centers the district standards provide for landscaped buffers to minimize the impact of cls uses on surrounding areas e the purpose of the d district is to permit a wide variety of uses and relatively intense development in the downtown consistent with historic development patterns in a manner that protects and enhances the business and cultural center of the city and region toward that end the downtown district is intended to accomplish the following 1 facilitate pedestrian ways and create a convenient and harmonious development of buildings streets and open space  2 protect and enhance the public interest in downtown as a source of economic vitality the retention and creation of jobs and tax revenue  3 protect existing investment in downtown to protect against the demolition of downtowns historic buildings to promote activity on public streets and to protect amenities provided investment  and 4 provide for a mix of high density residential commercial retail government services entertainment and cultural facilities and livework space f the purpose of the in district is to provide standards for the accommodation of institutional developments on zoning lots of five 5 acres or less in order to achieve the following specific purposes 1 recognize the unique needs of institutional uses and their relationship with neighboring land uses  2 reduce traffic congestion provide adequate parking and promote pedestrian linkages  3 facilitate the creation of a convenient and harmonious development of buildings parking and open spaces for individual institutional uses  4 ensure the proper functioning of such institutional uses  and 5 minimize the potential for adverse impacts of institutional uses on adjacent land uses g the purpose of the ros district is to recognize and enhance active park and recreation lands passive open spaces and significant natural and scenic features by encouraging these areas to protect unique land resources from degradation consistent with the recommendations of the citys comprehensive plan it is further intended to prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses while permitting limited construction within open space areas which is supportive of their function and which promotes their use and enjoyment h the purpose of the uf district is to promote high intensity mixed use development that is economically viable pedestrian oriented attractive and harmonious and contributes to the placemaking character of the city the district is designed to provide new development and redevelopment opportunities in the form of mixed use structures that offer a wide range of complementary land uses this special purpose district is intended to be applied to underperforming urban industrial areas that have sufficient infrastructure to support mixed use development the district provides for a mix of small scale industrial

footnotes  3  editors note of adopted sept 4 201 retitled div 5 offstreet parking and loading to read as herein set out purpose the purpose of this division is to set forth offstreet parking and loading requirements for permitted and special exception land uses in accordance with the intensity of such uses in a manner that a reduces traffic hazards and excessive levels of congestion on surrounding streets  b minimizes impact of driveways on the street system  c reduces conflict between motor vehicles and other forms of transportation  d encourages pedestrian access and alternative modes of transportation  e addresses motor vehicle parking loading and access issues  f provides options for the provision of adequate parking  and g is consistent with environmental goals such as stormwater management clean air and reduction of the heat island effect of expansive impervious surfaces  42009 applicability the offstreet parking and loading requirements of this division shall apply to any new structure or use any increase in intensity of use including an addition to or enlargement of an existing structure or a change of existing use no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until required offstreet parking and loading spaces have been established in accordance with the requirements of this division the repetitive parking of a vehicle or vehicles in a turf grass
