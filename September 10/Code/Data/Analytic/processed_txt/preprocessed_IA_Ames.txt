environmental impact criteria obtain from the idnr an npdes permit for the discharge of stormwater from a municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 the ms4 permit the city of ames city is subject to the program and is required to obtain and has obtained an ms4 permit the citys ms4 permit is on file at the office of the city clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours 2 as a condition of the citys ms4 permit the city is obliged to develop implement and enforce a program to address stormwater runoff from new construction and reconstruction projects for which stormwater permit coverage is required 3 no state or federal funds have been made available to assist the city with inspections monitoring andor enforcing the program accordingly the city shall fund its inspection monitoring and enforcement responsibilities entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the program by virtue of state and federal law andor other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance 4 land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition if left uncontrolled  this uncontrolled stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and  stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites 5 therefore city establishes this set of city stormwater standards applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development and other construction activities shall not result in increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety 6 the iowa

statutory authorization findings of fact and purpose 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of iowa has in iowa delegated the responsibility to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of ames are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property  health and safety hazards  disruption of commerce and governmental services  extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief  and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community b these flood losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by i the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood and ii the cumulative effect of flood plain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities c this ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the department of natural resources this methodology consists of a series of interrelated steps including i determination of flood magnitudes and the corresponding flood frequencies by statistical and engineering calculations which permits a consideration of such flood factors as expected frequency of occurrence area inundated and depth of inundation ii calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capability of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey flood flows iii computation and delineation of a floodway an area which must be reserved with no additional obstructions for conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be substantially increased by future encroachment on the flood plain 3 purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare by minimizing those flood losses described in 2 with provisions designed to a reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased by greater than one 1 foot b restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities c require that uses vulnerable to floods including public utilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement d protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard e assure that eligibility to purchase flood insurance national flood insurance program is maintained for property owners in the community general provisions 1 lands to which this ordinance shall apply to all

general the city of ames adopted the first rental housing  beginning then all rental dwellings were required to register with the city and be periodically inspected to assure continued compliance with minimum maintenance standards of that rental dwellings established prior to enactment of the not in compliance with one or more of the new standards mechanisms were created to evaluate such noncompliant conditions and approve those which could not practicably be made compliant and were judged to have a minimal impact on public health and safety or for which an equivalent alternative method of code compliance could be implemented to achieve the intent of the techniques used to resolve these cases were retroactive conversion permits board variances and administrative approvals 2 retroactive conversion permits as inspections occurred it was discovered that about 400 buildings had been previously converted from single family to multifamily dwellings or otherwise remodeled altered or improved without issuance of required building electrical mechanical or plumbing permits and without zoning approval those 400 buildings were found to be noncompliant with one or more of about 20 of the new standards in 198 the city council enacted an ordinance that grandfathered seven 7 of those code violations based upon a conclusion they posed no threat to tenant health or safety and that correction would be impracticable approvals of the following seven 7 conditions were granted to each owner who made application and met conditions for a retroactive conversion permit supp 20193 1317 rev 7119 a minimum required ceiling height of seven 7 feet in habitable rooms some single family homes converted to include basement apartments were unable to meet this standard and approvals were granted for fixed obstructions such as beams water and gas pipes and ductwork that projected to not less than 6 feet 8 inches above the floor for more than 20% of the floor area of the room b minimum room area some dwelling units were unable to meet the minimum room area square footage required by the new code such rooms were approvable provided square footage was not less than 75% of that required by the c minimum lot area some structures were built on small lots and unable to comply with the newer standards d building setbacks some structures located on small lots could not comply with newer required setbacks from property lines e lot frontage older structures on narrow lots could not comply with newer standards and in many cases houses were built entirely or partially behind one another making it impossible to comply with newer codes f building height g minimum required window space for natural light and ventilation many basement apartments were unable to meet this new standard and approvals were granted for including borrowed light from adjoining rooms in required calculations and accepting artificial illumination and mechanical ventilation in lieu of natural light and openable windows 3 board variances since 197 the housing appeal board has evaluated cases involving noncompliant conditions other than those eligible for approval under the retroactive conversion permit process a number of approvals of specific noncompliant conditions were granted based upon the boards conclusion they posed no threat to tenant health or safety and that correction would be impracticable or that an equivalent method of compliance was provided that met the intent of the 4 administrative approvals since 197 the building official evaluated individual cases of noncompliant conditions in which correction would be impracticable such as offstreet parking when it was concluded that such approvals would not create a health or safety hazard and that compliance with the letter of the code was not possible administrative approvals were granted approvals shall continue  conditions 1 general all prior official approvals of noncompliant conditions as detailed in

the occurrence of any of the events described in b above the zoning enforcement officer shall document such event and shall issue a notice to the property owner by certified mail return receipt requested stating that the property owners intent to abandon the nonconforming use is presumed and that the nonconforming use will be terminated unless the property owner submits an answer within 30 days of the date the notice was issued however no notice of abandonment is required when a property owner has initiated a change of use or received approvals from the city for changes to use of the property or property improvements iv answer the answer shall indicate the property owners intention to resume the nonconforming use and shall describe the actions the property owner intends to take within 90 days of submission of the answer to resume the nonconforming use answers must be on forms provided by the zoning enforcement officer a if an answer is submitted within 30 days of the issuance of the notice but the nonconforming use is not resumed within the 90 days following submission of an answer the nonconforming use shall be terminated at the end of that 90day period once a nonconforming use is terminated subsequent uses of the property must conform to this if no answer is submitted within 30 days of the issuance of the notice the nonconforming use will be terminated v overcoming presumption of abandonment the presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon a showing to the satisfaction of the zoning board of adjustment that during the 12month period in question the owner of the land or structure has been a maintaining the land and structure in accordance with the building did not intend to discontinue the use  b actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for sale or lease  or c engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there was no intent to abandon vi calculation of period of abandonment any period of discontinuance or

and repair maintenance remodeling and repair of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted without a variance or a special use permit provided that such maintenance remodeling or repair does not increase the degree of nonconformity i remodeling an alteration to a nonconforming structure is classified as remodeling if either the majority of the exterior walls or the roof is maintained out construction in the event only an element of the structure eg one wall is nonconforming the remodeling of that feature must maintain 50% or more of its structural support and wall assembly to be considered remodeling and not rebuilding of the structure nothing within this definition is intended to restrict the adding or changing of window and door openings or changes to exterior siding and

this effective shall be deemed to be in conformance with this the extent that it is consistent with the approved plan and to the extent that such plan or conditions imposed thereon directly addresses the specific issue involved in the determination of conformity however redevelopment of a site with a prior site development plan approval must conform to the current zoning standards for issuance of a new certificate of compliance b policy because nonconformities such as those listed above involve less investment and are more easily corrected than those involving lots buildings and uses it is generally the policy of the city to eliminate such other nonconformities as quickly as practicable practicable improvements take in to account current conditions planter dimensions building spacing
