sexually explicit shows c each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating d the information received at the public forum held on  and at the city commission meeting of  confirms that the secondary effects described above and experienced by other municipal governments do occur in and around sexually oriented businesses located and existing in the city of kalamazoo and the surrounding area the commission also finds that educational and artistic uses of nudity or sexual content also occur

preventing the negative secondary effects associated with adult uses and to prevent a concentration of these uses within any one area or to prevent deterioration or blighting of a nearby residential
