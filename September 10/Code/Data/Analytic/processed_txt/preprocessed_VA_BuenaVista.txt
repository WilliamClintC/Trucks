waters of the 100year flood the basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the food insurance study fis for rockbridge county and incorporated areas including the city of buena vista prepared by the federal emergency management agency federal insurance administration dated  as amended a the floodway district is delineated for purposes of this ordinance using the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the 100year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point these areas included in this district are specifically defined in table 3 of the above referenced flood insurance study and shown on the accompanying flood insurance rate maps  b the floodfringe district shall be that area of the 100year floodplain not included in the floodway district the basis for the outermost boundary of this district shall be the 100year flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above referenced flood insurance study and as shown on the accompanying flood insurance rate maps  c the approximated floodplain district shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles of elevations are provided but where a 100year floodplain boundary has been approximated such areas are shown as zone a on the flood insurance rate maps accompanying the flood insurance study

buena vista preface nestled in the mountains of virginia buena vista enjoys a beautiful setting a rich diversity of people and neighborhoods cultural and educational opportunities and a tradition of active participation by its citizens in recreational and service related activities it is quiet and safe community where you can imagine children growing up on every street now the community faces the challenge of preserving and enhancing its positive attributes and the quality of life that they offer in a time of growth and change this document establishes design standards to protect the quality of life in buena vista while allowing it to evolve into a truly great community of the 21st century a intention appendix a and the following appendixes have been approved by the buena vista city council and are intended to aid citizens builders developers designers and the city of buena vista in the process of protecting and modifying the built environment within the city by focusing on basic design principles regulations patterns and standards this document is designed to protect the value and the quality of the neighborhood and to help situate the social economic and environmental health of the community this document is not intended to address issues of ownership or land use instead this document focuses on the design of the built environment these standards are not intended to restrict or limit imagination innovation or architectural style but instead provide a framework of guiding rules that ensure the compatibility of building forms in relationship to massing form scale texture and material b guiding principles in order to create conserve and encourage a more habitable urban environment within the seminary hill district of buena vista the following five principles are the foundation of this document 1 livability the creation and conservation of livable streets and neighborhoods most people will agree that they want to have livable streets and neighborhoods but what does that mean while difficult to quantify and define livable is described by the american planning association as a place where people can bring up children have privacy sleep eat relax and rest it implies a place that is well managed and relatively devoid of nuisance overcrowding noise danger air pollution dirt and trash during public meetings held in buena vista the citizens described the qualities that add to the livability of their community as a safe environment pedestrian friendly streets quiet established neighborhoods tree lined streets access to natural beauty a strong connection to downtown areas and a sense of history furthermore the citizens also described a list of attributes that detract from the livability of their community as traffic and street problems vacant stores loss of landscaping and street trees high percentage of heavy vehicles on roads sidewalks that are not well maintained new structures that are not compatible with the neighborhood overgrown lots lack of communication and understanding about current and future development construction of housing that average people can afford lack of restaurants and businesses lack of retirement facilities and inadequate zoning processes 2 critical mass the creation of a minimum level of human and building density within an intensity of land uses urban fabric requires people to live work play learn and do all the things that people do in close proximity to each other in order to foster human exchange public life diversity and community neighborhoods must be more than a stage set without people there must be a critical mass of people that spend a lot of their time in the neighborhood including time spent at home 3 integration the encouragement of living working shopping public spiritual and recreational uses in reasonable walkable proximity to each other 4 positive urban places manmade environments particularly buildings that define public space in a manner that creates a place as opposed to buildings that for the most part sit in space 5 organic growth many separate buildings with complex arrangements and relationships built over time as opposed to a few large buildings built all at once the underlying concept of allowing a community to grow organically is based upon the recognition that the community is alive that it will grow and evolve over time growth that occurs in numerous small increments ensures the stability of the whole as each proposed project applies for zoning approval it shall be examined in relationship to the whole in this way two types of projects are discouraged longterm overly specific master plans and extremely large projects c master plans this principle of organic growth precludes zoning approval of a master plan without reserving the right and expectation of the zoning administrator to review each structure within that plan for approval at the point in time that the land owner is ready and committed to implement it for example a specific 20year master plan could outline the construction of three specific buildings to be constructed every five years for the next 20 years this approach is valid for fund raising planning and visioning purposes while this document is not intended to prevent landowners from developing a vision such a vision cannot be considered zoning approval this latter approach would fail to take into account that the needs of the landowner developer andor the community could significantly change during that 20year period the preferred master planning approach would be to have a more generalized vision for the longterm that vision could then be developed into successive shortterm master plans not to exceed a five to seven year time frame each while each shorterterm master plan cannot guarantee zoning approval of any specific project within the master plan it would allow the city and the landowner to establish some common guidelines and understandings to work within as each specific project within the plan was to be implemented it would be independently presented and evaluated in the city zoning approval process this preferred approach allows both the landowner and the city maximum flexibility to respond to external forces ie economic and social forces as well as providing an environment for all parties to learn from the previous project in the master plan applying for zoning approval for a specific project requires the submission of all documents necessary for a building permit master plans generally do not provide this level of detail about a structure to be constructed d extremely large projects this principle of organic growth is incompatible with extremely large single building projects  instead such projects may be authorized only conditional zoning process for example a landowner might wish zoning approval for a two million square foot parking garage this principle would suggest a solution to incrementally build several smaller parking garages and allowing each of the smaller garages to be built in response to its surroundings this allows a greater mix of uses within the community and also lowers the financial risks involved in any single increment of construction please note that large structures are not forbidden by this document  but they require a more rigorous review and approval process in order to protect the neighborhood appendix b  buildings design standards individual projects and structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings in an organic and evolutionary manner this issue is independent of the architectural style of the building as each project is conceived it shall be designed to provide positive urban space a building should be placed and shaped in a manner that reinforces the street and alley grid structure the urban place of the community is the space that is created by buildings and structures each project should be examined in terms of the space that it creates this space should be well formed in addition a project might lend itself toward the creation of pedestrian walkways or urban gardens through gradual piecemeal growth the projects should add to the larger whole of the neighborhood a general standards 1 all proposed structures within the neighborhood must be built in accordance with all applicable federal state and local laws and ordinances 2 all structures shall be built in compliance with the bocacabo model building code as a minimum standard 3 all new development must be careful to integrate into the existing neighborhood or district placement of new structures in residential districts shall take care to maintain privacy between existing structures 4 the building footprint of any single structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the area of a city block without going conditional use permitting process 5 single large buildings meeting or exceeding the sizes set forth below must receive a conditional use permit prior to construction district square feet mixed residential 10000 mixed business 10000 institutional 25000 6 building designs shall be sensitive to the neighborhood character with regard to scale style and use of material massing and historical context 7 buildings are to be designed specifically for their site repetitive building designed used in other communities should not be used if a landowner wishes to construct a building that was designed for a different location or with no location in mind then the landowner would need to go conditional use permitting process and demonstrate the compliance with the other standards in this document and the compatibility and appropriateness of the building to the neighborhood repetitive design 8 buildings shall achieve a human scale and pedestrian interest this can be achieved by using elements like balconies awnings canopies arcades reveals etc 9 the glazing materials on the front elevation of buildings should not exceed 75 percent 50 percent in the mixed business district of its overall surface area the glazing materials on the ground floor of the front elevation of buildings should not be less than 50 percent of its overall surface area 10 buildings must be divided into increments or bays along the street front that respect the existing rhythm of the street these bays should never exceed 50 feet wide structures should be subdivided along the street elevation with columns pilasters change in material etc to break up the wall plane the building may extend as necessary along the street front 200 feet for example but visible articulation of the mass

requesting zoning approval within designated districts the physical definition of streets and other public spaces are essential to the quality of place for the neighborhood streets are considered to be interlinked public spaces that should be designed to be safe comfortable and interesting to the pedestrian obviously streets must also adequately accommodate automobiles but not at the expense of the pedestrian accessibility or openness a general standards 1 an engineer licensed in the state of virginia shall design all streets 2 streets that will be dedicated to the city shall be built to vdot standards 3 all streets shall be built along the traditional rectilinear grid pattern of city of buena vista and have interconnected streets no streets may end in a culdesac exceptions to this standard may be granted on a casebycase basis where topography prevents this street pattern from being implemented in cases where topography prevents a traditional rectilinear street grid from being implemented it is still required to have interconnected streets 4 all new streets except alleys shall be lined with trees 5 street vistas all streets except alleys should frame vistas of core areas public buildings parks andor other natural features any street that terminates should do so at significant buildings or places because the property at the end of a street vista becomes the centerpiece of the urban street fabric its design must be considered by more carefully 6 onstreet parking is required on all streets except alleys and thoroughfares 7 in alleys utilities power lines telephone cable etc may be above ground all other streets and roads shall have all associated utilities power lines telephone cable etc buried below ground 8 all new intersections within the neighborhood shall have the pattern of a sidewalk bulb stamped into the asphalt everywhere that there is on street parking this is a matter of stripping and no a matter of actual elevation changes in the street crosssection the use of a true elevated sidewalk bulb is not required this bulb pattern flares out into the parking lane while it does not encroach upon the traffic lanes it does provide a visual hierarchy between pedestrian and car 9 all streets except alleys shall have curb and gutter on both sides of the roadway and be designed to flow into a stormwater management system that is approved by the city   b materials materials shall provide a nonmonolithic texture color and pattern for the pedestrian additionally the sidewalks and crosswalks shall exist in contrast to the road surface for example given a standard black asphalt road surface the sidewalks and crosswalk surfaces could be continuous brick cobblestone or stamped dyed asphalt alternatively the surfaces could also be a more monolithic material such as asphalt or concrete if the materials above are used to articulate the pedestrian surfaces and create an appropriate pattern an example of this would be five feet square concrete pads surrounded with brick pavers c street types in order to meet the diverse transportation needs of the neighborhood we recognize that several types of streets may be necessary or desired ranging from more pedestrian oriented streets to more vehicular oriented streets towards this realization we have developed three street typologies which are designed to meet these various needs over time it may be necessary to revise these prototypical streets or to add new prototype streets to this typology all streets in subject to these regulations shall be designated to be one of the street types specified in this document all currently existing streets public or private shall belong to the town street category until such time as the city changes its designation no modifications to streets are required until such time as significant renovations modifications or construction is done to the street if a landowner chooses to make significant modifications to structures along a street the corresponding street improvements may be required by the city when a new street is proposed whether that street is public or private it shall be designated to be one of the street types specified in this document and built to those standards 1 thoroughfare  description the intention for this street type is to handle increased traffic along major access roads running commercial area it is envisioned that beech avenue and 29th street west of ridge avenue could be expanded in the future to this type of street reviving the old historic downtown mixeduse nature of these streets the road would be a divided highway with each side of road having two travel lanes plus a parking lane design criteria design speed trees lightingtrees 35 mph 250 on center flowering trees 35 surface

sidewalks with arcades forming a promenades squares and centers that identify offices laboratories lecture halls student quarters etc while mixeduse development is encouraged throughout the neighborhood it is envisioned that the institutional district will generate a highdensity population that mostly pedestrian the pedestrian street requires the incorporation of appropriate locations for bike racks in addition to parking while the use of landscaping is required it may be located at both sides of the street or in the center creating a common pedestrian street with commons design criteria design speed travel lanes parking lane 1520 mph 2 lane at 10 810 trees landscaped common sidewalk 250 on center flowering trees 1530 surface must be landscaped 1020 pedestrian street profile

the parking space requirement b surface lots parking shall be located in the rear or side of buildings in no case will parking lots be allowed to be placed in front of a building or be set any farther forward on the lot than the main structure on a lot att a 1 in areas where surface parking lots border the street edge a vegetation border shall be established this border may include grass flowers trees and hedges 2 when a corner lot is used for parking a threefoot garden wall that may incorporate seating may be used in place of hedges and screen planting 3 the parking lot shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building in order to achieve this a sidewalk shall be placed at the perimeter of the lot in lots that have more than 20 spaces pedestrian

constructed adjacent to a street or highway with adequate safeguards that motorized vehicles will not attempt to enter the path to be successful bicycle paths should be designed to avoid conflict points with streets and other obstacles provision of bridges or underpasses careful attention should also be taken regarding overall security when paths are located in less developed areas if there is enough rightofway bicycle paths should be at least ten feet wide and optimally up to 12 feet in width if a great deal of pedestrian use is expected individual development projects shall make provision for constructing portions of a bicycle path shown on the approved plan that lie within the project as well as providing appropriate links to any bicycle path abutting the project bicycle paths should
