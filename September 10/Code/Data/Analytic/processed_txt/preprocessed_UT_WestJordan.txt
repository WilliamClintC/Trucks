all three 3 subdistricts acity centercore ccc the ccc subdistrict is generally described as an area that is approximately forty two 42 acres in size an area more commonly identified as the briarwood commercial center this subdistrict is envisioned to have the highest intensity uses with a balanced land use mix of office retail and service and mixed use residential and cultural uses within mid to high rise buildings small retail and service shops and restaurants shall be located along principal pedestrian corridors higher intensity uses shall be located along major public thoroughfares a major public open space area should anchor this subdistrict with smaller landscaped areas connecting the larger open space area in a well planned but dispersed network of sidewalks and walkways residential land uses in this subdistrict will be strictly limited to mixed use development where residential units may be only located above a more intensive retail service office or restaurant use the ccc subdistrict is situated within the transit station overlay district where the land use layout of this district will be integral to the functional aspects of pedestrian activity and commerce bcity centerresidential ccr the ccr subdistrict is generally described as an area that is approximately twenty seven 27 acres in size an area more commonly identified today as the brookside mobile home estates this subdistrict is envisioned to have a mixture of medium to high density housing with a small amount of retail service office andor restaurant uses along the frontage of redwood road and the midblock thoroughfares adjacent to the future light rail station though higher in density this subdistrict is to act as a buffer between the residential uses to the south and the anticipated higher densities within the ccc subdistrict public and private open spaces shall be found throughout the ccr subdistrict connected to each other by a well planned sidewalk system when this area is redeveloped bingham creek shall be protected and enhanced as an adequate riparian buffer and corridor creating a natural public open space amenity with a multiuse trail ccity centerframe ccf 1the ccf subdistrict consists of four 4 different areas which total approximately thirty eight 38 acres in size this subdistrict is envisioned to expand upon the existing mixture of auto oriented retail service office and restaurant uses the city envisions that over time the established uses along the north side of 7800 south and the west side of redwood road will be replaced by uses that are larger in scale but remain mostly auto oriented 2because of the high traffic patterns of both 7800 south and redwood road pedestrian connectivity and walkability from the ccc to the cc f subdistricts is not feasible  however architectural and site design standards shall be incorporated into this area to establish a sense of place and to act as a gateway to the city center zone when this area is

waivers and density bonuses for these required improvements shall not apply eoptional development improvements or amenities the criteria listed in the wspa standards and incentive chart as optional may be selected at the discretion of the developer as a means of both improving an overall development and qualifying for incremental density bonuses the weighted percentage points are applied to the base density where the total allowed percentage number is multiplied by the base density to achieve a higher overall density though the total accrual of percentage points may exceed one hundred percent 100% in no case can density exceed the maximum dwelling units per acre for the developments underlying zoning district fsubstitute improvements and amenities the optional improvements amenities listed in wspa standards and incentive chart are not exclusive there may be design and improvement amenities not listed in the chart that meet the intent of this section a developer may propose substitute improvements in the preliminary development plan which may be approved by the city council if approved the city council shall assign a weighted value to the substitute improvement the weighted value awarded shall be based on the optional improvement in the chart that bears the closest resemblance to the substitute improvement example a developer dedicates land to the city for a school site in exchange for a density bonus award a gated community will not count as an improvementamenity for the purposes of density bonuses within the wspa although included optional

following 1sensitive hillside land with a slope gradient greater than thirty percent 30% 2land that is to be dedicated for right of way purposes on the future land use map designated as an arterial collector or highway freeway and that is greater than sixty six feet 66 in width any portion of land in a right of way which is in excess of sixty six feet 66 in width may be reimbursed by the city upon request by a developer but may not be calculated for density purposes rights of way that are less than sixty six feet 66 in width may be included in the calculation of density the optional landscape buffer as described in section 135j6 of this article may be included for purpose of calculating density 3any land that is determined to be within a primary drainage corridor creekwash or wetland area the city council may consider land that is to be dedicated for public purposes either for reimbursement or as an area of land eligible for the purposes of calculating density hdetermination and calculation of density when the developer agrees to install certain improvements and amenities in a proposed development as detailed in the required submittal of a development plan the density of a development may be increased following method 1first determine the base density from the chart in subsection a of this section 2then multiply the base density number by the weighted percentage value expected for installed improvements 3lastly add the multiplied value referenced in subsection h2 of this section by the base density number in the zoning district to which the project is located this will be the new density subject for approval example a developments zone is lsfr with a base density of 201 since the developer selects to install an entryway monument worth 10 percentage points the base density can be increased by 10 percent  so 201 x 10   201  201 + 201   221 the new base density is now 221 du per acre for determining density all calculations shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth igranting of density in wspa final density shall be determined by the city council at the time of master development plan or preliminary subarea development plan approval density in the wspa is directly tied to the weighted percentage values expected for installed improvements as listed in the wspa standards and incentive chart dwelling unit density shall never exceed the maximum for the developments applicable zoning district regardless of the amount of density bonus awards granted example maximum allowable density for the mfr zoning district is 900

oriented development in areas that are generally located within an approximate onefourth 14 mile of light rail transit stations or cross town satellite hubs for bustrolley rapid transit bthe tsod district consists of six 6 different transit community station types located strategically at light rail or fast rapid transit stops throughout the city the transit community stations are established to promote and share a number of transit oriented development concepts but also have their own emphasis on specific uses allowed within each station planning area based on its location in the city the uses are classified separately based on intensity of use and the existing zoning in the area the overlay districts are intended to work as an incentive to create clustered mixed use and pedestrian friendly neighborhoods and working environments the objectives of the overlay district are to 1permit and support higher development densities to encourage the utilization of mass transit and alternative modes of transportation other than the automobile 2allow for mixed land uses which contain a flexible arrangement of residential commercial and mixed use developments while adopting detailed urban development standards to ensure compatibility between the uses and pedestrian activity 3minimize distances between destinations by providing for a number of conveniences and uses which are compatible with one another and which are within an approximate onefourth 14 mile walking distance of each other ie home to office home to retail service or office to retail service 4promote pedestrian friendly design and architectural structuring that encourages walking and bicycling 5reduce transportation spending and increase housing affordability lessening of transportation development and maintenance costs 6increase incentives for developers from less money and land spent on parking and road installation and maintenance costs 7decrease auto dependency by providing alternative methods of transportation and provide planning methods which take into consideration those who cannot drive or afford an automobile 8create and enhance cultural use areas that promote neighborhood and local social activities 9integrate open spaces plazas courtyards and pocket parks and connect these areas to all other uses in the station district 10provide for a development plan that has economic viability where the city will benefit from the project as a whole in the form of tax increments private investment and the creation of new jobs 11allow for greater flexibility in street and road infrastructure features that distinguish the area as unique create a distinctive ambiance to the development and reduce maintenance costs parking and right of way widths 2001   amd

use development of residential commercial office retail and recreational uses high development densities shall be allowed within this station community with a primary focus on high density residential being supported by a nonresidential mix of uses it is essential that the transit station be easily accessible by all proposed development designed walkways within this community all land uses are to be pedestrian oriented and well connected to open spaces parks plazas and social gathering areas cgardner village station community the intent of this station community is to provide easy and convenient access to existing commercial retail services and restaurants and to serve as a commencement point for recreational activities at the adjacent trailhead for the jordan river parkway land uses shall contain a mix of retail services and various types of medium to high density residential uses within an easy walking distance to the proposed transit station land uses in this station community need not be entirely supportive of each other however the multiple uses must link to a pedestrian network of trails and sidewalks and to the transit station dresidential station community the prevailing use in the residential station community areas is singlefamily residential the intent of the residential station community is to provide walkable access to and from the proposed transit station for the existing residential neighborhoods nonresidential uses need not be provided nor are they necessary within this community station a pedestrian walkway network shall be installed that will support transit ridership in the immediate vicinity a park and ride lot shall be provided near each station for residents who live in the vicinity who may wish to travel by alternative methods ebagley station community the bagley station community is intended to serve the light industrial work force in and around the southwestern portion of the city transit riders served by this transit station will primarily be going to or coming from work it will be necessary to serve the area with improved pedestrian network systems for safe walking and it will be vital for this station to accommodate a park and ride lot and bus station it may also benefit some of the large businesses in the area to serve their transit riders with shuttles f5600 west brt station communities there is a possibility that the city will be served by bus rapid transit or trolley in the future this alternative method of transit could allow the city to develop small pockets of transit oriented type uses at major transit stop sites these stations would primarily be mixed use with an approximate overlay of one fourth 14 mile radius around the proposed brt stop sites located at 5600 west old bingham highway 5600 west 9000 south and 5600 west 7800 south uses in these stations shall contain a mix of compacted but compatible uses with an emphasis of high density multifamily and moderate community commercial uses pedestrian safety will be a key component of these transit stations design of this station community shall be pedestrian friendly where transit commuters and shoppers do not have to compete with the automobile a park and ride facility or parking structure should be placed within a reasonable distance of a proposed transit station in this community 2001   amd 2009    136g4

1energy efficiency and comfort of its inhabitants are essential to the successful design of a building to the extent possible building should be oriented to minimize eastwest exposures and should utilize high performance technological solutions andor shade control the proposed building orientation should respect climactic conditions by minimizing heat gain and considering the impact of shade on adjacent land uses and areas 2maintaining continuity of pedestrian routes is desirable the proposed building orientation should relate to other buildings on the same site in regard to pedestrian circulation and surrounding buildings 3service areas such as loading docks refuse collection areas and similar facilities that could be sources of odor noise and smoke or could be visually objectionable should not be located in highly traveled areas service areas should be located away from public view 4placement of the building in relation to the surrounding elements is as important as the building design the proposed building orientation should respect the orientation of surrounding buildings and the orientation of surrounding streets gequestrian paths an adequate surface and width

though the lot were conforming dlot merger if a lot is smaller than required by this title and such lot is at any time after the effective date hereof under common ownership with an adjacent lot then the two 2 shall be considered merged for purposes of this title and shall in the future be considered together for purposes of determining compliance if merged lots contain sufficient area for a use then they shall be deemed fully conforming if merged lots together do not contain sufficient area for a use they shall nonetheless be considered together for purposes of reducing the degree of

exempt the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to billboards nonconforming billboards shall be terminated in accordance with applicable provisions of utah section 109a512 2001  chapter 10 urban design standards  purpose and scope 13102 urban design principles 13101 purpose and scope the purpose of this chapter is to establish urban design parameters and standards for all development within the city 2001  13102 urban design principles acharacter and condition of city these principles are based on a shared understanding of the current character and condition of the city as follows 1the city reflects a diversity of architectural styles 2the city is a moderately sized city in the salt lake valley with the potential to become one of the three 3 largest cities in the state 3the city has been developed largely in small pieces occupying a large land area despite its size the separation of those pieces remains as a barrier to the goals of community and a higher quality of life the city should seek to diminish these forces of separation in the form of the city by fostering an attitude of neighborliness within the urban fabric each development should enhance its neighborhood and relate to the city as a whole 4the city is currently oriented to vehicles that travel at an average speed of thirty five 35 miles per hour in the city limits new development should foster the creation of environments with a priority for pedestrians the average pedestrian moves at about four 4 miles per hour and views and uses the environment in a detailed fashion bcontext every development has a relationship to its setting positive relations can be achieved by examining the next largest and smallest context of the site ignoring the context can often assure poor relationships 1the size character and setting of proposed projects should relate to their specific contexts and functions of adjacent streets and pedestrian networks buildings should be oriented to public rights of way as well as additional internal circulation systems 2new development should incorporate building materials and technology that are compatible with the arid setting and that are responsive to the climate of this region camenitycomfort urban conditions such as paved areas and buildings generating reflected heat create aridity and require mitigating design features which enhance habitability 1promote human comfort by providing shaded areas courtyards colonnades and other areas as site amenities 2create developments for the ease of pedestrians both on and off the site 3promote the creation of public and semipublic places at both large and small scales to encourage a sense of community 4create a sense of place that respects nature and utilizes natural and manmade materials and devices 5encourage separation of pedestrians and automobiles 6promote nighttime uses of sites with secure well lighted amenity zones and programmed activities dvisual interest an environment that contains a harmonious balance of various forms and materials can be visually interesting too much variety or too much uniformity can lack visual interest new development should seek to preserve and enhance this basic human need 1incorporate architectural and landscape elements at the pedestrian level 2maintain a pedestrian scale by creating variation of the urban form 3recognize the interest created by both the repetition and changes in various project patterns from window openings to paving designs 4promote a diversity of architectural styles 5integrate arts and crafts creatively into the built environment 6when a project occurs in a visually rich context its form materials orientation and detailing should incorporate the assets offered by its setting 7when a project occurs in a setting devoid of visual interest it should seek to provide a wide variety of forms and texture eactivity environments that provide a variety of choices for people are generally active settings for people to gather this fosters a sense of community when a visit can serve multiple needs in a setting that provides safety security and activity 1encourage mixed use developments so as to provide increased opportunities for informal and planned activities beyond the typical nine oclock  am to five oclock  pm work hours 2promote design that will increase opportunities for activities both within the project boundaries and between existing adjacent developments and neighborhoods 3where feasible encourage design of single usage facilities to accommodate retail and other uses at the pedestrian level to encourage activity and use fclarity and convenience an environment that is easy to understand will usually also be convenient for the people who use it that is not to say complexity must be avoided complexity can offer excitement but not at the expense of routine accessibility of the general public 1environments should be created that are understandable and help orient the user and the general public 2developments should be convenient to and accessible by persons with physical limitations and disabilities 3developments should derive their basic order from the underlying geometry of city streets and the northsouth eastwest orientation it implies this will assist the ready comprehensibility of the city individual projects should relate to existing streets and canals except where creative design establishes a more successful relationship to new streets pedestrian walkways or major open spaces 4sites should be planned to respect existing natural and manmade landmarks and to create landmarks for the ease of public recognition 5protect major vistas and panoramas that give special emphasis to open space and mountains 6design project signage and environmental graphics at a scale that provides clarity to the pedestrian as well as the automobile and does not result in visual clutter gcharacterdistinctiveness every project should strive to enhance the unique character of its neighborhood without limiting the creative opportunities for the specific project the development should help make its neighborhood more distinctive 1each development should contribute to the character identified for each project and the specific character for neighborhoods within each project 2promote neighborhood identity by planning elements that reinforce the landscape and built character of the area 3the character and environments should be designed at a human scale as well as within its neighborhood identity hdefinition of space streets parking lots buildings and landscape are the major elements that define the special qualities of our environment organize them to foster a setting supportive to the pedestrian as well as the driver 1relate the size character and setting of proposed projects to the functions of adjacent streets and pedestrian networks buildings should be oriented to the public rights of way and close to pedestrian movement 2the areas immediately adjacent to buildings should be designed to integrate with surrounding landscape and pedestrian walkways shaded courtyards cloisters trellises colonnades and public art are encouraged for consideration into the design to define space 3in an effort to create safe pedestrian walkways on highly traveled public rights of way a buffer area should separate the sidewalk from the street curb 4on street parking should be encouraged in village core business areas to further protect the pedestrian zone from vehicular traffic iviews city dwellers and visitors alike appreciate being reminded of the beauty of their environment protecting views of the environment assist in fostering appreciation of our environment as well as allowing the environment to aid in orienting people spatially within the city 1protect major vistas and panoramas that give special emphasis to open space mountains and special manmade or natural landmarks 2promote the creation of views both from within a project and from the adjacent streets and neighborhoods into the project consider the access to views of both the project users and the general public 3create opportunities for incorporating individual projects into the patterns and sequence of views that exist within an area neighborhood or urban village 4limit the use of sound walls or fences over eight feet 8 in height that diminish view corridors jvarietycontrast variety of site and building design helps to create interest within an urban area coupled with attention to creating environments for human activities such variety fosters goals of creating identifiable neighborhoods and of encouraging creative development 1promote variety and diversity of building and site design within a context of urban and architectural continuity 2create environments that encourage a number of specific activities fronting the street court or plaza at ground level to provide variety at a human scale kscale and pattern ultimately all developments must relate to the human scale patterns help humanize development 1a large structure should contain elements which transition to the human scale particularly near the ground 2if a development is larger or smaller than its adjacent physical context the design should provide transitional elements at the perimeter to integrate it with its surroundings 3the variation of scale pattern and texture of building and landscaping elements is encouraged to create a more visually interesting project the variety should be readable at the pedestrian scale as well as from a distance skyline 4the proportion between the height of a building and the width of the street and setback determine the basic urban form if the intent of the design is urban in character the height should be greater and the setback less 5buildings should be designed to reveal or express their primary patterns of use and entry this will not only assist comprehensibility but also achieve a desirable variety
