control objectives an erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the plan fails to address the following control objectives 1 identify critical areas onsite areas that are subject to severe erosion and offsite areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion andor sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention 2 limit time of exposure all landdisturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time 3 limit exposed areas all landdisturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time 4 control surface water surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure 5 control sedimentation all landdisturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent offsite sedimentation damage 6 manage stormwater runoff when the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a landdisturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse a plan is to include measures to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream  design and performance standards a except as provided in section 328b2 of this chapter erosion and sedimentation control measures structures and devices shall be planned designed and constructed to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the

velocity by 095 for slightly sinuous by 09 for moderately sinuous channels and by 08 for highly sinuous channels c acceptable management measures measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences the city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results some alternatives while not exhaustive are to 1 avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious  2 avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity paved sections 3 provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge  4 protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections andor providing erosionresistant lining  and 5 upgrade or replace the receiving device structure or watercourse such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity d exceptions this rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to the city that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse  borrow and waste areas when the person conducting the landdisturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity areas from which borrow is obtained and
