the applicant feels would be helpful to the public works commission in considering the application b before the public works commission may grant a variance it shall make the following _indings which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based 1 there are practical dif_iculties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the chapter in order to determine that there are practical dif_iculties or unnecessary hardships the public works commission must _ind the _ive following conditions exist a if the applicant complies with the provisions of this chapter the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of his property merely providing that the variance would permit a greater pro_it to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the commission in granting a variance moreover the public works commission shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of his property b the hardship results from the application of this chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship c the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property d the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates this chapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and then comes to the public works commission for relief e the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice 2 the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit 3 in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the public works commission shall not grant a variance if it _inds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare c in granting the variance the public works commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter if the variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan d the public works commission shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it _inds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application e a variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision f if the application calls for the granting of a major

commitments of private capital by private developers which private developers are unwilling to risk without suf_icient assurances that development standards will remain stable extended period of the

development concepts and standards while still managing the impacts on the surrounding areas 6 negotiating flexibility to better structure and manage development approvals for such largescale

description the regional activity center overlay district is created to promote the continued vitality of areas of the city that demonstrate a common economically signi_icant contribution to the community by ensuring continued compatibility between existing and future uses in terms of type scale and character and by promoting compatibility with other uses proximate to the designated regional activity center b types of regional activity centers each regional activity center is uniquely de_ined based upon its speci_ic economic contribution to the community for example regional activity center that is de_ined by a concentration of retail and restaurant uses would be designated in such a manner to support those uses as the dominant categories of land use within the activity center likewise a regional activity center based around a large medical use would include a land use focus supportive of the medical use c application prior to designating an area as a regional activity center overlay district an analysis shall be prepared to identify the de_ining land uses that make up the district to identify land uses which are compatible with or incompatible with the de_ining land uses and to identify development characteristics including scale of development and site design features that complement or threaten the de_ining land uses in establishing a regional activity center overlay district city council may establish limitations on permitted uses and special uses allowed in the underlying zoning district or districts within the regional activity center city council may also establish standards with regard to development characteristics that support the de_ining uses of the regional activity center such as setbacks location and amount of parking access to and buffering of land uses proximate to the regional activity center overlay district and similar standards intended to ensure that the regional activity center is maintained as a discrete contributor to the citys economic mission such use limitations and development standards shall be clearly set forth in the ordinance adopting the regional activity center overlay district d designation of

already identi_ied in the use table as allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated land use should be interpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district
