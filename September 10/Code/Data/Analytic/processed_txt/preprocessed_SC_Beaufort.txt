d e 9 23 transectbased and conventional districts  purpose and intent of the transect approach most of the zoning districts for the city of beaufort are ordered and classified according to the ruraltourban transect see diagram below the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a continuum of conditions ranging from natural and rural lands to urban centers the value of the transect is that it groups compatible buildings public spaces and infrastructure by scale and intensity of use while still allowing the development of neighborhoods where residents and workers can walk to work school and daily errands for example a public space at the edge of the city may be a large regional park with hiking trails while a public space in the city center may be a more intimate square where markets and events take place similarly a residence near the edge of the city may be on a large lot set back from the street while a residence in the downtown area may be a condominium in a three or fourstory building the transect approach is implemented in beaufort levels of development intensity that range from the t1natural preserve at the low end to the t5downtown

product or physical characteristics characteristics include the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions the use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate districts c principal uses principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use the characteristics subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use 1 developments with multiple principal uses when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category d accessory uses accessory uses are allowed byright in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in this unless otherwise stated accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions see for additional standards for accessory uses and structures e use of examples the examples subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category the names of these sample uses are generic they are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself for example a use that calls itself a wholesale warehouse but sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category this is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category f similar use interpretation criteria the following considerations shall be used in making similar use interpretations 1 the actual or projected

should also be compatible with the surrounding context civic buildings may include but are not limited to municipal buildings churches libraries schools hospitals and public recreation facilities museums may sometimes be considered civic buildings civic buildings do not include day care facilities retail buildings residential buildings and privatelyowned office buildings a placement in order to provide greater flexibility to create a special architectural statement civic buildings are not subject to minimum or maximum setback requirements instead building placement should be designed with consideration of the following guidelines 1 placement of civic buildings depending upon program and site can often benefit from being set back from the adjacent buildto lines of private development this allows the scale of the building to have more visual emphasis and can create a public space in the foreground the amount of this setback should be carefully determined based on the urban design objectives of the particular site 2 buildings should be oriented toward the public realm streets squares and plazas in a very deliberate way 3 civic buildings and their primary architectural elements should be placed at the termination of public vistas to provide an appropriate level of visual importance 4 building design & infill standards i 45 building types 100 th e b e a u fo r t  s c o p t e

when a property is important  shall be upheld in all new construction and rehabilitation projects guidelines for determining integrity are as follows a location this is the relationship between the property and its historical context b design this is the combination of elements that create the feeling of a district or structure these elements include building patterns streetscapes site elements building size mass and scale spatial relationships and specific architectural elements and details c setting this is the physical environment of a property and should be evaluated on its context as well as on the historical role the property has played and continues to play important features include topography vegetation manmade features and relationships between existing structures and their surroundings d materials these are the physical elements that make up a property or district e workmanship this is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or time period this particularly applies to rehabilitation projects but for new infill projects workmanship of surrounding structures should be considered and respected retaining the details of the original craft and craftsman ie wood masonry tabby etc of the original building ensures the historic fabric is retained and serves as an important component of the integrity and the patina of age of individual

existing or proposed streets or ways within the city that are targeted for creation expansion or other improvements the official street network plan shall initially consist of a series of four 4 separate maps included in appendix c which shall be deemed a part of the beaufort modification the official street network plan may be modified or supplemented per the procedure for amendments and

plantings  the requirement to install the streetscape elementsshall be waived if those items meet the intent of the prescribed street section even if the existing items do not meet the exact requirements of that street section example scenarios if a street section prescribes an 5 foot sidewalk but a 4 foot sidewalk already exists the existing sidewalk will satisfy the sidewalk requirement however if the street section requires a 5 foot planting strip between the curb and the sidewalk and the 4 foot sidewalk is directly adjacent to the curb this would not satisfy the intent of the street section and would need to be reconstructed per the prescribed standards 2 insufficient rightofway width a in the case of a street section adopted as part of an official map where the width of
