defined between the structures subject to the following for urban areas the minimum height and design of structural works shall be at least three feet above the elevation of the regional flood or at the elevation of the standard project flood whichever is greater modifications and additions to existing structural works shall assure that the work will provide a means of decreasing the flood damage potential in the area any existing structural work which potentially threatens public health or safety shall be modified or reconstructed in order to meet the standards contained in this section within a period of one year of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives ii flood protection elevations and floodway limits which reflect proposed measures for flood control shall not be effective until such measures are constructed and operative unless the proposed measures will increase flood heights in which event the regulatory flood protection elevations and floodplain limits shall reflect the anticipated increases iii detailed plans shall be submitted to the city administrator for any new developments placed on the floodplain landward from dikes and levees the plans must provide for ponding areas or other measures to protect against flooding from internal drainage  procedures and standards for evaluating proposed conditional uses a information required upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a use within the floodplain district the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is in the floodway or the flood fringe area 1 a typical valley cross section showing the

the nature locations dimensions and elevation of the lot contours of the ground fill  storage of materials  floodproofing measures  the arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site  locations and elevations of streets  existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream  soil type and the relationship of the above to the location of the channel 3 profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development b methods used to analyze flood hazard information consistent with standards established by the state department of natural resources shall be used to delineate the general floodplain district the city administrator shall where applicable 1 estimate the discharge of the regional flood which is representative of large floods which are known to have occurred in this region and which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular stream subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to occur on the average of once every 100 years 2 determine the specific flooding threat at the site of the proposed conditional use and determine whether the use is located in a floodway or flood fringe area by a calculation of water surface elevations and flood protection elevations based upon a hydraulic analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood flood protection elevations shall be one foot above the water surface elevations of the regional flood plus the increase in flood heights caused by the proposed development as provided in subsection b2b of this section b computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights to an extent which would cause substantial upstream or downstream damage to existing or reasonably anticipated future development computation of increases in flood heights caused by any encroachment shall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment of both sides of the stream within that reach generally an increase in flood stages attributable to encroachments on the floodplain of any river or stream shall not exceed 05 foot in any one reach or for the cumulative effect of several reaches 3 evaluate the effects of the proposed use upon the public health safety and general welfare in light of the purposes of this chapter and the standards established in this chapter and recommend to the planning commission and city council to deny grant or conditionally grant the application for the proposed use based upon established administrative procedures of this chapter as may be applicable c supplementary considerations in acting upon the conditional use application the city council shall consider all relevant factors specified in section 7491 et seq in addition to the following 1 the danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments 2 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others 3 the proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease contamination and unsanitary conditions 4 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner 5 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community 6 the requirements of the facility for a waterfront location 7 the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use 8 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future 9 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area 10 the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles 11 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site 12 such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter d conditions attached to conditional use permits upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of
