reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  32 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  33 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments  34 the disclosure of certain information by those ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity  35 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter  36 such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health safety peace tranquility and general good order of the community and welfare of the citizens f the united states supreme court and various federal and state courts

applicable united states supreme court and other federal and state court holdings and hereby adopt and incorporate such findings studies evidence experiences and court rulings and holdings herein by reference as if fully set forth verbatim as part of their findings and basis for this chapter and its regulations i adult oriented establishments in proximity to residential areas churches parks and schools may and do often lead to an increase in criminal activities in the surrounding areas and the city desires to protect the youth of the community from the deleterious effects such businesses can have on adjacent areas by restricting their close proximity to places of worship schools and residential areas  and protect its citizens and residents from increased crime ordinance violations such as but not limited to disorderly conduct drinking in public possession of intoxicants by underage persons public disturbances of the peace littering illegal drug use and sales prostitution and gambling j among these secondary effects described in greater detail above are the potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct k the city council of the city of janesville recognize they lack authority to regulate obscenity in light of wis stats  3 and do not intend by adopting this chapter to regulate obscenity since nudity in and of itself is not obscene and declare their intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars taverns and other adult oriented establishments l the city council recognize that the us supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment and the governing body further recognizes that freedom

article b the provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body c the city council hereby designates the director of public works hereafter referred to as the director to administer and enforce the provisions of this article d the requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following 1 wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats  28116 and 28333 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wis admin nr   findings of fact  purpose  intent a the city council acknowledges that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities b the general purpose of this article is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  and control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter 4 minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state c it is the intent of the city council that this article regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this article may be applied on a sitebysite basis the city council recognizes however that the preferred method of

map entitled southern wisconsin regional airport overlay zoning district map rock county wisconsin dated  as amended this airport overlay zoning district map is to be used in conjunction with the southern wisconsin regional airport height zoning map and is made part of this article federal aviation regulations far surfaces and faa runway protection zones rpzs have been utilized to create five individual zones as part of the aozd associated with compatible land use near the southern wisconsin regional airport these districts encompass a threemile radius from the southern wisconsin regional airport property line as authorized by wisconsin statutes  airport overlay zoning district a purpose of airport overlay zoning district the purpose of the aozd is to provide a means of attaining the goals and objectives of the rock county comprehensive plan and the southern wisconsin regional airport master plan airport land use plan andor airport layout plans and to protect a public airport from incompatible uses of land people and property from encroaching into areas where historical and practical experience indicates that conflict will result b airport land use zones the aozd is comprised of five individual zones which include a b1 b2 c and d c zones enforced by this article 1 primary surface the primary surface is the only far part 77 surface that is not specifically used as a land use compatibility zone due to its proximity to the runway environs this surface area must be owned and under the control of the airport the primary surface must be clear of all obstructions except those fixed by their function such as runway edge lights navigational aids or airport signage the primary surface is currently controlled by the southern wisconsin regional airport even though the primary surface is not included as a land use zone it functions as an important safety area since it is longitudinally centered on a runway and is intended to provide an object free area ofa around the runway surface when a runway has a prepared hard surface such as those at the airport the primary surface will extend 200 feet beyond each individual runway end the following primary surface widths are applied to the specific airport runways a runway 1432 1000 feet b runway 0422 1000 feet c runway 1836 250 feet table 1 figure 1 and figure 2 depict various dimensional requirements for the primary surface and other far part 77 surfaces a visual approach runway has relatively small surfaces with approach and horizontal surfaces extending 5000 feet from the primary surface at an approach slope of 20 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically  for a nonprecision approach runway both the approach and horizontal surfaces extend either 5000 or 10000 feet from the primary surface depending on the design category of the runway the approach surfaces for precision approach runways are similar to those for nonprecision approach runways except that the approach surface extends 50000 feet from the primary surface and the horizontal surface extends 10000 feet from the primary surface 2 zone a runway protection zone rpz the dimensional standards for zone a are the same as those described in faa ac 150530013 airport design standards and are illustrated in table 2 and figure 3 3 zone b approach surface zone b is a critical overlay zoning surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at the airport the size of zone b is the combination of zone b1 and b2 and is predicated on the approach type visual nonprecision or precision at a specific runway and the typesize of aircraft utilizing the runway as illustrated in table 3 and figure 4 a portion of zone b1 is superseded by zone a because the approach surface and rpz overlap the entire length of the rpz consequently the length of zone b1 begins at the inner edge of the rpz and continues to onehalf the length of the approach surface beyond zone a zone b2 is also equal to onehalf the length of zone b beyond zone b1 and is located at the outer edge of the zone 4 zone c transitional surface the areas within zone c are those that extend 1050 feet outward from the edge of the primary surface paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline with zone b1 to a length equal to the outer edge of zone a and then squared to meet zone a as shown in the table 3 and figure 4 5 zone d threemile jurisdictional boundary zone d encompasses the horizontal innermost area and conical surface outermost area of the far part 77 surfaces all of which represent the threemile jurisdictional boundary as provided for within wisconsin statutes table 3 and figure 4 zone d is calculated by intersecting a series of three threemile arcs drawn from the outermost property
