division 1  generally purpose and findings a purpose it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the town council and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the town council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 1985  and 253448  8 the following data are summarized from the cdc semiannual hivaids surveillance report numbers are based on aids cases reported to cdc  the cumulative number of aids cases reported to cdc is 733374 adult and adolescent aids cases total 724656 with 604843 cases in males and 119810 cases in females through the same time period 8718 aids cases were reported in children under age 13 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in the united states 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 500000 cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections 1 15 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 23 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 24

design the provisions of article vi of this chapter permit reduction of certain lot size standards  302   residential density residential density shall not exceed the requirements of this section residential density is measured by the number of residential units per acre 1 purpose control of residential density is an important component in addressing many of the general purposes of this chapter including lessening vehicle congestion in the streets preventing overcrowding of land avoiding undue concentration of population facilitating adequate provision of public facilities utilities and services assuring proper use of natural resources and contributing to community character and quality neighborhoods 2 maximum residential density the maximum residential density in each district is specified in the dimensions table 3 open space design the provisions of article vi of this chapter do not permit an increase of residential density the standards for residential density shall apply regardless of the pattern of development  303   setbacks structures shall be set back from property lines in conformance with the minimum and maximum setback requirements set forth in this section 1 purpose control of setbacks is important for a variety of reasons the proximity of a structure to a road affects the character of the neighborhood encourages or discourages pedestrian activity and may block site distance for cars at an intersection or driveway the proximity of a structure to abutting lots affects fire safety the provision of adequate sunlight and air circulation for this and neighboring lots and structures and the availability of space for site amenities such as landscaping driveways and so forth in this chapter maximum setbacks are required in certain instances while the minimum is applied in most communities the maximum setback is still unusual and warrants further explanation the maximum setback is applied in the village area where it is highly desirable to site the buildings close to the sidewalks and streets the resulting built environment provides for a visually consistent streetscape and enhances the pedestrian character of the village by forcing the buildings to be close to the sidewalks and preventing onsite parking in front of the buildings 2 structure setbacks minimum and maximum setbacks from roads and other property boundaries are specified in the dimensions table maximum setbacks shall not apply to accessory structures 3 open space design the provisions of article vi of this chapter may permit reduction of certain setback standards 4 special exceptions a the zoning board of adjustment can relax the maximum setback in the m2 district to a maximum of 25 feet by granting a special exception when the following condition is met 1 the area within the front setback will be used for outdoor restaurant seating retail display or other active use associated with the permitted use in no case shall parking be permitted within the front setback b in cases where the setback requirements have changed since a subdivision was approved and where the current requirements are more restrictive than those in effect at the time of the subdivision approval the zoning board of adjustment may reduce the current setback requirement to that permitted at the time of the subdivision approval by granting of a special exception the zoning board of adjustment shall grant a special exception when the following conditions are met 1 application of the current setback standards would render the lot unbuildable  or 2 the zoning board of adjustment determines that the former setback requirements are sufficient to secure the purposes of this section  304   structure height structure heights shall not be less than the minimum nor more than the maximum requirements set forth in this section 1 purpose control of structure height is important for a variety of reasons structure height is related to fire safety and the fire departments ability to protect public safety however there are other important issues beyond the immediate safety issue structure height strongly affects the character of the neighborhood and the allowance of adequate sunlight and air circulation it is a critical control of intensity of use especially for nonresidential uses in this chapter both minimum and maximum structure heights are required in certain instances while the maximum is applied in many communities the minimum requirement is unusual and warrants further explanation the minimum height requirement is applied in the m2 district where it is highly desirable to maintain a relatively consistent visual facade of tall buildings along the village streets most buildings will have multiple stories providing lower rent commercial or residential space over the more desirable street level space other buildings especially those which serve a civic function such as churches are suitably tall even without the multiple stories so there is no restriction on the number of stories 2 structure height both minimum and maximum structure heights are specified in the dimensions table maximum structure height shall apply to all structures but minimum structure height shall apply only to primary structures and not to accessory structures 3 open space design the provisions of article vi of this chapter do not permit alteration of structure height requirements the standards for structure height shall apply regardless of the pattern of development 4 special exception the zoning board of adjustment can relax the maximum structure height limit to a maximum of 60 feet by granting a special exception when the following conditions are met a the proposed structure which exceeds the height limit must exceed the height limit to fulfill its unique purpose such as an agricultural silo church steeple or a communications antenna b there shall be no occupied floor space above the standard height limit  305   dimensions table the following

wetland protection overlay district a purpose wetlands are a critical natural resource that affect water quality flooding wildlife recreation and aesthetics and their protection is a goal of the master plan wetlands protect surface water quality by reducing the speed of surface water runoff allowing for the deposit of sediment and nutrients wetlands protect shorelines from erosion wetlands absorb water during times of flooding thus helping to reduce floodwater elevations wetlands help to maintain the quality of groundwater recharge wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including fish birds deer other animals wetlands contribute to a broad range of recreational opportunities including canoeing hunting fishing and bird watching wetlands contribute to the aesthetic values of the town providing for open space natural vistas landform contrasts and early autumn foliage these purposes in combination with the fact that wetlands are often illsuited to development

rockingham county  7 an analysis of equalized valuation per capita prepared by the nh office of state planning for years 198 1990 and 1999 indicates that newmarkets equalized valuation per capita was 30 to 40 percent lower than the state average in those comparison years  8 in the absence of impact fees anticipated residential and nonresidential growth and associated capital improvement costs will likely necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds in order to maintain adequate public capital facility standards and to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare  9 impact

regulation the board seeks to balance the process of growth development and change with the need to protect and enhance those qualities which make newmarket a safe and desirable place to live work and visit in keeping with this general purpose the following are specific objectives a provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health safety or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply drainage transportation schools fire protection or other public services or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services  b provide for the harmonious development and redevelopment of the town and its environs  c provide adequate and coordinated open space neighborhood parks and other recreation areas with adequate public access  d provide for proper spacing and patterns of properties and buildings to ensure adequate sunlight and air circulation access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings and establishment of land use patterns compatible with traditional new england design especially in new residential neighborhoods  e ensure that land is of sufficient character to be used for building purposes without danger to health and additionally ensuring that development does not exceed the capability of the land to safely provide onsite water supply and sewage disposal in areas not served by municipal water and sewer systems  f facilitate adequate provision of public facilities utilities and services  and g require proper arrangement design and construction of streets sidewalks pedestrian and bicycle paths and other transportation improvements to compose a safe convenient and environmentally compatible system of vehicular and pedestrian travel which integrates with

this new regulation on  definitions definitions shall be those provided in the newmarket zoning  in zoning 11 and the additional definitions as follows best management practices bmp as outlined in the nhdes stormwater manual vols 13 published in dec 2008 or as amended best management practices are generally considered to be the most effective and practical means of preventing soil erosion andor controlling peak flow rates as well as minimizing pollutant loads and runoff volumes generated from site development these may include both structural and nonstructural measures associated with site development bioretention area also often referred to as a rain garden consists of a shallow landscaped depression that receives runoff from impervious surfaces and allows the initial firstflush of runoff typically first one inch of runoff to infiltrate into native soils or an engineered soil matrix for water quality treatment these areas are generally planted with a mix of native grasses sedges and shrubs boundary line adjustment 1 the alteration of lot boundaries between two or more adjoining lots which does not increase the number of lots 2 the creation of a different form or division of ownership of an existing property which does not require physical changes disturbance any activity that involves altering the existing terrain which includes clearing and grubbing grading and adding impervious area that will change the runoff flow and volume from an existing site impervious surface any surface that cannot effectively infiltrate rainfall including but not limited to surfaces such as building rooftops pavement sidewalks driveways and compacted gravel eg driveways and parking lots low impact development lid low impact development is a site planning and design strategy intended to maintain or replicate predevelopment hydrology use of site planning source control and small scale practices integrated throughout the site to capture and infiltrate runoff as close to its source as possible where existing soils limit the natural infiltration potential lid strategies may include but not be limited to preserving existing wooded buffer areas use of cisterns to capture and reuse stormwater or the use of roof gardens to minimize the generation of roof runoff major subdivision 1 the division of a lot into a greater number of lots but which does not fit the definition of a minor subdivision 2 an increase in the number of residential units on a single lot but which does not fit the definition of a minor subdivision maximum extent practicable mep to show that a proposed development has met a standard to the maximum extent practicable the applicant must demonstrate the following 1 all reasonable efforts have been made to meet the standard 2 a complete evaluation of all possible management measures has been performed and 3 if full compliance cannot be achieved the highest practicable level of management is being implemented minor subdivision 1 the division of a lot into a greater number of lots provided that no new road is required  that there is no potential for a road to be required for the full development of any remaining developable portion of the land  and that the resulting number of lots does not exceed six 2 an increase in the number of residential units on a single lot provided that the total proposed number of such units does not exceed six subdivision division of a lot into two or more lots plats sites or other divisions of land for the purpose whether immediate or future of sale rent lease condominium conveyance or building development it includes resubdivision and where appropriate to the context relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or territory subdivided the division of a parcel of land held in common and subsequently divided into parts among several owners shall be deemed a subdivision the granting of an easement in gross for public utilities shall not be deemed a subdivision communications between town and applicant there are many people involved in the processing of each application and communication problems develop quickly if great care is not taken from the start to prevent communication problems from developing it is important for both the town and the applicant to designate one person each to coordinate all communications this prevents repetition of questions prevents two people from giving different answers to the same question and should help to keep interpretation consistent a applicants authorized representative the application form requires designation of one person to act as the authorized representative all communication to the applicant shall be made person and this person shall be present at all meetings with the board in the text of this regulation references to the applicant shall also imply the authorized representative b town 1 all communications to the town shall be directed to the planning board secretary unless otherwise directed by the chairman of the board this may be common during larger applications such as when an engineer reviewing the road design needs to talk to the design engineer to clarify issues 2 individual board members shall not discuss the application with the applicant abutters or any other person associated or affected by the application except at the board meetings which may include formal site visits with the applicant otherwise all questions should be directed to the planning board secretary this procedure is essential to ensure that all board members and the public receive the same information about the application and that all board members are therefore equally able to render the best decision possible applicability these regulations cover the following types of activities a lot consolidation pursuant to rsa a the combination of two or more lots under common ownership to form a single lot requires that the board approve sign and record at the rockingham county registry of deeds a notice of merger a copy shall also be provided to the town assessor the board shall approve the merger so long as it does not create or worsen existing violations of the land use codes to obtain the boards approval this item must be placed on the agenda of a regular meeting of the board no public hearing or abutter notice is required all costs shall be paid by the lot owner b subdivisions this regulation provides for three different types of applications each with its own specific requirements 1 boundary line adjustment the alteration of lot boundaries between two or more adjoining lots which does not increase the number of lots  or the creation of a different form or division of ownership of an existing property which does not require physical changes further information and instructions are provided in 2 minor subdivision this can be either of two types of proposal first the division of a lot into a greater number of lots provided that no new road is required  that there is no potential for a road to be required for the full development of any remaining developable portion of land within the original lot  and that the resulting number of lots does not exceed six second an increase in the number of residential units on a single lot provided that the total proposed number of such units does not exceed six further information and instructions are provided in 3 major subdivision this can be either of two types of proposal first the division of a lot into a greater number of lots but which does not fit the definition of a minor subdivision second an increase in the number of residential units on a single lot but which does not fit the definition of a minor subdivision further information and instructions are provided in about town regulations a related town codes the town of newmarket has other regulations which may affect an application as follows planning board bylaws conservation commission bylaws zoning board of adjustment bylaws zoning v subdivision regulations site plan review regulations excavation regulations b organization and cross references to fully understand this code it is important to understand how this regulation is organized and cross referenced 1 organization of this regulation a regulation is divided into six simply a grouping of related issues or requirements and readers should identify the article in which an answer is likely to be found the six sections are  100 general provisions  200 application procedures  300 design standards  400 plat standards  500 administration  600 application forms and checklists b subsections each divided into subsections each of which may be further divided as needed it is easiest to use the table of contents to locate the major subsections 2 cross referencing system within this regulation there are many references to other this code these cross references are provided to help the reader find needed information and to inform the reader of related provisions the reference for this general provisions written as follows  100 the symbol  means section in all cases the information following the  starts with the then the subsections in descending order the reference for this subsection is written as follows  106b2 the number to the left of the decimal point refers to the the number following the decimal point is the subsection and so forth additional levels of hierarchy would be shown as follows  101b3ce the reader should note that only the first letter is capitalized and that the rounded parentheses are used before the square parentheses also the text of each level is indented farther than the previous level c shallshould the term shall requires a mandatory action in all cases while should implies that the action is appropriate in most cases the board is responsible for deciding on a casebycase basis how to apply the should provisions d state laws state laws are referenced frequently in this regulation in new hampshire state laws are known as revised statutes annotated which is abbreviated as rsa and are followed by the appropriate chapter and section references editors note the organization of the other regulations listed in subsection a of this section is no longer accurate as it was changed as part of the recodification process general guidance the following advice is offered to assist the applicant especially if the applicant is unfamiliar with land development processes a all applicants will need to hire professionals to prepare part or all of the application in all cases a nh licensed land surveyor is required in some cases other specialists will be needed possibly including a licensed professional engineer an attorney a soil scientist or others while such assistance does cost money their skills and abilities are essential to ensure that the town and applicant have sound information on which to base their decisions b the board is concerned about processing all applications fairly and quickly to accomplish this the applicant shares certain responsibilities the applicant must be properly prepared this includes reading these regulations to understand the issues which must be addressed and includes dealing with all the significant issues up front incomplete submittals or failure to properly address issues will result in unnecessary delays in obtaining a final decision from the board c the application process is similar for all applications although the amount of work and time to obtain an approval vary widely 1 all applications follow this basic process  preparation the applicant prepares the application usually done by hired professionals this may involve some discussion with the board consultation or design review meetings  application acceptance upon submittal of the application materials to the town the application is placed on the next available planning board agenda for consideration by state law there is a minimum leadtime of 15 days  scattered and premature the board may make certain findings that a proposed development is scattered and premature which may lead to modification of the application or could result in denial  road layout for major subdivisions only the board requires extra meetings to discuss road layout and function before it will accept or review final road design plans this permits transportation issues to be discussed conceptually before the exact details of specific designs are developed  public hearing all applications will have a public hearing this is the official opportunity for the public to ask questions about the application to raise issues offer suggestions or indicate their support or opposition the hearing may be interspersed with periods of deliberation by the board and may be continued to future dates  decision in the end the board must decide whether to approve or deny the application in the majority of cases the board approves the application with conditions which means that there are additional administrative or technical requirements which must be satisfied to obtain the full approval 2 timing perhaps the most commonly asked question about an application to a planning board is how long will it take there is no standard answer at a minimum there must be a meeting with the board and this alone requires at least 15 days leadtime boundary line adjustments and minor subdivisions are often approved at a single meeting major subdivisions however require a minimum of two meetings and are likely to take two to three months to complete however this general answer is all based on the assumptions that the applicant is properly prepared and that no unusual circumstances arise without the applicants consent however it is very unlikely that an application process can take longer than six months application process preliminary conceptual consultation this meeting shall be directed at a review of the basic concept of the proposal and suggestions which might be of assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirements during final consideration the board and applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form only and in general terms such as desirability of types of development and proposals under the master plan the presentation to the board of new surveys engineering plans or similar materials shall require the design review process to be followed so the chairman must be careful to keep these discussions at a general level typically maps from the master plan tax maps county soil survey maps and the like are acceptable levels of generality upon which to base these discussions such consultation shall not bind either the applicant or the board and statements made by board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating

governmental entity to be considered an abutter for purposes of offering testimony and computing public notice fees application acceptance before an application is reviewed by the board it must be accepted by a formal vote of the board the applicant shall attend this meeting to ensure that questions can be answered and issues clarified as necessary per rsa ib the board shall vote to accept the application only if determines that the application is complete per this regulation upon acceptance review of the application may proceed if an application is not accepted the board may proceed with design review discussions per  202 the design review meeting may be continued to another date and time for application acceptance without further public notice applicants presentation following application acceptance the applicant shall make a brief general presentation to the board and audience this presentation should include a brief description of the proposed project and a general description of the design layout and so forth the applicant may list specific issues of concern which they would like the board to discuss during deliberations but this forum is only intended to ensure general familiarity with the application the applicant is solely responsible for bringing any audiovisual materials or equipment needed the chairman shall have sole authority to limit the time taken for this presentation to keep the meeting moving and applicants should plan on 10 minutes or less for most applications for applications which are reviewed over a series of meetings this presentation may be appropriate at the beginning of each session public hearing the board shall open a public hearing following application acceptance and the applicants presentation the purpose shall be to solicit public input comments questions and concerns the chairman may temporarily suspend public comment during the public hearing so that the board may deliberate vote of waivers and so forth the public hearing may be continued if additional meetings are necessary provided that the board follows the continuation procedures specified in  210e only when all pertinent new public input is complete shall the chairman close the public hearing the applicant shall be responsible for attending the public hearing including all continuations to ensure that questions can be answered and issues clarified as needed deliberation the board shall deliberate as necessary to determine the appropriate decision the deliberation does not necessarily follow the public hearing and may be interspersed with the public hearing or may occur prior to the public hearing this is the appropriate forum for the applicant and board to discuss specific issues the board should keep in mind however the purpose of the public hearing and therefore should generally defer decisions until after relevant public input is received intermediate decisions deliberations for each application will be unique but there are several intermediate decisions which may be particularly applicable in certain cases a major subdivision road function and layout for major subdivision applications only the board shall first review the general function and layout of the proposed or potential roads on the entire property final plans for major subdivisions should not be prepared until after this review has taken place 1 purpose the importance of this step cannot be understated establishing the layout of roads and property boundaries has an important impact on the character and function of the community roads can detract from the neighborhood or they can enhance it traffic circulation and safety can be enhanced or impaired in the neighborhood and in affected surrounding areas new development can relate in a positive or negative manner to the existing developments nearby among the most influential and long lasting determinants of these functions are the establishment of the road network and property boundaries and for this reason the general proposal should be reviewed and generally approved before further details are worked out 2 this decision shall be based on the boards initial opinion regarding the proposal with respect to the road design objectives described in  302a including traffic function road layout scale and aesthetics of particular importance at this point of the review is an assessment of the general pattern of the road network how well it fits into and connects with the adjacent road network how the road design will affect its traffic functions how the road design fits into the features of the site and how the transportation functions will relate to the land use functions when the site is fully developed 3 if the applicant so chooses this discussion and a tentative decision can occur during a design review meeting per  202 the decision of the board must be confirmed following application acceptance since the design review is nonbinding by state law the advantage to using the design review process for this purpose would be to permit the applicant to receive feedback on the general road plan prior to investing time and money in the final design hopefully resulting in monetary savings and quicker approval of the application if the design review meeting is not used for this purpose the board shall not review and approve a major subdivision application in one meeting it shall proceed intermediate decision and shall continue the discussion of the details to a later meeting prior to discussing any other details pertaining to roads or lots b scattered or premature development the board may deny an application if it determines that the proposed development would be scattered or premature if the board is considering denial of an application on this ground it shall first determine by majority vote that the application if approved would be scattered or premature by virtue of one or more the reasons listed in  101a and rsa iia in making this determination the board shall specify the exact nature of its concerns prior to denying an application on this basis the board shall provide the applicant if the applicant is agreeable with sufficient time to determine whether or not there is any reasonable way to modify the proposal or to directly mitigate the adverse impacts in a manner such that the proposal would no longer be considered scattered or premature decision pursuant to rsa ic the board shall issue a decision within 90 days of application acceptance subject to time extensions as per rsa if applications which are not accepted require no decision the board must approve conditionally approve or disapprove the application as follows a approval the board shall grant approval to an application when it fully complies with the standards and processes of this regulation and other applicable law b conditional approval the board may grant conditional approval to an application when minor additional action by the applicant will bring the application into full compliance for approval this may include the posting of financial securities payment of fees minor changes in design and other matters subject to the requirements of  217c2 and rsa ii these statuary requirements are summarized as follows 1 minor plan changes whether or not imposed by the board as a result of a public hearing compliance with which is administrative and which does not involve discretionary judgment  or 2 conditions which are in themselves administrative and which involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the board  or 3 conditions with regard to the applicants possession of permits and approvals granted by other governmental units c disapproval the board shall disapprove an application when it fails to comply with the standards andor procedures of this regulation for failure to meet reasonable deadlines established by the board or for failure to pay fees 1 if the board includes the phrase without prejudice in the motion to disapprove it signifies that the application was denied solely for procedural reasons and that it may be resubmitted to the board at a later date without design changes but shall be subject to the codes in effect at the time of the new application applications disapproved without this stipulation shall not be considered again by the board unless the applicant demonstrates that there have been design changes or changes in regulations affecting the application 2 conditional approvals shall be valid for a period of not more than six months if the conditions of the approval have not been satisfied within this time the conditional approval shall automatically lapse the planning board may grant a single sixmonth extension to accommodate unusual circumstances but the applicant is required to provide a written request for extension to the board before the expiration date the board shall consider the request at its next regular meeting and such action shall not require a public hearing notice of decision as required by rsa  within 72 hours of the meeting the board shall issue a notice of decision which states the final decision reached by the board regarding the application a in the case of a conditional approval the notice of decision shall state all conditions to be met for final approval 1 in the event that the conditions are satisfied the board shall issue a supplemental notice of decision stating that the application is approved since all conditions have been satisfied and shall sign and record the plats if applicable 2 in the event that the conditions are not satisfied the board shall issue a supplemental notice of decision stating that the application is denied for failure to comply with the conditions of approval in a timely manner b in the case of a disapproval the notice of decision shall state the reasons for denial as required by rsa ih and rsa i appeals any person aggrieved by any decision made in the course of applications pursuant to this chapter may appeal as follows a decisions by the planning board based solely upon interpretation of the zoning be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment or rockingham superior court per the provisions of rsa iii appeals to the zba must be filed within 20 days and appeals made to superior court must be filed within 30 days b all other decisions by the planning board may be appealed to rockingham county superior court per the provisions of rsa  there is a 30day time limit in which to make an appeal c the time limit for appeals begins on the day on which the planning board decision is filed and first becomes available for public inspection per  218 this should occur within 72 hours of the boards decision revocation of approval the board may act to revoke an approval per the requirements of rsa a design standards character of the land the board shall consider the physical character of the land involved including soils types slopes drainage characteristics exposure to sunlight and wind wildlife habitat potential views and other such characteristics in determining what action to take with respect to the application a an application to subdivide land of such character that it cannot in the judgment of the board be safely used for the proposed purposes because of danger to public health or safety shall not be approved b where the character of the land is not adequately considered the board may require modification of the application to enhance the function and quality of the development or to reduce adverse impacts resulting from the development c contain contiguous areas of developable land such that the driveway building water supply and sewage disposal and other improvements can be constructed without filling of wetlands or other such adverse impacts which could be eliminated by different subdivision design the number of lots may be reduced by the board to reduce adverse impacts the board shall have the authority to require design changes to minimize impacts regardless of the actions of other local or state permitting actions such as the issuance of a permit to fill wetlands for a driveway crossing d site lot lines shall generally be at right angles or radial to street lines roads this section represents a compilation of sources on this complex and important subject among the sources are residential street design and traffic control by homburger deakin et al  institute of transportation engineers prentice hall englewood cliffs nj 1989 and neotraditional neighborhood design and its implications for traffic engineers by eva lernerlam stephen p celniker gary w halbert chester rick chellman and sherry ryan compendium of technical papers 61st annual meeting of the institute of transportation engineers 1991 some of the text of this section is quoted from these sources but there has been no attempt to provide specific quotations the understanding of these authors is greatly appreciated by the town of newmarket a design objectives before road design can be addressed the towns design objectives must be laid out as clearly as possible so that the design professionals can understand what is expected of them and to develop a better understanding of the multiple demands placed on road design first and foremost roads must be recognized as complex public spaces which accommodate and impact traffic parking pedestrians bicyclists and aesthetics among other things road design objectives are further categorized and specified as follows 1 traffic function roads must accommodate safe access to properties convenient and efficient pickups and deliveries emergency access maintenance services and other such uses the overall road system should provide for sufficient number and layout of collectors and arterials to handle flow as one means of protecting local residential streets from further local residential streets shall be linked to traffic carrying streets in a way that simultaneously provides good access to other parts of the community and region and minimizes the chances of residential streets use by further residential streets should be protected from vehicles moving at excessive speeds typically greater than 25 to 30 mph the design engineer is challenged to balance this last provision against rsa ii which dictates higher speed limits in most cases proper access management is essential in protecting the traffic capacity of arterial roads 2 road layout the general layout of roads shall be a regular interconnected geometric angular as opposed to curvilinear pattern so that there are alternative routes to most if not all destinations the layout of proposed roads shall provide for the continuation of the principal streets in adjoining areas if applicable the number of permanent culdesacs shall be minimized suitable connections and reservation for future connections to remaining lands and adjacent lots shall be provided layout geometry shall be designed to take advantage of the topography and proposed future development patterns creating vista terminations and improving the view of and the view from buildings and other prominent vistas layout shall also be carefully designed to avoid creation of a situation where the local road is used for flow 3 scale the scaling of the facility must facilitate the appropriate level of sharing of road use among cars walkers bicycles emergency vehicles and others the final product shall permit comfortable and safe pedestrian and bicycle movements as well as motorized vehicular movements and shall protect vulnerable users such as children the disabled and the elderly 4 aesthetics road design should enhance the overall aesthetics of the neighborhood designed street layout and landscaping additionally recreation areas in the form of commons or public squares should be used as focal points and vista terminations aesthetics must be achieved thoughtful integration of all aspects of design and cannot simply be added on to a design 5 quality construction regardless of the outcome of the more policyoriented layout and function issues of the road system the construction of roads shall be of high quality roads shall be constructed to standards suitable for the climate the environment in which they are built and for the proposed use the resulting road should require a minimal amount of maintenance for quite many years 6 stormwater management the road design and other associated lot development shall include adequate stormwater management provisions that meet requirements specified in  303 of these regulations the use of permeable asphalt or concrete is encouraged wherever appropriate to minimize increases in runoff volume and peak flow rates leaving the site b design standards although it is the intent of these regulations to provide design parameters to guide overall design it is the responsibility of the engineer designing the road to apply her or his professional expertise in creating the design additionally the town shall have another engineer review the design for compliance with the purposes and controls of this regulation as well as with accepted engineering practices it should be noted that the board expects to create only local roads and that more suitable standards for design and construction shall be required for collectors and arterials should such functions be proposed or expected 1 design speed of local roads shall be 30 mph this may be altered where necessary to comply with rsa iic except that 30 mph shall be the maximum design

provided herein driveway locations shall not be specified on the subdivision plan but the sight distances along the frontage shall be protected safe stopping and intersection sight distances shall meet or exceed the standards specified in the transportation and traffic engineering handbook ite second edition prenticehall englewood cliffs nj 198 pp 5903 a for access onto state highways driveway location consistent with the state driveway permit shall be shown b for subdivisions fronting on arterial roads the number of driveway accesses onto the arterial road shall be minimized  access onto

road 7 no point along a road centerline shall be more than 1000 from a single point of access in the road network this requirement is similar to a maximum culdesac length standard but applies more broadly to the culdesac and the adjacent road network 8 roads shall intersect at 90 degrees plus or minus 15 degrees 9 other safety provisions may be required if appropriate including but not limited to curbing and guardrails 10 the designer shall prepare a report which documents how the proposed design complies with the design objectives listed in  302a this report may be included as part of the stormwater management and erosion control report as required by  303 of these regulations c property issues 1 the minimum width of any road rightofway shall be 50 a larger width may be required where conditions warrant additionally flairs or curve radii may be required at intersections where such provisions would be beneficial 2 reserve strips which restrict access to the rightofway from adjacent lots or roads shall be prohibited 3 easements for cut and fill slopes drainage water lines sewer lines and other such improvements shall be provided as appropriate 4 the application shall specify ownership and responsibility for maintenance of the rightofway and all improvements therein subdivision approval in no way implies town acceptance of any road or rightofway and in no way obligates the town in any future consideration of such acceptance d construction 1 only that portion of the rightofway shall be cleared and grubbed as is necessary to meet safety requirements where possible

virtually every construction project the board acknowledges that such changes will be necessary from time to time and authorizes the inspecting engineer representing the town to exercise hisher professional judgment in making such changes and asks that the engineer to document such changes and remain consistent with the purposes of this regulation and this making their judgment e traffic

historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this ordinance diversity and originality in layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas accordingly the planning board shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed preliminary plan 1 protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the town as part of the application 2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating houselots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions a where significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as determined by the board in accordance with intent of the ordinance b the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat 3 if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside stone wall 4 maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of a depth sufficient to protect and maintain the ecological stability of adjacent wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds the sufficiency of a buffer shall be set at 100 feet unless waived by the planning board the waiver request shall be completed by a qualified environmental professional using the guidance

existing stonewalls between fields or meadows and minimizes impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive vines also woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should be avoided however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable 6 leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public thoroughfares for example in open agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along public roads where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant the concept of foreground meadows with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse works is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips with or without berms or vegetative screening in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be provided to preserve existing vegetation 7 avoids the concentrated siting of new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features 8 protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by

roadways shall be designed in accordance with the newmarket subdivision regulations 2 connectivity it is the intent of this ordinance that most open space design developments do not include provisions for connectivity of roadways where the majority of house sites are located if connectivity is desired by the board for future development purposes andor reasons of health and safety the board may require secondary roads to serve the house sites and encourage the use of separate connector roads to serve as the mode of interconnectivity 3 design flexibility the board shall consider greater flexibility in specific adherence to design requirements related to curve and tangent requirements pavement width rightofway width and clearing requirements this flexibility shall be exercised in the pursuit of site design that minimizes impacts to the site and provides flexibility in siting dwellings e procedures for conservation subdivisions process overview the sequence of actions prescribed in this article  is as listed below these steps shall be followed sequentially and may be combined only at the discretion of the planning commission 1 preapplication discussion technical review 2

review 7 decision 1 preapplication discussion a preapplication discussion is strongly encouraged between the applicant the site designers and members of the planning board the purpose of this informal meeting is to introduce the applicant and the site designers to the regulations and procedures and to discuss the applicants objectives in relation to the town requirements the town may designate a consultant experienced in development design and in the protection of natural features and greenway lands to meet with the applicant and to attend meetings as authorized under these regulations and rsa  2 environmental resource and yield plan submittal at the preapplication discussion the applicant shall submit the yield equation and environmental resource yield plan for technical review the submissions shall not be required to meet engineering specifications or surveying standards for purposes of the yield plan  however the environmental characteristics of the site shall be determined and delineated in accordance with applicable professional standards a environmental resource and yield plan the application shall include a sketch plan showing the delineation of environmental resources on the site and the maximum number of dwelling units that would be reasonably achievable under the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations for a conventional design consistent with the minimum lot size lot widths set backs and all other applicable provisions purposes and objectives of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations in place at the time of the submission and compare it to the number of dwelling units proposed this plan is intended to utilize required design information for the open space application and overlay a sketched conventional subdivision at a minimum the following information shall be provided i property boundaries  ii streams rivers lakes wetlands as defined in this ordinance and associated zoning buffers  iii topographic contours at 2foot intervals  iv general vegetation characteristics  v general soil types showing with reasonable certainty the ability to provide onsite septic facilities if not on public sewer service  vi a sketch of lot lines

structures  xi reserved  xii existing abutting conservation land and trails  xiii waivers that would be required for approval and statement of justification for the waiver under the relevant provision of the applicable subdivision regulation  xiv wetland impacts that would be required for conventional design b development yield equation the maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning district in making this calculation the following shall apply to the developable land base as required by  603e i a 10% reduction in the developable land base to account for public facilities roads drainage and utility easements  ii a complete removal of all land on the parcel that has been set aside from development

wetlands over 6000 square feet of impact to very poorly drained soils over 12000 square feet in impact to poorly drained soils or an aggregate of over 1 one acre in impact to wetlands of any types in the entire project c delineation of open space and the developable land base the calculation of the developable land base as required by  603 and reviewed under  606c3 of the newmarket zoning the baseline for the open space calculations this calculation is meant to be a numerical calculation that relates to an actual physical description of the area of the parcel to be protected as open space the area of the parcel that is to be set aside must meet the minimum requirements of the developable land base calculations as a practical matter the open space will likely be larger given the inclusion of wetlands in the final parcel the calculation insures that adequate uplands and developable land is set aside to further the multiple purposes of the open space design ordinance 3 yield equation and yield plan review and recommendation the planning department shall use the environmental resource and yield plan and yield equation submission to make a recommendation on the validity of

restricted open space using the location criteria contained in the open space design b location of house sites during the second step potential house sites are tentatively located because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the evaluation criteria contained above subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the preliminary plan c street and lot layout the third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way when lots and access streets are laid out they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on the conservation areas to the greatest extent practicable wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly discouraged street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new culdesacs to be maintained by the town and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property where culdesacs are necessary those serving six or fewer homes may be designed with hammerheads facilitating threepoint turns culdesacs serving more than six homes shall generally be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs either conserved on site or planted in situations where more formal neotraditional or villagetype layouts are proposed steps two and three may be reversed so that the location of house sites follows the location of streets and squares d lot lines the fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines where applicable these are generally drawn midway between house locations and may include lshaped flaglots 7 decisions for each preliminary step the decision shall be in the form of a vote decisions that are made on limited submission of information as contemplated by this development approach shall not be binding if

system of headings and catchlines has been used additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets state law reference site plans rsa  et seq general provisions purpose the general purpose of this regulation is to guide the character of nonresidential and multifamily development redevelopment expansion and change of use in order to implement the policies of the master plan providing for the public health safety convenience prosperity and general welfare throughout this regulation the board seeks to balance the process of growth development and change with the need to preserve and enhance those qualities which make newmarket a safe and desirable place to live work and visit in keeping with this general purpose the following are specific objectives a promote the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the town ensuring visual harmony of the sites with their surrounding neighborhoods establishing site designs consistent with andor complimentary to traditional new england designs providing adequate green space and open space providing for proper building location to ensure adequate sunlight and air circulation and protecting the natural beauty of the town  b enhance the downtown village area and waterfront by providing an appropriate mix of uses improving appearance maintaining traditional new england character enhancing pedestrian orientation and promoting mixed use mill redevelopment  c protect the public from undue hazards disturbances and nuisances  d promote commercial development including opportunity for homebased work to broaden the tax base and employ residents  e protect environmental quality by means of controlling sediment erosion and increases in runoff volumes and discharges of nonpoint source pollution  f ensure that land is of sufficient character to be used for building purposes without danger to health and additionally ensuring that development does not exceed the capability of the land to safely provide onsite water supply and sewage disposal in areas not served by municipal water and sewer systems  g guard against such conditions as would involve danger or injury to health safety or prosperity by reason any one or more of the following 1 inadequate stormwater management  2 conditions conducive to flooding  3 inadequate protection to preserve the quality of groundwater and surface water resources  4 undesirable and preventable elements of pollution such as noise smoke soot particulates or any other discharge into the environment which might prove harmful to persons structures or adjacent or neighboring properties 5 inadequate provision of fire safety prevention and control  h facilitate adequate provision of public facilities utilities and services  and i provide for adequate transportation by requiring appropriate provision and arrangement of roads driveways sidewalks traffic aisles parking loading areas bicycle facilities emergency vehicle accesses transit amenities and offsite connections while minimizing the creation of additional impervious surfaces authority under authority of rsa  and authorization from town meeting as amended the planning board repeals the previous site plan review regulations and hereby adopts this new regulation on  definitions definitions shall be those provided in the newmarket zoning  in zoning 11 section 3211 of the  and the additional definitions as follows best management practices bmp as outlined in the nhdes stormwater manual vols 13 published in dec 2008 or as amended bmps are generally considered to be the most effective and practical means of preventing soil erosion andor controlling peak flow rates as well as minimizing pollutant loads and runoff volumes generated from site development these may include both structural and nonstructural measures associated with site development bioretention area also often referred to as a rain garden consists of a shallow landscaped depression that receives runoff from impervious surfaces and allows the initial firstflush of runoff typically first 1 inch of runoff to infiltrate into native soils or an engineered soil matrix for water quality treatment these areas are generally planted with a mix of native grasses sedges and shrubs disturbance any activity that involves altering the existing terrain which includes clearing and grubbing grading and adding impervious area that will change the runoff flow and volume from an existing site impervious surface any surface that cannot effectively infiltrate rainfall and consist of surfaces such as building rooftops pavement sidewalks driveways and compacted gravel eg driveways and parking lots low impact development lid low impact development is a site planning and design strategy intended to maintain or replicate predevelopment hydrology use of site planning source control and small scale practices integrated throughout the site to capture and infiltrate runoff as close to its source as possible where existing soils limit the natural infiltration potential lid strategies may include but not be limited to preserving existing wooded buffer areas use of cisterns to capture and reuse stormwater or the use of roof gardens to minimize the generation of roof runoff maximum extent practicable mep to show that a proposed development has met a standard to the maximum extent practicable the applicant must demonstrate the following 1 all reasonable efforts have been made to meet the standard  2 a complete evaluation of all possible management measures has been performed  and 3 if full compliance cannot be achieved the highest practicable level of management is being implemented redevelopment any construction alteration or improvement that disturbs more than 20000 square feet of area or adds more than 5000 square feet of impervious area on an existing developed parcel this definition of redevelopment only pertains to the stormwater management and sediment requirements of communications between town and applicant there are many people involved in the processing of each application and communication problems develop quickly if great care is not taken from the start to prevent communication problems from developing it is important for both the town and the applicant to designate one person each to coordinate all communications this prevents repetition of questions prevents two people from giving different answers to the same question and should help to keep interpretation of opinions consistent a applicants authorized representative the application form shall designate one person to act as the authorized representative all communication to the applicant shall be made person and this person shall be present at all meetings with the board in the text of these regulations references to the applicant shall also imply the authorized representative b town 1 all communications to the town shall be directed to the planning board secretary unless otherwise directed by the chairman of the board this may be more likely during larger applications such as when an engineer reviewing the road design needs to talk to the design engineer to clarify issues 2 individual board members must exercise care when discussing application matters with the applicant abutters or other parties outside the forum of the boards meetings care must be taken to keep an open mind throughout the entire process not drawing conclusions until all relevant information has been received at the public hearing additionally board members should tell the board and the public the substance of any information they have received from the applicant abutters or other parties so that all can benefit from this knowledge and to provide an opportunity to challenge any information provided applicability there are three possible applications of this regulation to the development or change of a nonresidential or multifamily site the following criteria specify the level of review necessary a not applicable upon receipt of a written letter of acknowledgment from the officer this regulation is not applicable for the following 1 temporary events which require no permanent alterations to the site and which function safely within the approved configuration of the site as determined by the officer  2 special events approved by the town council  3 home occupations  4 within the m2 district change of use from one nonresidential use to another nonresidential use which involves no more than 500 square feet of gross floor space b minor review a minor review by the planning board shall be required for the following 1 change of use of a nonresidential site for which no change in floor area is proposed and which either maintains or decreases the intensity of use on the site with respect to parking demand and traffic generation or for a site with 2000 square feet or less of gross floor area  2 expansion of nonresidential floor space by 500 square feet or less with no change of use  3 within the m2 district any change of use of an existing nonresidential building which will be accompanied by a renovation of the facade of the building which in the opinion of the planning board will enhance its aesthetic contribution to the heritage and visual qualities of the village  4 site improvement alterations without new development redevelopment expansion or change of use  or 5 establishment of a bed and breakfast c major review a major review by the planning board shall be required for the following 1 establishment of nonresidential uses where no nonresidential use currently exists  2 establishment of multifamily use where no multifamily use currently exists  3 any other development redevelopment change of use or expansion of a multifamily or nonresidential site and not addressed in the  105a or b about town regulations a related town codes the town has other regulations which may affect an application the following is a list of related codes planning board bylaws conservation commission bylaws zoning board of adjustment bylaws zoning v subdivision regulations site plan review regulations excavation regulations b organization and cross references to fully understand this code it is important to understand how this regulation is organized and cross referenced 1 organization of this regulation a regulation is divided into six simply a grouping of related issues or requirements and readers should identify the article in which an answer is likely to be found the six sections are  100 general provisions  200 application procedures  300 design standards  400 plat standards  500 administration  600 application forms and checklists b subsections each divided into subsections each of which may be further divided as needed it is easiest to use the table of contents to locate the major subsections 2 cross referencing system within this regulation there are many references to other this code these cross references are provided to help the reader find needed information and to inform the reader of related provisions the reference for this written as follows  100 the symbol  means section in all cases the information following the  starts with the then the subsections in descending order the reference for this subsection is written as follows  106b2 the number to the left of the decimal point refers to the   the number following the decimal point is the subsection and so forth additional levels of hierarchy would be shown as follows  101b3ce the reader should note that only the first letter is capitalized and that the rounded parentheses are used before the square parentheses also the text of each level is indented farther than the previous level c shallshould the term shall requires a mandatory action in all cases while should implies that the action is appropriate in most cases the board is responsible for deciding on a casebycase basis how to apply the should provisions d state laws state laws are referenced frequently in this regulation in new hampshire state laws are known as revised statutes annotated which is abbreviated as rsa and are followed by the appropriate chapter and section references editors note the organization of the other regulations listed in subsection a of this section is no longer accurate as it was changed as part of the recodification process general guidance the following advice is offered to assist the applicant especially if the applicant is unfamiliar with land development processes a all applicants will need to hire professionals to prepare part or all of the application a nh licensed land surveyor andor licensed professional engineer are required in some cases other specialists will be needed possibly including an attorney a soil scientist or others while such assistance does cost money their skills and abilities are essential to ensure that the town and applicant have sound information on which to base their decisions b the board is concerned about processing all applications fairly and quickly to accomplish this the applicant shares certain responsibilities the applicant must be properly prepared this includes reading these regulations to understand the issues that must be addressed and includes dealing with all the significant issues up front incomplete submittals or failure to properly address issues will result in unnecessary delays in obtaining a final decision from the board c the application process is similar for all applications although the amount of work and time to obtain an approval vary widely 1 all applications follow this basic process  preparation the applicant prepares the application usually done by hired professionals this may involve some discussion with the board conceptual consultation or design review meetings  application acceptance upon submittal of the application materials to the town the application is placed on the next available planning board agenda for consideration by state law there is a minimum leadtime of 15 days  public hearing all applications will have a public hearing this is the official opportunity for the public to ask questions about the application to raise issues offer suggestions or indicate their support or opposition the hearing may be interspersed with periods of deliberation by the board and may be continued to future dates  decision in the end the board must decide whether to approve or deny the application in the majority of cases the board approves the application with conditions which means that there are additional administrative or technical requirements which must be satisfied to obtain the full approval 2 timing perhaps the most commonly asked question about an application to a planning board is how long will it take there is no standard answer at a minimum there must be a meeting with the board and this alone requires at least 15 days leadtime simple applications are often approved at a single meeting while more complex applications may take two or three months to complete however this general answer is all based on the assumptions that the applicant is properly prepared and that no unusual circumstances arise without the applicants consent however it is very unlikely that an application process can take longer than six months amd of 11181997 application process preliminary conceptual consultation this meeting shall be directed at a review of the basic concept of the proposal and suggestions that might be of assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirements during final consideration the board and applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form only and in general terms such as desirability of types of development and proposals under the master plan the presentation to the board of new surveys engineering plans or similar materials shall not be allowed under this process so the chairman must be careful to keep these discussions at a general level typically maps from the master plan tax maps county soil survey maps and the like are acceptable levels of generality upon which to base these discussions such consultation shall not bind either the applicant or the board and statements made by board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken such discussion may occur without the necessity of giving formal public notice but such discussions may occur only at formal meetings of the board preliminary conceptual consultation meetings are strictly optional to the applicant design review the board and applicant may engage in nonbinding discussions beyond conceptual and general discussions addressing more specific design planning and engineering details provided that the design review may proceed only after formal public notice is provided statements made by board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members of invalidating any action taken the applicant shall pay appropriate public notice fees as specified in  205b and shall provide all required materials and information required for public notice per  209 and  210 design review meetings are strictly optional to the applicant but such meetings can be helpful in identifying and resolving problems in an application prior to major design investments by the applicant minor review the application for a minor review shall be made to the

of newmarket that the appearance of the town be perceived as an attractive commercial environment which reflects and compliments its heritage the architecture of newmarket spans several periods of design in new england including some 18 th century 19 th century and early 20 th century structures it is important to continue to allow diversity of building designs and architectural styles which blend well with the buildings from these periods it is also important to avoid economic hardship and impose unreasonable standards on existing building owners who wish to make modifications to their structures this regulation applies only to structures located along route 108 a design criteria new building designs will be evaluated using the following factors design criteria are also provided
