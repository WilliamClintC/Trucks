future development in the area 7 what effect would the rezoning have on property values 8 would the rezoning cause a considerable increase in the volume of traffic can existing roads accommodate this

environment the r1a district provides an opportunity to satisfy ones housing preference without unduly contributing to uneconomical urban sprawl conditions 3 the r1a district will lessen urbanizing forces on the good agricultural land and reduce the possible mixture of farm and nonfarm dwellings which have several undesirable effects including assessment practices and weed problems related to uncultivated land 4 acreage zoning is necessary to prohibit erosion and sedimentation in certain areas of the township where topographical conditions are such that the removal of vegetative cover

predictable inundations at frequent intervals such regulations as herein established while permitting reasonable economic use of affected properties will protect the public health and reduce potential financial obligations on the township and its individuals by frequent and periodic floods by restricting the use of flood lands areas are reserved for the impoundment of water with a consequent stabilized stream flow which promotes and maintains the streams ecological environment 241 boundaries further defined the floodplain and floodway districts are hereby established overlay districts meaning that these districts are overlaid upon the districts and the land so enclosed may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying districts only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in this district the floodplain and floodway districts are hereby established as shown on the milan township zoning map which accompanies this resolution as used in this the terms floodplain and floodway refer in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of these terms these terms also refer to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries are established on the map identified in this which boundaries are intended to correspond to the actual physical location of floodways and floodplains these overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy rather than physical criteria the floodplain area is the same as delineated in the floodplain building regulations as provided by the erie regional planning commission in any area that is located outside a designated floodplain but where a stream is located no building or fill may be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the steam at the top of the bank or twenty feet on each side whichever is greater all land lying within the floodplain of the one hundred 100 year frequency flood of including but not limited to the huron river mud brook and poncas creek is within the

obstruction may be located within any floodway except as provided in with issuance of a floodplain permit from the erie regional planning commission 2 for purposes of this an artificial obstruction is any obstruction other than a natural obstruction that is capable of reducing the floodcarrying capacity of a stream or may accumulate debris and thereby reduce the floodcarrying capacity of a stream a natural obstruction includes any rock tree gravel or analogous natural matter that is an obstruction and has been located within the floodway by a nonhuman cause 243 permissible uses within floodways

adequate to secure the building is required 4 no new residential building may be constructed and no substantial improvements of a nonresidential building may take place within any floodplain unless the lowest floor including basement of the building or improvement is elevated or floodproofed to or above the base flood level where floodproofing is used in lieu of elevation a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that any new construction or substantial improvement has been designed to withstand the flood depths pressure velocities impact and uplift forces associated with the base flood at the location of the building and that the walls below the base flood level are substantially impermeable to the passage of water 5 for purposes of this substantial improvement means for a building constructed prior to the effective date of this any repair reconstruction or improvement of a building the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either a before the improvement or repair is started or b if the structure has been damaged and is being restored before the damage occurred substantial improvement occurs when the first alteration on any wall ceiling floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building the term does not however include with a any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health sanitary or safety code specifications that are solely necessary to insure safe living conditions or b any alteration of a building listed on the national register of historic places or a state inventory of historic places 6 no zoning special use or conditional use permit may be issued

inches the support must contain steel reinforcement 8 dumping or backfilling with any material or excavation in any manner is prohibited unless a through compensating excavation and shaping of the floodplain the flow and impounding capacity of the floodplain will be maintained or improved and will not cause an increase in the flood hazard or damage from floods and will not allow water to collect in pools that will stagnate b no significantly measurable reduction in the flow or impoundment capacity of the floodplain thereby results c where there is dumping backfilling or excavation in any manner adequate site plans and engineering drawings shall be submitted to effectively show the final result of such action 245 site and landscaping plan review for all development in the floodplain district a site plan shall be submitted to the township zoning inspector for hisher review and recommendations the zoning inspector in the review of the site plan shall have regard to the

conditions for various uses classifications of uses or areas wherein problems may occur in order to alleviate or preclude such problems and to promote the harmonious exercise of property rights without conflict these supplementary district regulations are however nonetheless intended to recognize as valid those uses of land currently in existence that were lawful when such uses commenced 251
