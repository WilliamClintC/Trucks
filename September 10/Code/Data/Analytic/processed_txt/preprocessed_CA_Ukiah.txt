california has recognized by the adoption of special legislation regulating tenancies of mobilehome owners in mobilehome parks that there is a significant distinction between homeowners in mobilehome parks and other dwelling units and the state likewise has recognized that homeowners in mobilehome parks unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a residence the space for which is rented or leased as distinguished from owned the physical removal and relocation of a mobilehome from a rented or leased space within a mobilehome park can be accomplished only at substantial cost and inconvenience with a limited concurrent ability to find another location and in many instances the removal requires a separation of the mobilehome unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobilehome because of the limited availability of vacant spaces in mobilehome parks the age and condition of some mobilehomes and the cost of moving mobilehomes it is extremely difficult if not impossible to move a mobilehome from one park to another within the city bthere is presently within the city and the surrounding areas a shortage of sites for the placement of mobilehomes caccording to the ukiah general plan housing element mobilehomes presently constitute an important source of housing for persons of extremely low very low low and moderate income levels who as a group are unable to afford unreasonably large rent increases da large number of persons living in mobilehomes are elderly some of whom live on small fixed incomes these persons may expend a substantial portion of their income on rent and may not be able to afford other housing within the city erents for sites within mobilehome parks in the city have prior to the adoption of this chapter increased substantially with recent increases in one park exceeding by a substantial amount the annual increase in the cost of living fspace rent increases at the time of sale or other transfer of a mobilehome within a park have been shown to be substantially over the pretransfer rent such large rent increases at the time of sale of a mobilehome may unfairly depress the sales price of the mobilehome and work an economic hardship on the mobilehome owner the annual rent increases and vacancy control provisions of this chapter prevent this economic hardship while protecting the property rights of owners gbecause of the space shortage and potential for rapidly rising rents regulation is necessary to assure that economic hardship to a substantial number of mobilehome owners in the city many of whom are senior citizens on low fixed incomes does not occur hit is the purpose of this chapter to establish a speedy and efficient method of reviewing certain requested mobilehome space rent increases in mobilehome parks to protect mobilehome owners from arbitrary capricious or unreasonable site rent adjustments while ensuring owners andor operators and investors a fair and reasonable return on their investment in their mobilehome park adopted 2010 2701

rebut the presumption of fair and reasonable return based upon the base year net operating income to make such a determination and in order to adjust to the base year net operating income the

income yielded more or less than a fair net operating income the arbitrator shall consider the following factors 1substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by uninsured disaster or vandalism  2maintenance and repairs were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration of housing services  3other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding prudent business

thin staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to intolerable added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution a significant number of high school students are eighteen 18 years of age or older it would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use making it

yard a building that occupies one side of the lot with the setback to the other side the visual opening of the side yard on the street frontage causes this building type to appear freestanding a shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition if the adjacent building is similar with a blank party wall the yard can be quite private this type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze examples of uses often associated with this building type include duplex multifamily livework and mixeduse image gu uc b rear yard a building that occupies the full frontage leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard this is a very urban type as the continuous facade steadily defines the public thoroughfare the rear elevations may be articulated for functional

identifying the tpz shall remain in place for the duration of grading and construction the sign shall read warning tree protection zone this fencing shall not be removed without approval of the

tools and small handheld power tools and shall not be of a depth that could cause root damage 8when the existing grade around a protected tree is to be raised the project arborist shall provide written directions on which methods may be used to drain liquids away from the trunk 9when the existing grade around a protected tree is to be lowered the project arborist shall provide written directions on which methods may be used such as terracing retaining wall to allow the drip line to be left at the original grade 10no equipment solvents paint asphalt or debris of any kind shall be placed stored or allowed within the protective barrier ereplacement trees 1development projects healthy trees as defined by subsection c3 of this section approved for removal as part of a development

trees for primary streets table 22 alternate street trees for primary streets and table 23 required street trees for nonprimary streets are based on the trees ability to grow well in ukiahs climate withstand the street tree setting and the following design principles astreet trees by virtue of a narrow tree trunk provide transparency at the pedestrians eye level permitting a visual grasp of extensive areas of a city bthe type spacing structure and pattern of street trees create a discrete rhythm that results from the arrangement of trees expressing the particular site cstreet trees create a smaller scale of space with their canopies that is sympathetic to the movement and perception of pedestrians dthe diversity of individual trees is subordinate to the repetitive pattern of the whole which unifies the individual parts into a single whole estreet trees when formed from a single species can create a homogeneity of texture pattern light and shade resulting in a collective impact that is more important than the individual trees fthe ground surface is visually unobstructed to permit a clear visual expression of trees rising out of the ground gstreet trees provide a buffer between the pedestrian and vehicle travelparking lanes creating an enhanced sense of safety exh a  adopted 2012 92296 use of alternate tree species tables 22 and 25 provide alternative tree
