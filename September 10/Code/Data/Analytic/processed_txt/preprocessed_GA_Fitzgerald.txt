and council take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country moreover it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow andor encourage nudity to that end this section is hereby adopted b enactment the following types of entertainment attire and conduct are prohibited upon any

the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of fitzgerald of ben hill county georgia does ordain as set out in the following sections  81009 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of city of fitzgerald georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  81009 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  81009 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  and 7 to insure that potential homebuyers are notified

prevent the discharge of pollutants which pass works inadequately treated t users in industrial categories subject to effluent guidelines issued under section 304b of the act which are discharging incompatible pollutants to publicly owned treatment works are required to adopt best practicable control technology currently available as defined by the administrator pursuant to section 304b of the act u where the treatment works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants suspended solids ph and fecal coliform bacteria it is not appropriate to require the industrial user to achieve best practical control technology currently available since this would lead to an uneconomical duplication of treatment facilities while the term substantial removal is not subject to precise definition it generally contemplates removals in the order of eighty 80 percent or greater minor incidental removals in the order of ten 10 to thirty 30 percent are not considered substantial
