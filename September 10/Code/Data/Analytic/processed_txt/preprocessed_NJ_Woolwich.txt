regulate encroachment in floodplains and surface water areas in the township demolition permit shall be obtained and the facility shall be removed upon removal the site shall be cleaned restored and revegetated to blend with the existing surrounding vegetation at the time of abandonment a purpose and policy it is hereby found that various streams and waterways in the township of woolwich related to the delaware river tributaries are subject to recurring flooding that such flooding damages and endangers life and public and private property and facilities that this condition is aggravated by

is further acknowledged that surface water areas including streams ponds lakes and wetlands associated recreation or immediately adjacent land areas constitute sources of groundwater recharge stormwater storage fish and wildlife habitat and aesthetic value to the community as a whole it is therefore determined that the special and paramount public interest in the floodplains and surface water areas justifies the regulation of property located therein as provided in this chapter which is in the exercise of the police power of the municipality for the protection of the persons and

maintain the rural character while preserving open space and natural resources in the r3 district in conformance with the mlul the purposes of options 1 2 and 3 are as follows amended 5212018 by  a to conserve farmland and open space including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands steep slopes streams floodplains and wetlands by setting them aside from development  b to provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the design of services and infrastructure including the opportunity to reduce length of roads utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential development  c to reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation and the minimization of development on steep slopes  d to provide for a diversity of lot sizes and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups and residential preferences so that the communitys population diversity will be maintained  e to implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the townships open space plan including provisions for reasonable incentives to create a greenway system for the benefit of present and future residents   20341 woolwich code  20342  f to implement adopted land use transportation and community polices as identified

of dwelling types as well as nonresidential uses which are defined within the weatherby commercial zoning overlay this overlay is intended to apply to the area designated as town center within the weatherby general development plan this area is expected to provide opportunities for communitylevel rather than regional commercial uses serving the needs of weatherby and nearby neighborhoods it is also intended to apply to certain outparcels that are adjacent to but not part of the weatherby planned unit development it is recognized that the exact location of the commercial overlay may be adjusted with the approval of the planning board and the applicability of the overlay to outparcels  20344 woolwich code  20345  is intended to be flexible as the boundaries of the commercial overlay

intended to permit the development of a balanced community comprised of residential uses and under certain circumstances nonresidential uses with a range of densities recreational facilities and related uses while preserving a significant amount of public and common open space it is intended that planned developments will encourage the consolidation of residential and nonresidential development in sectors of the township where existing or anticipated roads and utility services can best accommodate development and will offer increased design flexibility in order that entire parcels of land may be developed in a comprehensive manner and sequence throughout the life of the development this district is intended to achieve the following public objectives a to offer a variety of housing types b to preserve and enhance open space and natural resources of all types for both passive and active recreation purposes c to permit a greater mixture of compatible residential and nonresidential land uses in areas designated by the weatherby general development plan approval d to promote creativity and innovation in the design process e to create opportunities for efficient

described above shall apply to all nonresidential structures regardless of zone and will be reviewed and approved by the woolwich township planning board in the best interest of the residents of woolwich township c architectural styles existing primary architectural styles within the township generally include vernacular colonial revival georgian revival and queen anne victorian the design of new buildings should be representative of the current era yet incorporated with design elements of existing primary architectural styles of the township 1 vernacular floor plans are square t or l in shape exterior features include raised front porches wood siding or masonry walls various pitched gable roofs and symmetrical fenestration on the front facade 2 colonial revival wood frame rectangular structures having wood or brick exteriors most buildings have symmetrical floor plans with flanking wings roof forms such as hipped doublepitched and mansard other features include doublehung multipaned windows pediment dormers raised porticos and fan lighting entries 3 georgian revival the overall features may be described as symmetrical composition enriched with classical detail common features include wood siding on wood frame construction or red brick siding roofs can be hipped or gambrel shaped and eaves are generally detailed as a classical cornice the central portion of the facade may project and have a pediment with or without pilasters 4 queen anne victorian queen anne styles have asymmetrical shapes characterized by bays and prominent varied rooflines common characteristics are rich yet simple ornament a variety of materials including wood terra cotta stone and pressed metal expansive porches bays and irregular roof lines with many dormers and chimneys d building and structure design critical attention shall be given to building materials use of color and texture building or structure massing and height as they relate to site conditions and harmonious integration with similar existing elements in neighboring buildings or structures buildings or structures shall be designed to be part of individual communities or streetscapes that are appropriate to woolwich township prototype or formula buildings and color schemes are undesirable unless they conform to the standards of this section 1 facades a building facades shall emphasize the architectural philosophy of relief and rhythm rhythm should be used in the design to provide interest and variety and avoid monotony details that create shade and cast shadows can be used to provide visual  20349 youth sports  20349  relief to the building buildings shall be broken into a series of volumes that lessen the overall mass b building facades shall be segmented with architectural details such as recesses projections overhangs canopies or porticos arcades raised parapets peaked roof forms integral planters and other similar features building facades greater than 60 feet in length including separate buildings that are attached shall incorporate a minimum of three architecture elements as described above recesses or projections shall extend a minimum of three feet from the primary building wall plane c there shall be no uninterrupted walls greater than 40 feet in length the length of the building shall visually appear to be proportional to the height using a rate of 25 times the height of the building equal to the length architectural details may be utilized to create the appearance of segmented buildings where several smaller freestanding buildings are not feasible 2

development is a complex of buildings such as a shopping center or an office or industrial park with its own design guidelines the complex should have a strong sense of place and unity of design the complex should not be out of keeping with the surrounding buildings but may clearly establish its own identity the following shall be used in evaluating the complex the complex shall have a sense of place this should be accomplished by several elements a commonality of materials and style b a uniform sign package that limits style of letters colors and has rules for size location and height based on building importance in the complex c an element or elements that provide a strong identifying image the strength of the image should be related and proportional to the scale of the development a small project should have an image that is more closely related to neighbors while a large regional facility should have greater differentiation from its neighbors features such as a clock tower fountain sculpture or corner building that has a strong image are ways in which a strong identity may be created 2 orientation and siting in the case of freestanding buildings or structures and depending on individual site characteristics consideration shall be given to site design that provides a desirable visual composition avoids blocking natural vistas and provides desirable and pleasing

jersey the zoning regulations and design standards address seven development sectors within the woolwich regional center and the auburn road village sectors have been identified and are designed to promote stability and sustainability to the concept of the community of the 21st century as they are designed to accommodate the growth of both regional and local services some pedestrianoriented some

address location mixture and intensities of permitted uses as well as site planning and architectural controls designed to promote vibrant urban form consistent with the visioning process undertaken by woolwich township officials civic leaders and citizens c this is not a document about architectural style by style we mean such descriptive terms as colonial victorian modern postmodern etc while each of us may have a collective memory of a place or places where such styles have elicited positive experiences of community the history of human settlement instructs us that basic design considerations independent of architectural style are determinants of successful human scale community building good design promotes  203117 woolwich code  203117  healthy community of place the tenets of good design expressed in this document are based on seven principles 1 scale the visual arrangement and massing of buildings voids and landscape elements that promote walkability and other alternative forms of transportation a sense of place and a human scale rather than autooriented suburban sprawl 2 rhythm a pattern of facade and streetscape elements that discourages monotony and creates an inviting pedestrian environment and visual compatibility with buildings and places 3 edges physical elements that define a place and provide transition to adjacent areas 4 colors and materials the visible components of buildings and streetscapes including siding trim doors windows gutters downspouts roofing and all other architectural and site elements they must be in context with their environment and must be sustainable low maintenance durable and tactile 5 density the proximity at which a community lives works and plays together 6 choice the provision of housing employment retail recreation and other services for people of all ages and lifestyles 7 diversity a variation of scale rhythm materials density and choice that provides an array of options for all people d the local visioning process has identified a series of goal statements as outlined below which are to be considered in the review of all development applications involving lands located within the mapped woolwich regional center and the auburn road village requests for variances waivers andor deviations from the ordinance provisions of this code shall be evaluated in the context of the impact the same may have on the following goal statements 1 promote traditional neighborhood developments where the physical visual and spatial characteristics are established and reinforced consistent use of compatible urban design and architectural design elements such elements shall relate characteristics of an individual structure or development to other existing or planned structures or developments in a harmonious manner resulting in an overall development pattern and streetscape 2 encourage innovative mixeduse and multipleuse plans so that the housing demand of varying age groups families and income levels may be met by greater variety of type design and layout of dwellings and by the construction and more efficient use of open space to that end the goal is to create smaller lots than currently  203117 youth sports  203117   203118 use of exist in woolwich township to accommodate a mixture of singlefamily detached units twins townhouses condominium flats and apartment flats above commercial and office uses which are to be integrated into the plan 3 promote the creation of neighborhoods and districts that are distinct and identifiable in landscape architecture and public space elements 4 encourage the development of sustainable community identified by economic and fiscal balance social integration and maximization of water and energy conservation use of passive and active technologies 5 encourage land development practices that will promote the public health safety and welfare by creating neotraditional land use alternatives to conventional usesegregated suburban sprawl such as largerlot subdivisions and strip commercial developments 6 discourage uses and design patterns that tend to contribute to traffic congestion dependence on private automobiles 7 establish a comprehensive street and path network based on the principles of the grid to accommodate an integrated multimodal transportation system with the intent of providing a safe pedestrian environment and pedestrian paths 8 alleviate undue traffic congestion by reducing excessive sprawl of development and the segregation of land uses which result in the inefficient use of land and which necessitate the use of private vehicles 9 encourage creative green technologies integrated into public spaces and private development parcels to achieve flood control stormwater recharge and water filtration in an effort to preserve an indispensable natural resource 10 allow for the directing of additional development of development rights tdrs in an effort to preserve the remaining rural

interconnection of existing and proposed uses so as to create integrated neighborhoods and a greater sense of community by using design techniques that provide for modified grid patterns accentuated with special more grand avenues 3 provide a layout of streets and open space edges which encourage pedestrian interconnections to residential civic and commercial uses within a onehalfmile walking distance 4 provide a clearly articulated and rationally designed open space system which consists of both integrated and peripheral active and passive parks 5 extend greater opportunities for housing commercial and recreational facilities to all residents of the township 6 encourage a more efficient use of land and public services by directing development in a pattern that resembles a traditional mixeduse development with varied housing types 7 provide an approval which will require the development to relate the type design and layout of residential development on any site  203118 youth sports  203119   203120 general provisions to the surrounding environs and context and to the townships goal of encouraging mixeduse neotraditional development in a manner sensitive to the preservation or enhancement of property within existing residential areas 8 establish policies and procedures intended to promote flexibility for the marketability of dwelling unit types while requiring the maintenance of the underlying integrity of the plan in an efficient and expedient forum 9 discourage generic modern suburban development that bears no relation to the historic development pattern of the township and gloucester county while promoting the creation of new neighborhoods and developments that exhibit the design features of neotraditional neighborhoods and small towns in the county 10 promote the creation of places which are oriented to the pedestrian promote citizen security and social interaction 11 establish community plazas and squares which act as focal points of activity and interaction for both commercial and residential neighborhoods 12 promote developments with visual and spatial characteristics as expressed in the components of the regulating plan and site plan and design standards 13 incorporate a land use component specifically addressed to the needs of senior citizens 14 develop a plan that addresses the fiscal imbalance of current zoning and provides a phasing of development in a fiscally responsible manner 15 accommodate both the need and desire for the automobile in community planning a this supersedes any provisions of the woolwich township site

construction of sustainable or green buildings the guidelines that follow are intended to result in environmentally friendly and economically vibrant projects be counted towards this shared parking arrangement must be demonstrated to be available during the hours of operation of the affected uses and access to those spaces must be provided for vehicles and pedestrians in a safe and efficient manner including shared driveways and interconnected walkways where possible b the township planner may conduct site visits to confirm that the amount of parking provided is being utilized by the development and in fact that the parking remains sufficient to meet the needs of the development if at any time it is determined that this is no longer the case the construction of additional banked or reserved parking spaces may be required by the township planner to meet the demand h the piling of snow is discouraged in required parking spaces or where it will damage landscaping or appear unsightly in the public view a green building certification according to the us green building council usgbc leadership in energy and environmental design leed evaluates environmental performance from a whole building perspective over a buildings lifecycle providing a definitive standard for what constitutes a green building it is based on accepted energy and environmental principles and strikes a balance between known established practices and emerging concepts leed is a performanceoriented system in which scoring points are earned for satisfying performance criteria in the categories of sustainable site development for new construction reducing the urban heat island energy efficiency water savings materials selection and indoor environmental quality different levels of green building certification are awarded by the usgbc based on the total points earned as a means of evaluating and measuring achievements in sustainable design this encourages design construction and operation of developments that meet the criteria for a leedcertified rating b reducing the urban heat island the ambient air in urban environments is usually significantly warmer sometimes more than 10 f warmer than the air in less developed areas an effect known as the urban heat island dark nonreflective surfaces absorb heat from the sun and then radiate it back to the surrounding area such hotter temperatures lead to an increased need for air conditioning which costs money and consumes significant amounts of energy current statistics show that air conditioning consumes 16 of all electricity used in the united  203157 youth sports  203158  states the following guidelines help to mitigate the formation of an urban heat island 1 provide shade within five years for 30% of the sites nonroof impervious surfaces 2 use lightcoloredhighalbedo materials reflectance of a least 03 for at least 30% of the sites nonroof impervious surfaces 3 use highly reflective and highemissive roofing material at least 09 when tested in accordance with astm 408 for at least 75% of the roof surface in addition to the operational benefits to the building this application helps to extend the life span of a roof 4 use a green vegetative roof for at least 50% of the roof area in addition to its ability to reduce stormwater flows and provide insulation this application helps to extend the life span of the roof c energy efficiency 1 buildings should be designed to exceed by 20% the state energy code or the most recent edition of ashraeiesna standard 901 without amendments whichever is more stringent 2 building owners are encouraged to provide a portion of the total energy used by a building with onsite renewable sources such as photovoltaic systems d water savings the following guidelines help decrease the amount of municipal water needed for buildings 1 decrease the quantity of potable water used for landscape irrigation by 50% 2 install ultralowflow fixtures in bathrooms and consider reusing roof runoff volumes for flushing toilets in order to reduce the amount of potable water required e materials selection and indoor environmental quality the following materials guidelines ensure quality environments that help decrease the environmental impact of the materials needed for buildings 1 divert as much construction waste away from disposal in landfills as possible by recycling construction materials including metal wood concrete brick drywall and cardboard 2 incorporate building materials that contain a high percentage of recycled content 3 incorporate building

site identity as well as focal points for customer use the elements also act to reduce the harshness of large parking lots often associated with big box retail b scale of otherwise large buildings can be broken down use of offsets in facades and rooflines materials use and arcades and other sheltered walkways c signage should be integrated into the facade design 2 photo 2 a the playful use of signage can serve to break down the scale of otherwise large buildings when integrated into the entire architectural design of the building and used in conjunction with vertical and horizontal building offsets material changes and orientation of horizontal and vertical elements b overscaled objects can serve as both whimsical sculpture and safety bollards to protect pedestrians the objects further provide a playful dialogue on scale within the public and semipublic spaces c public entry points should be distinguished in the architecture  203184 youth sports  203184  d it is important to
