overall number of newly established locations for wireless communications equipment and wireless communications support structures within the city of livonia and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communications purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in paragraph a of this section above in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communications equipment and support structures reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the city of livonia that all users should collocate on wireless communications support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in paragraph a of this section if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the city of livonia the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the city of livonia 2 feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communications provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation b the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a support structure is able to provide structural support c the collocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city of livonia taking into consideration the several standards contained in paragraph d of this section above 3 requirements for collocation a a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communications support structure shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communications support structures shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation for a minimum of three 3 total users the planning official and building official may reduce the number of required users if they are convinced that a total of three 3 users will be unfeasible c the policy of the city of livonia is for collocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communications support structure within the city of livonia shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such structure shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new wireless communications support structure the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the city of livonia and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communications support structure within the city of livonia for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communications services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communications services 4 incentive review of
