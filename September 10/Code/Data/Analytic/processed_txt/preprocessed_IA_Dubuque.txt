council take formal action b classification of motions 1 main motions a main motion is one which independently presents an idea for consideration only one main motion can be considered at a given time and such a motion when introduced excludes all other main motions until it has been voted upon or disposed of otherwise 2 subsidiary motions a subsidiary motion is one growing out of and applied to another motion already under consideration their existence as motions depend entirely upon the principal motion to which they are subordinate such motions must be voted upon before voting upon the motion to which they apply 3 privileged motions a privileged motion is one which is so vital in character that it takes precedence over all other motions such motions have no connection with the motion under consideration a privileged motion sets aside temporarily any business under consideration 4 incidental motions an incidental motion is one growing out of another motion already under consideration such a motion must be disposed of before the main motion or other business under consideration c progress of motions 1 a council member addresses the presiding officer the presiding officer should be addressed by title 2 the council member is recognized by the presiding officer the presiding officer recognizes the council member by name or by a nod having received formal recognition from the presiding officer the council member is said to have the floor and is the only member entitled to present or discuss a motion 3 the council member proposes a motion a motion is always introduced in the form i move that followed by a statement of the proposal aside from very brief explanatory remarks it is not permissible to discuss the merits of a motion prior to or immediately following the formal proposal of the motion all discussion must wait until the presiding officer has stated the motion and has asked for discussion 4 another council member seconds the motion another council member without addressing the presiding officer may say i second the motion seconding the motion is merely an indication that the council member seconding it wishes the matter to come to the city council for consideration if no one seconds the motion the presiding officer may ask is there a second to the motion if there is none the presiding officer may declare the motion is lost for want of a second 5 the presiding officer states the motion to the city council when a motion has been properly proposed and seconded the presiding officer repeats the motion to the city council after the motion has been formally stated to the city council the motion may be spoken of as a question a proposition or a measure 6 the city council discusses or debates the motion after the motion has been formally stated by the presiding officer any council member has a right to discuss the issue council members must obtain the floor in the same manner as when presenting a motion normally the first person who asks recognition is entitled to speak all discussion must be confined to the question under consideration the presiding officer should always show preference to the proposer of the motion a council member who has not spoken before has claim over a council member who has already discussed the question or who has proposed another motion if the presiding officer knows the opinions of the various council members regarding the measure the presiding officer should alternate between those favoring the measures and those in opposition to the measure the presiding officer should recognize a council member who seldom speaks in preference of a council member who frequently speaks 7 the presiding officer takes the vote on the motion when all council members who desire to discuss the question have done so the presiding officer puts the motion to a vote before taking the vote the presiding officer may inquire is there any further discussion or are you ready for the question if no council member responds the presiding officer presumes discussion is closed the presiding officer will proceed to instruct the city clerk to take a roll call vote 8 the presiding officer announces the result of the vote the presiding officer formally announces the result of the vote saying the motion is carried or the motion is lost as soon as the vote has been announced another motion is in order 2007  16a8 amendments to motions any amendment to a motion changes a motion by adding to it taking from it or by altering it in some other way the purpose of the motion to amend is to modify a motion that has already been presented in such a manner that it will be more satisfactory to the council members an amendment to a motion may be hostile but it must be germane by germane it is meant having direct bearing upon the subject matter of the motion  that is relevant or relating to it  sterling codifiers inc  25716 a methods of amending motions 1 by addition or insertion to add something to the motion which it did not contain 2 by eliminating or by striking out to subtract or eliminate something from a motion that was originally a part of the motion 3 by substitution this method is a combination of the first two 2 methods since in amending by substitution something is stricken out and something inserted in its place the substitution may consist of a word a phrase a clause or an entirely new motion b progress of amendments 1 types of amendments a amendments of the first rank this is an amendment to the motion b amendments of the second rank this is an amendment to the amendment this type of amendment must modify and relate directly to the amendment and not to the main motion otherwise it is out of order it is not in order to propose more than one amendment of each rank at one time if a council member wishes to amend two 2 separate and related parts of a motion this must be done by two 2 amendments of the second rank and one must be voted upon before the other is proposed it is permissible to have a motion one amendment to the motion amendment of the first rank and one amendment to the amendment amendment of the second rank before the city council at once until the amendment of the second rank has been voted upon no other amendment of the second rank is in order until the amendment of the first rank is voted upon no other amendment of the first rank can be proposed 2 order of voting a amendments are voted upon in inverse order  that is the amendment of the second rank is disposed of first b discussion is held and the vote taken upon the amendment to the amendment c discussion is held and the vote taken upon the amendment to the motion d when the vote on the amendments have been taken discussion upon the original or the main motion as amended is held and when completed a vote is taken upon the original or main motion as amended 2007  16a9chart of preference of motions chart of preference of

finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential role as part of the citys basic infrastructure cable television systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights of way in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide essential services to the public subject to special public interest obligations such as utility companies the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and placing the holder in a position of public trust the city finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest b further it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the citys residents but can provide a variety of broadband interactive communications services to institutions and individuals many of these services involve city agencies and other public institutions  112a3 goals in light of the provisions of section 112a2 of this article the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this article a cable should be available to as many city residents and businesses as possible b a cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable related needs of the city c a cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent commercially practicable into existing system facilities d a cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and service to the public  sterling codifiers inc  278716 e a cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of scarce and valuable local public rights of way  112a4 intent the city intends that all provisions set forth in this article be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this article be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof  112a5 delegation of

regulated in article 545 of the national electrical code manufactured buildings must comply with the provisions of article 545 a wellestablished means of codifying fire protection and fire safety requirements is to classify buildings by types of construction based on materials used for the structural elements and the degree of fire resistance afforded by each element the five fundamental construction types used by the model building codes are type i fire resistive type ii noncombustible type iii combination of combustible and noncombustible type iv heavy timber and type v wood frame types i and ii basically require all structural elements to be noncombustible whereas types iii iv and v allow some or all of the structural elements to be combustible wood the selection of building construction types is regulated by the local building code based on the occupancy height and area of the building when a building of a selected height in feet or stories above grade and area is permitted to be built of combustible construction ie types iii iv or v the installation of nonmetallicsheathed cable is permitted the common areas corridors and incidental and subordinate uses laundry rooms lounge rooms etc that serve a multifamily dwelling occupancy are also considered part of the multifamily occupancy thereby allowing the use of nonmetallicsheathed cable in those areas if a building is to be of noncombustible construction ie type i or ii by the owners choice even though the building code would permit combustible construction the building is allowed to be wired with nonmetallicsheathed cable in such an instance nonmetallicsheathed cable may be installed in the noncombustible building because the code would have permitted the building to be of combustible construction 5 which was previously in 33410a1 exception permits type nm nonmetallicsheathed cables to be installed in type i and type ii construction if the cables are within permitted raceways a

are unreasonable which is more properly the subject of a text amendment proposal in all cases the burden shall be upon the persons seeking reclassification to demonstrate that the requested
