2 7617 overlay development district odd a purpose intent and qualifications 1 general purpose because traditional zoning separates uses into different districts using restrictive placement controls it does not allow for creative development incorporating a variety of uses the purpose of the overlay development district odd is to encourage development of those parcels of land which because of their size  their location being uniquely situated with regard to higher density adjoining uses  or their unique environmental features a more flexible development scheme could foster creative development design or preserve desirable natural features significant historical landmarks and architectural features located within the odd therefore the odd modifies the traditional form of zoning and permits variety in design site configuration setbacks layout use and encourages efficiency in use of land and natural resources while ensuring compatibility with surrounding land uses in return for greater flexibility in site design requirements odds are expected to deliver exceptional quality community designs that provide aboveaverage pedestrian amenities incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings focus on pedestrian space and circulation  incorporate public art  assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood character  incorporate green infrastructure stormwater management measures and the restoration of natural functions tree planting or soil amendment  and provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of roads utilities and other infrastructure finally odds authorized under this chapter see attached map shall provide a better and more desirable living and physical environment than what would be possible under the zoning regulations that apply to the development or traditional zoning district while implementing the policies and objectives of the comprehensive master plan as amended 2 general intent the adoption of an odd is intended to encourage creativity unified development of property utilizing mixed residential commercial and nonresidential uses that provide adequate housing and employment opportunities it is the intent of this article to allow rezoning of qualifying properties to odd the specific objectives of the odd are to a encourage innovation in land uses and variety of design layout and type of structures constructed b promote low impact development lid and green infrastructure stormwater management techniques as defined in this chapter c achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land natural resources energy and the provision of public services and utilities d permit flexibility in the placement setbacks lot area and building type regulations and combination of uses while assuring the application of sound site planning standards e encourage the provision of pedestrian amenities and more extensive landscaping particularly landscaping that restores natural functions soil quality tree canopy restoration and use of native plantings where appropriate f provide opportunities for improvements to public streets or facilities pathways and infrastructure g promote the development of walkable mixeduse developments that will result in more sustainable and healthy community h achieve consistent and coordinated site design and higher quality architectural design and materials i encourage the use reuse redevelopment and improvement of existing sites j encourage the use and improvement of land where site conditions make development under conventional zoning difficult and less desirable k incorporate public art 3 intent of requiring development agreement it is recognized that because of the complexity and uniqueness of each parcel or tract of land proposed for odd rezoning it is beneficial to the city and the development process if a development agreement which includes all conceptual plans architectural elevations development standards and specified conditions tailored

by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this section to 1 facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities 2 establish predetermined districts of the number shape and in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions 3 recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the community consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities 4 ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings 5 limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs 6 promote the public health safety and welfare 7 provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities including a requirement to remove unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner 8 minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities including a requirement to remove unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner 9 minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on neighborhoods community landmarks historic sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsofway this contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section 10 the city council finds that the presence of numerous tower structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare b definitions the following definitions shall apply in the

wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the city and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in paragraph a of this section above each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonable anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the city that all users should collocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in paragraph a of this section if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the city the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the city 2 feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation b the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the collocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city taking into consideration the several standards contained in parts d and f of this section above 3 requirements for collocation a a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation c the policy of the city is for collocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to  b3 alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect h removal 1 a condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners upon the occurrence of one 1 or more of the following events a when the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty 180 days or more for purposes of this section the removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility or the cessation of operations transmission andor reception of radio signals shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse b six 6 months after new technology is available at reasonable cost as determined by the municipal legislative body which permits the operation of the communication system without the requirement of the support structure 2 the situations in which removal of a facility is required as set forth in paragraph 1 above may be applied and limited to portions of a facility 3 upon the occurrence of one 1 or more of the events requiring removal specified in paragraph 1 above the property owner or persons who had used the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or

reserved d  reserved for rainwater harvesting systems a identify opportunities where water can be reused for irrigation or used for indoor greywater reuse from this calculate the water need for the intended uses for example if a two thousand 2000 square feet landscaped area requires irrigation for four 4 months in the summer at a rate of one 1 inch per week  the designer must determine how much water will be needed to achieve this goal and how often the storage unit will be refilled via precipitation the usage requirements and the expected rainfall volume and frequency must be determined b rain barrels and cisterns should be positioned to receive rooftop runoff c provide for the use or release of stored water between storm events in order for the necessary stormwater storage volume to be available d if cisterns are used to supplement greywater needs a parallel conveyance system must be installed to separate reused stormwater or greywater from other potable water piping systems do not connect to domestic or commercial potable water systems e household water demands must be considered when sizing a system to supplement residential greywater f pipes or storage units must be clearly marked caution reclaimed water do not drink g screens must be used to filter debris from storage units h protect storage elements from direct sunlight by positioning and landscaping limit light into devices to minimize algae growth i the proximity to building foundations must be considered from overflow conditions overflow discharge must be a minimum of ten 10 feet from building foundation j climate is an important consideration capturereuse systems must be disconnected and emptied during winter to prevent freezing k cisterns must be watertight joints sealed with nontoxic waterproof material with a smooth interior surface and capable of receiving water from rainwater harvesting system l covers and lids must have a tight fit to keep out surface water animals dust and light m positive outlet for overflow must be provided a few inches from the top of the cistern n observation risers must be at least six 6 inches above grade for buried cisterns o reuse may require pressurization to add pressure a pump pressure tank and fine mesh filter can be used which adds to the cost of the system but creates a more usable system p rain barrels require a release mechanism in order to drain empty between storm events connect a soaker hose to slowly release stored water to a landscaped area  2 7617 article 5  singlefamily residence districts r a r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r e intent these residential districts are intended to provide areas in the city for singlefamily dwellings as permitted uses and residentially related uses subject to special approval the districts are designed

special attention will be given to the creation of private garden areas public sitting areas tot lots and park areas prime locations for the use of this option will be those areas where natural features would be destroyed due to the mass grading resulting from the conventional subdividing of property to accomplish this modifications to the singlefamily residential standards as outlined in article 22 schedule of regulations shall be permitted 1 the city council may after recommendation from the planning commission approve the clustering andor attaching of singlefamily dwelling units on

residential developed and suburban and is home to more than one thousand one hundred 1100 acres of wetlands twentynine 29 acres of ponds seven 7 acres of lakes and sixteen thousand eight hundred eighteen 16818 acres of watershed areas between the rouge river watershed and clinton river watershed  and contains unique natural features such as over two thousand three hundred eightyfive 2385 acres of protected woodland wildlife habitats walking trails paths and other environmentally sensitive areas 2 the city has a longstanding tradition of protecting environmentally sensitive areas as exemplified by its wetland and watercourse protective ordinance enacted on  and its woodland and tree preservation ordinance enacted on  and the establishment and development of the carpenter lake nature preserve and the valley woods wetland restoration project additionally the city employs a welltrained staff charged with protecting and enhancing the natural environment by implementing active programs in woodland and wetland protection environmental education and planning soil erosion and sediment control solid waste management nuisance and blight abatement and eradication 3 preservation of environmentally sensitive areas shall be and is necessary to maintain hydrologic economic recreational and aesthetic assets for existing and future residents of the city 4 the development of innovative methods of gas and oil exploration and extraction has resulted in oil and gas development activities appearing in areas that traditionally have not been areas subject to oil and gas activities such as densely populated largely residential suburban cities in michigan 5 residents in cities across the nation and in michigan have experienced the adverse secondary impacts of oil and gas activities where oil and gas development activities have occurred near or adjacent to residential uses 6 the adverse secondary impacts of gas and oil exploration and extraction experienced by residents living nearby or adjacent to oil and gas development activities include obnoxious odors and lights  excessive noise  air soil and water contamination  contaminated drinking wells  excessive dust traffic and debris  off pad soil erosion  local road deterioration  and wildlife habitat impacts  all adversely affecting the residential quality of life and natural resources of the city 7 based on recent experiences in michigan cities it is recognized that state statutes and regulations do not adequately protect the health safety and welfare of city residents local natural resources and the community from the adverse impacts of oil and gas activities thereby necessitating local regulation under the citys zoning authority and general police powers of oil and gas development activities and all secondary impacts 8 the michigan zoning enabling act authorizes and empowers a local unit of government to provide by zoning ordinance for the regulation of land development and the establishment of one 1 or more districts within its zoning jurisdiction which regulate the use of land and structures to meet the needs of the states citizens for food fiber energy and other natural resources places of residences recreation industry trade service and other uses of land to ensure that the use of land is situated in appropriate locations and relationships and to promote the public health safety and welfare 9 the michigan constitution and statutes authorize the city to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to municipal concerns to protect the public health safety and welfare of its residents  to regulate activities that cause nuisances  to regulate activities or industries that impede upon others quality of life property values and health safety and public welfare  and to protect and preserve natural resources of the community 10 federal state and local laws impose a substantive duty on the city pursuant to its police powers and authority to prevent or minimize likely degradation of the air water and local natural resources held in the public trust 11 convincing evidence of the adverse secondary impacts of oil and gas development activities have been presented to the city in public meetings hearings in articles from experiences of neighboring communities and studies reports and court cases made available to the city 12 it is an established legal principal that a municipality may rely on studies reports and experiences and evidence generated by other communities of the adverse secondary impacts of certain establishments so long as whatever evidence that the municipality relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the municipality addresses renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 13 the courts have recognized that an ordinance furthers a substantial government interest by regulating adverse secondary impacts of certain establishments city of la v alameda books inc 535 us 425 14 courts have further recognized that proper exercise of police power is to relegate industrial establishments to locations separated from residential sections village of euclid ohio v amber realty co 272 us 365 1926 15 the reports studies and evidence presented to the city support the finding that oil and gas exploration extraction and development is an industrial activity that is associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary impacts including but not limited to the following industrial operations that run twentyfour 24 hours a day  obnoxious nighttime light emitted off site  obnoxious hydrocarbon odors andor hydrogen sulfide bearing gases emitted off site  obnoxious industrial noise emitted off site  excessive vibrations emitted off site  dust emitted off site  scattered debris on site that does not meet site maintenance standards of the community  truck traffic impeding flow of traffic and endangering pedestrian and nonmotorized travel within the community  excessive truck traffic resulting in accelerated damage to roads within the community  activities that disrupt wildlife and wildlife habitats  activities near public parks that impact the natural ecosystem and quiet enjoyment of nature paths trails and wildlife habitats  withdrawal of groundwater resulting in reducing the volume or amount of well water serving residential properties  withdrawal of groundwater resulting in impacts to the interconnected lakes streams ponds and wetlands within the community  contamination of groundwater surface water and drinking water supplies  contamination of environmentally sensitive areas  offsite soil erosion that causes nutrient degradation pollution and wildlife habitat impacts  activities that impact the natural course and flow of storm water runoff  environmental consequences from the storage and disposal of wastewater on site  environmental consequences from the loading unloading and offsite transport of waste and products  environmental consequences of wells and pipelines within or in close proximity to protected wetlands woodlands and environmentally sensitive areas within the city  and violations of provisions of the citys legally required master plan by forcing industrial conditions in residentially zoned areas b purposes as a result of the findings set forth herein and otherwise considered the city council has determined that it is necessary to provide for the reasonable establishment of land for oil and gas development while providing adequate and appropriate health safety and welfare protection of southfield residents accordingly it is necessary and appropriate to adopt reasonable requirements for oil and gas development and the appropriate zoning districts within which oil and gas wells and oil and gas development activities are permitted so that these resources can be obtained in a manner than protects the environment protects residential properties and residential property values and mitigates associated negative impacts this chpater is adopted pursuant to the powers granted to municipalities as set forth in article 7 section 7 of the constitution of the state of michigan and the powers given to municipalities to protect the public health safety and welfare home rule city act mcl 1174  and the michigan zoning enabling act 2006 pa 110 effective  mcl  et seq as amended the provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor the effect of prohibiting or controlling the drilling completion or operation of oil or gas wells or other wells drilled for oil or gas exploration purposes or to regulate the issuance of permits for the drilling completion operation or abandonment of oil or gas wells  and acknowledges the jurisdiction and authority of the supervisor of wells over the administration and enforcement of the natural resources environmental protection act nrepa public act 451 of 199 as amended mcl  et seq and matters relating to the prevention of waste and the conservation of oil and gas in this state however while the supervisor of wells has jurisdiction and control over persons and things necessary to enforce the nrepa and the prevention of waste and conservation of oil and gas such grant of authority does not abrogate the power and authority of the city under the michigan constitution the michigan zoning enabling act and statutory authority to protect the public health safety and welfare and to continue to regulate issues of local concern c necessity the city council declares that this section is essential to the health safety economic and general welfare of the people of the city and to the furtherance of the policy set forth in article 7 section 7 of the constitution of the state of michigan and powers given to municipalities to protect the public health safety and welfare of the

marihuana accordingly the licensure of a particular medical marihuana facility as the site of cultivation and distribution of marihuana which need not undermine the privacy and confidentiality of the

distribution or use of marihuana thus the authorization of activity in chapter 45 and the approval of a license under this chapter shall not have the effect of superseding or nullifying federal law applicable to the cultivation use and possession of marihuana and all applicants and grantees of licenses are on notice that they may be subject to prosecution and civil penalty including forfeiture

findings and purpose documented studies show that there is a correlation between electronic changeable copy signage and the distraction of drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can

distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as may be prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver

editors note  1 adopted  repealed former ch 103   in its entirety and added a new ch 103 former ch 103 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from adopted   and adopted  purpose intent and findings the purpose of this chapter is to help protect the health safety and welfare of city residents and citizens to prevent blight and property deterioration in neighborhoods and to promote and maintain healthy and sanitary conditions in all single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings located in the city recognizing the importance of such to the persons who do or may reside therein or in the vicinity the city also recognizes a compelling interest in establishing standards for the maintenance of sanitary and safe single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings within the city which will provide for the maintenance of property values of nearby properties  and the reduction and elimination of blight and other negative factors affecting neighborhoods and the quality of life within the city the city finds that the nature of singlefamily twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings versus multiplefamily and nonresidential rental buildings is unique because in the citys experience 1 the maintenance of single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings are typically the obligation of a nonowning tenant or a nonoccupying offsite owner rather than an onsite manager or management company  2 unlike nonresidential rental buildings and apartment units single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings are typically located in neighborhoods consisting of owneroccupied singlefamily dwelling units where the deterioration and nonmaintenance of homes has a much more significant and direct negative impact on the quality of life character vitality appearance and value of properties in the surrounding neighborhood affecting residents on a broad and large scale basis within the city  3 single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings are more often located in close proximity to other singlefamily residential structures and therefore have a greater effect on the general health safety and welfare of the citys residents  and 4 accordingly regulating single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings is the most effective way to reduce neighborhood and city blight with the resources available to the city thus in order to address this unique situation and help to protect residents of neighborhoods surrounding single and twofamily rental dwellings the city finds that a single and twofamily and townhouse rental dwelling registration and inspection program is warranted and necessary  1 32016 scope the provisions of this chapter shall apply to one and twofamily and townhouse rental dwellings including any accessory buildings or structures and the
