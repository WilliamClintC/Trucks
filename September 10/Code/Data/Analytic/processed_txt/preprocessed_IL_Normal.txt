the town of normal illinois and at times referred to as this  in this division as used herein city means town of normal sec 22132  purpose and intent it is the purpose of this address the negative impacts associated with sexuallyoriented entertainment businesses as identified in the legislative findings made and cited in of this reduce or prevent neighborhood blight  to protect and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods and commercial districts  to protect the citys retail trade  to maintain property values  to protect and preserve the quality of life in the city  to reduce the incidence of unlawful activity and to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city the provisions of this neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials for adults similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented entertainment for adults to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material sec 22133 findings the president and board of trustees make the following legislative findings a the courts of illinois as well as the united states supreme court have recognized the citys authority to adopt rules and regulations over the operation of sexually oriented entertainment business establishments  and b the city has a substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare of its citizens and all persons within the city and of propounding standards to mitigate the possibility of infection by contagious sexually transmitted diseases  and c there is convincing documented evidence including statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities in the state of illinois and in the united states concerning the serious objectionable characteristics and secondary effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses located in other jurisdictions the city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting ordinances to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of sexually oriented entertainment business establishments  and sec 22133cont1 d the city council finds that there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented entertainment businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes related to prostitution sale and possession of controlled substances and violence against persons and property these studies from other jurisdictions establish convincing evidence that sexually oriented entertainment business establishments if not regulated pursuant to the location and operational requirements set forth in the ordinances of the city can result in an increase in criminal activities and other adverse secondary effects with a deleterious impact on adjacent commercial and residential properties  and e the city council finds that enclosed or dimly lit areas within sexually oriented entertainment businesses greatly increases the potential for unlawful conduct such as prostitution sales of controlled substances and lewd and lascivious conduct and further finds that all indoor and enclosed public areas should be open to view by management and visible to all other public areas in the sexually oriented entertainment business establishment adequate lighting and direct management supervision of such areas are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and incidents of illegal conduct and facilitate routine inspection by public safety personnel  and f the city council in adopting this is aware of and takes legislative notice of wellestablished legal principles related to the regulation of sexually oriented entertainment businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution but instead intends to enact reasonable regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and g the city council finds that location and zoning regulations alone are insufficient to adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thereby finds that it is in the public interest to establish certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and h the city council finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that close contact between performers and patrons and the direct solicitation of and the direct giving of gratuities in sexually oriented business entertainment establishments facilitates the opportunity for specified criminal acts including but not limited to solicitations for sexual acts transfer of controlled substances and lewd and lascivious conduct and further finds that the enforcement of such laws prohibiting such specified criminal acts requires a disproportionate level of public safety resources  and i the city council finds the following based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record sec 22133cont2 1 evidence supports a finding that some dancers and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts as defined herein in sexually oriented entertainment businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in specified sexual activities with patrons of such sexuallyoriented entertainment businesses on the site of sexually oriented entertainment businesses  2 evidence demonstrates that performers employed by sexually oriented entertainment businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live entertainment exhibiting specified sexual activities or displaying specified anatomical parts as defined herein  3 evidence supports a finding that performers at sexually oriented entertainment businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the sexually oriented entertainment businesses  as a result of the above and in view of the increase in incidents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases std the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations that will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex at sexually oriented entertainment businesses  and j the city council finds that there are unique harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of sexually oriented entertainment businesses including but not limited to the deterioration of respect for family values exposure to images and acts for which they are too young or immature to fully understand exposure to items and displays containing pornography or sexually oriented toys or novelties and the possibility that

quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  b the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  c soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys washedout fills and embankments  d sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  e sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  f sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety  g development if not controlled causes increases in peak storm water runoff rates which can lead to increased stream bed and stream bank erosion and flooding in receiving streams  h erosion and stream bank instability caused by altered stream flow rates due to development can create unsafe conditions adverse environmental impacts and other conditions that require costly repairs or preventative measures to protect private and public structures and facilities  i the federal water pollution control act amendments of 197 197 and subsequent amendments commonly known as the clean water act require local erosion control and
