ordinance  intent and purpose a the city council of the city of crescent city under the citys police powers has the authority to enact and enforce laws that promote the public health safety and general welfare of its residents the occurrence of social gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons is harmful to the underage persons involved and a threat to public health and safety to the quiet enjoyment of residential property and to the general welfare underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the underage consumption of alcohol b the city council finds that in too many cases persons having possession or control of private property and who are responsible for social gatherings on that property have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these gatherings the city council further finds that problems associated with social gatherings where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons are difficult to prevent and deter unless law enforcement personnel have the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering and to cite the responsible persons c law enforcement personnel have in the past been required to respond to unruly gatherings on private property at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons these calls for service result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and delay official responses to other calls in the rest of the city d an ordinance that imposes liability on property owners and other responsible persons for gatherings that allow underage drinking is necessary to deter and prevent such gatherings persons who actively or passively aid allow or tolerate such gatherings should be held liable for permitting such gatherings the nuisances created by them and the costs associated with responding to them e the purposes of this chapter include protecting the public health safety and welfare by deterring the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons and by reducing the costs to the public of providing law enforcement response services to unruly gatherings and gatherings of underage persons where alcohol is served both in terms of monetary costs and availability of law enforcement personnel for other calls f these purposes are implemented by the imposition of criminal penalties for social hosts as well as the imposition of administrative penalties for social hosts and landowners including landlords and the imposition of fees to recover the costs incurred by the city in providing law enforcement responses to gatherings where alcohol is served to or consumed by underage persons at properties where previous such gatherings have required law enforcement responses g for these reasons the city council declares that gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons are a threat to the public peace health safety and general welfare and a public nuisance because they affect at the same time the entire community as well as the neighborhoods in which they occur  2013

categorical pretreatment standards set forth at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections e and f b where the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the pretreatment coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d a categorical industrial user may obtain a net or a gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard pursuant to this section 1 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users source water any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for source pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the source water if the requirements of subsection d2 of this section are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the source waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total suspended solids tss and oil and grease will not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the source water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit will be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with categorical pretreatment standards adjusted under this section d credit will be granted only if the user demonstrates that the source water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in paragraphs 1a e below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the users actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the users longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection f1 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph 1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit f when developing equivalent mass limits the pretreatment coordinator 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to the industrial user must also be in compliance with the prohibition of bypass g the pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator h once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived i many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation j any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the pretreatment coordinator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the pretreatment coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate  2010  state pretreatment standards state requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter  2010  local limits the pretreatment coordinator is authorized to establish local limits pursuant

most recent local limits resolution available at city hall and on the city webpage  the local limits apply at the point where wastewater is discharged to the potw the pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations in addition to or instead of the concentrationbased limitations the pretreatment coordinator is authorized to set iuspecific limits for pollutants on a casebycase basis the loading allocation will be based on the dischargers current loading its need for a continued loading allocation its ability to apply pretreatment to achieve certain discharge pollutant levels ie treatability or any other factor that the pretreatment coordinator determines is relevant the pretreatment coordinator will ensure that the sum of the allocated loadings does not exceed the current maximum allowable industrial loading mail to ensure that it does not allocate more than the mail crescent city will monitor loading from ius with individual wastewater discharge permits the city will monitor and compare actual loading to the allocated mails upon receipt of any discharge monitoring data on an annual basis the pretreatment coordinator may develop best management practices bmps by

flood damage prevention  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of crescent city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations u  3 2018  findings and purpose a the flood hazard areas of the city of crescent city have been subject to periodic inundation which has resulted in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which has adversely affected the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood height sand velocities also contributes to flood losses b it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions c in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods provisions and regulations for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood

from the requirements of this chapter b the planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the director of community development of this chapter c those aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the city council d conditions for variances variances may be issued when necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation rehabilitation or reconstruction variances issued for economic considerations aesthetics or because variances have been used in the past are not good and sufficient cause u  3 2018      nature of variances a the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance b the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners c it is the duty of the planning commission to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate u  3 2018  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the del norte county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency u  3 2018  criteria for variances a in passing upon requests for variances the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense or create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the planning commission may

factors will vary depending on whether the request is being made in a residential or commercial zoning district and they can only include the physical impacts of the proposed use not the type of residents the factors to be considered for reasonable accommodation include the following 1 special needs created by the disability 2 potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested accommodation 3 potential impact of the request on surrounding uses 4 potential hazardous impact of surrounding environment upon the requested accommodation 5 physical attributes of the property and structures 6 alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit 7 in the case of a determination involving a single family dwelling whether the household would be considered a

particular consideration given to the following issues a residential character if the accommodation is requested in a residential zoning district then it is reasonable to require that the house retain a residential character this means that its interior and exterior design should be consistent with the style of residential structures around it in order to promote a cohesive living environment homes should contain sufficient common areas for the number of residents including at a minimum a kitchen dining area and living room large enough to serve the residents and in the case of larger residences congregating or recreational rooms and adequate bathrooms b parking recognizing that the parking demand for persons with disabilities is often less than for a similarly situated nondisabled household

estuarine rivers streams tributaries creeks and flood control and drainage channels b types of public access 1 vertical access provides public access from the first public road trail or public use area nearest the sea to the publicly owned shoreline tidelands or established lateral access perpendicular to the shore 2 lateral access provides for public access and use along or parallel to the shoreline 3 blufftop access provides access and coastal viewing along blufftops that run parallel to the shoreline and in some cases provide the only opportunity for public access along the shoreline above a rocky intertidal zone with no sandy beach 4 trail access provides public access ie hiking biking and equestrian along a coastal or mountain recreational path including to and along canyons rivers streams wetlands lagoons freshwater marshes significant habitat and open space areas or similar resource areas and which also may link inland trails or recreational facilities to the shoreline 5 recreational access provides public access to coastal recreational resources other than those listed above including but not limited to parking facilities viewing platforms and blufftop parks c character of accessway use 1 pass and repass refers to the right of the public to walk and run along an accessway because this use limitation can substantially restrict the publics ability to enjoy adjacent publicly owned tidelands by restricting the potential use of lateral accessways it will be applied only in connection with vertical access or other types of access where the findings required by a090 of this chapter establish that the limitation is necessary to protect natural habitat values topographic features such as eroding bluffs or privacy of the landowner 2 passive recreational use refers to those recreational activities typically associated with coastal open space that generally are nonstructured and require minimal or no developed facilities or improvements to land such activities include but are not limited to walking biking jogging hiking dog walking bird watching tidepooling beach combing informal sports activities such as frisbee or ball throwing and kiteflying nature viewing and picnicking passive recreation includes ancillary facilities necessary to support visitor access to the coastal open space including but not limited to parking lots interpretive signage visitor kiosks restrooms etc passive recreation activities do not include activities such as playgrounds community gardens ballfields skate parks etc 3 active recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct the full range of beachoriented activities not including horseback riding and use of motorized vehicles unless specifically authorized 1 1784a040 general provisions a

include but are not limited to the use of dry sand and rocky beaches to the first line of terrestrial vegetation b access requirements proposed development and new land uses located between the ocean the first public road may be required to provide vertical perpendicular access from the public road to bluff and beach areas and lateral access along the beach shoreline and blufftops where the review authority first makes specific findings documenting the need for additional public access on andor site and the relationship of the required dedication to the impacts on existing access or needs for additional access created by the project c exceptions to access requirements coastal access requirements may be waived by the review authority based upon specific findings that the provision of public access would be inappropriate because 1 it would be inconsistent with public safety or the protection of fragile coastal resources  2 adequate access exists within onefourthmile of the site  3 access at the site would be inconsistent with the policies of the coastal land use plan other than those requiring access  or 4 requiring or providing the access would be inconsistent with federal or state law d timing of access implementation the type and extent of access to be dedicated andor constructed and maintained as well as the method by which its continuing availability for public use is to be guaranteed shall be established at the time of land use permit approval as provided by this section 1 dedication shall occur before issuance of construction permits and before the start of any

lateral easement extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation for one or more of the types of access identified in a030b of this chapter shall be required and shall be supported by findings required by a090 of this chapter  provided that no such condition of approval shall be imposed if the analysis required by a090 of this chapter establishes that the development will not adversely affect either individually or cumulatively the ability of the public to reach and use public tidelands and coastal resources or that the access dedication requirement will not alleviate the access burdens identified for any project where such mitigation is required the preferred implementation shall be recorded grant of easement to the city other government agency or to a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the city and the executive director of the coastal commission who is willing to accept the easement and willing to open operate and maintain the public accessway or trail where grants of easement are not feasible because neither the city other government agency nor private

feasible less environmentally damaging project alternative that would avoid impacts to public access b protection of existing coastal access development shall not interfere with public rights of access to the sea where the rights were acquired or legislative authorization public access rights may include but are not limited to the use of dry sand and rocky beaches to the first line of terrestrial vegetation c exceptions to access requirements coastal access requirements may be waived by the review authority based upon specific findings that the provision of public access would be inappropriate because 1 it would be inconsistent with public safety military security needs or the protection of fragile coastal resources  2 adequate access exists within onefourthmile of the site  3 access at the site would be inconsistent with policies of the coastal land use plan other than those requiring access  4 requiring or providing the access would be inconsistent with federal or state law 1 1784a060 access design standards the standards of this section are intended to provide guidance to the review authority in determining the appropriate design of accessways to be required by coastal development permit conditions of approval in compliance with this chapter a design objectives the following are general guidelines as to the size and nature of all public access facilities in the city 1 design and siting accessways and trails should be sited and designed a to minimize alteration of natural landforms conform to the existing contours of the land and to subordinate to the character of their setting  b to prevent unwarranted hazards to the land and public safety  c to provide for the privacy of adjoining residences and to minimize conflicts with adjacent or nearby established uses  and d to prevent damage to sensitive coastal resource areas 2 correction of existing damagealternative routes where appropriate coastal accessways should be designed to correct damage resulting from past and existing use shoreline and blufftop trail segments that may not be passable at all times shall provide inland alternative routes 3 accessway specifications a width each public access easement offered for dedication for public use shall be a minimum of twentyfive feet wide for vertical easements and extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation for lateral easements the area where public access is allowed within an easement may be reduced to the minimum necessary for pedestrian traffic to avoid i adverse impacts on sensitive environmental areas  ii encroachment closer than twenty feet to an existing residence  andor iii hazardous topographic conditions b slope the preferred slope gradient for the walking surface of an accessway is zero to twenty percent and in no case should exceed seventy percent c overhead clearance the minimum overheard clearance for an accessway shall be seven feet 4 access for disabled persons wherever possible wheelchair access to the ocean shall be provided ramps should have dimensions and gradients consistent with current ada requirements 5 residential privacy the design and placement of access trails should provide for the privacy of adjacent residences accessways may be wide enough to allow the placement of a trail fencing and a landscape buffer 6 parking where access sites are required parking should be provided where feasible where handicapped beach access is provided one out of five parking spaces should be provided for disabled persons these spaces should be marked clearly for handicapped use only 7 signs directional signing advising the public of vertical lateral and blufftop accessways and parking should be placed in prominent locations along access routes at appropriate places in the downtown and at major visitor destinations signs designating handicapped access points and parking should be conspicuous potential hazards along accessways such as steep cliffs steps or slopes should be signed and fenced when necessary b standards for application of access conditions the public access required pursuant to a050a of this chapter shall conform to the following standards and requirements as applicable to the type of access facility 1 vertical access a vertical accessway shall comply with the following standards in addition to the other applicable requirements of this section a minimum requirements a condition to require vertical public access as a condition of approval of a

require vertical access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit or other authorization to proceed with development pursuant to a050a of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of vertical access and be limited to the public right of passive recreational use unless another character of use is specified as a condition of the development in determining whether another character of use is appropriate findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in a090b of this chapter c each vertical accessway shall extend from the public road to the shoreline or bluff edge and shall be legally described as required in a080d of this chapter the vertical access easement shall be a minimum of twentyfivefeetwide and extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation for the lateral easement wherever feasible if a residential structure is proposed the accessway should be sited along the border or side property line of the project site or away from existing or proposed development and should not be sited closer than ten feet to the structure wherever feasible exceptions to siting a vertical accessway along a border or side property line or not closer than ten feet to a structure may be required where topographical physical or other constraints exist on the site 2 lateral access a lateral accessway shall comply with the following standards in addition to the other applicable requirements of this section a minimum requirements a condition to require lateral access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit or other authorization to proceed with development pursuant to a050a of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of lateral public access and passive recreational use along the shoreline or public recreational area bikeway or blufftop area as applicable active recreational use may be appropriate in many cases where the development is determined to be especially burdensome on public access examples include cases where the burdens of the proposed project would severely impact public recreational use of the shoreline where the proposed development is not one of the priority uses specified in public resources where active recreational uses reflect the historic public use of

any means available at law  2016  violations any violation of this chapter except as it relates to marijuana cultivation shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as provided in  2016 cannabis cultivation for personal or medical use  findings a the city of crescent city and other public agencies have reported adverse impacts from cultivation including but not limited to disagreeable odors negative effects on physical mental and community health  violation of building codes and other land development codes  increased risk of burglary and other property crimes  and acts of violence in connection with the commission of such crimes or the occupants attempts to prevent such crimes b the creation of persistent strong odors as cannabis plants mature and flower is offensive to many people results in complaints of respiratory problems and generally creates an attractive nuisance by alerting persons including children to the location of valuable cannabis plants and creating an increased risk of crime c children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use and the presence of cannabis plants is an attractive nuisance for children creating an unreasonable hazard in areas frequented by children including schools parks and other similar locations further the potential for criminal activities associated with cannabis cultivation in such locations poses heightened risks that children will be involved or endangered d the indoor cultivation of substantial amounts of cannabis within a residence presents potential health and safety risks to those living in the residence especially children including but not limited to increased risk of fire from grow light systems  potential adverse effects on the structural integrity of a building  exposure to fertilizers pesticides and antifungusmold agents  and exposure to potential property crimes targeting the residence e the production of concentrated cannabis and extraction of compounds from cannabis using alcohol or flammable liquids or gases has caused numerous fires and explosions throughout california causing injury to both people and property f the right of qualified patients and their primary caregivers under state law to cultivate cannabis plants for medical purposes does not confer upon them the right to create or maintain a public nuisance by limiting the cultivation area for indoor medical cannabis cultivation to a single space no larger than fifty square feet in a single room and limiting cannabis plants to a single layer the city anticipates a reduction in the negative secondary effects of unfettered growing such as odor fire crime and pollution g limiting the area of indoor cultivation to fifty square feet is necessary because the lights and electricity required by cultivation areas larger than fifty square feet are likely to exceed the wattage supported by a typical household light and receptacle circuit thereby creating an unreasonable risk to public health safety and welfare and a public nuisance hazard of fire and overloading of circuits h prohibiting the outdoor cultivation of cannabis is necessary because outdoor cannabis cultivation would create an unreasonable risk of causing a public nuisance i limiting the number of medicinal cannabis plants or medicinal cannabis cultivation space available to a qualified patient or primary caregiver is not intended to preclude a qualified patient or primary caregiver from obtaining collectives or other legal means additional medicinal cannabis that the qualified patient needs for his or her reasonable medical use j limiting the number of personal cannabis plants cultivated indoors for personal use and the total wattage of lights used for cultivation is necessary because cultivating cannabis plants in excess of six plants and with unlimited total wattage would create an unreasonable risk of fire danger caused by highwattage grow lights and excessive use of electricity k requiring indoor cultivation to be secured in a locked space increases the possibility that cannabis grown for purposes that are legal under state law remains secure and will not be distributed to minors or in illicit markets l by limiting the amount of medicinal cannabis that a qualified patient or primary caregiver may possess to up to eight ounces or the amount that is reasonably related to the qualified patients current medical needs the city seeks to reduce the harms that come with possession of larger amounts including illegal sales accompanying crimes and illegal cultivation practices m it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to implement state law by providing a means for regulating the cultivation of medicinal and personal use cannabis in a manner that is consistent with state law and which balances the needs of medical patients and their caregivers and the interests of personal use cultivators while promoting the health safety and welfare of the residents and businesses within the incorporated city of crescent city this chapter is intended to prohibit the cultivation of cannabis by anyone for any purpose other than by a qualified patient primary caregiver or personal use cultivator cultivating in strict compliance with this chapter and applicable state law this chapter is not intended to prohibit persons from exercising any right otherwise granted by state law including but not limited to proposition 215 senate bill 420 proposition 64 and senate bill 94 rather the intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable regulations upon the manner in which cannabis for medicinal or personal purposes may be cultivated including restrictions on the amount of cannabis that may be cultivated in any location or premises in order to protect the public health and safety n the limited right of qualified patients and their primary caregivers and personal use cultivators under state law to cultivate cannabis plants for medicinal purposes or personal use does not confer the right to create or maintain a public nuisance by adopting the regulations in this ordinance the city will achieve a significant reduction in the aforementioned harms caused or threatened by unregulated cultivation of cannabis in the city of crescent city o nothing in this chapter may be construed to allow the cultivation of cannabis for purposes other than medicinal and personal use or allow any activity relating to the cultivation distribution or consumption of cannabis that is illegal under state law  2018  definitions as used in this chapter the following terms
