objectives  sterling codifiers inc  601767 the need and purpose for establishment of suitable controls for the development of new land areas in and about our cities has been well stated by the housing and home finance agency in its publication suggested land subdivision regulations and the following is a quotation from that publication the regulations of land subdivision for residential and other uses is widely accepted as a function of municipal and county government in the united states it has become widely recognized as a method of insuring sound community growth and the safeguarding of the interests of the homeowner the subdivider and the local government the business of building a city and this includes its environs requires the safeguarding of these interests and the assurance that residential land subdivision will provide permanent assets to the locality a large part of land subdivision and development continues to occur in unincorporated areas and so the regulations of land subdivision is of as great a concern to unincorporated areas as it is to incorporated areas subdivision regulations should prevent excessive governmental operating costs at the same time they should assure to the maximum degree possible the means whereby land can be developed for the highest possible use with all of the necessary protections against deterioration and obsolescence regulations for control of land subdivision are instruments of local government which require the greatest amount of cooperation between the landowner who wishes to subdivide and the municipality or county within which such subdivision is to take place this manual is intended to provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working relationship for both the government officials interested in and responsible for sound community development and the landowner who intends to subdivide for whatever purpose the subdivision of land is a technical and business venture which not only affects the immediate return to the investor in land and the value of the land on which he may wish to build but it also involves for the local government specific items of cost and income for the years to come which must be weighed at the time that a subdivision is under consideration this publication is expected to help guide the preparation of the regulations which a locality may wish to adopt it covers the technical elements of land subdivision control designed to assure the maximum return on the local governments investment and at the same time to assure the subdivider full consideration of his interests and responsibilities in order to understand the objectives of subdivision control regulations it is first necessary to recognize that a wide variety of interests are concerned and that these interests will vary in intensity from community to community and in relation to different subdivision proposals within a community brief consideration of some of those interests and their relation to each other will facilitate the use of this manual the landowner or developer a subdivision proposal or project is initiated by the owner of the land or by a builderdeveloper or real estate operator who has a financial interest in the development sale or lease of the subdivision in whole or in part such sale or lease involves business transactions between the subdivider and his client and the subdivider and the local government while the financing of such business transactions may take an infinite number of forms the ultimate objective is the same the disposal of the subdivided land at a profit to the owner or developer therefore it is mandatory that subdivision regulations recognize the fundamental financial interests of both the seller and the purchaser and that such regulations do not impose undue hardships which would impair land salability the investor the investor in land may be an individual purchaser of one or more lots a mortgage bank an insurance company or an agency of the federal government which acquires financial interest either insurance or other means it is to the interest of these investors that the subdivision is not only financially feasible but that there should be a certain guarantee of the continuing success of the project in order that there may be a continued return on the investment and in order that satisfactory interest rates and amortization charges may be levied it is important to recognize also that generally the life of a subdivision is as long as the life of a city and that during this indefinite and extensive period of years properties are continually changing  sterling codifiers inc  602767 hands and investments are continually being made in land and buildings it is to the communitys best interests including the interests of both private enterprise and local government to see that every subdivision is so well designed and constructed that it does not ultimately become a charge against the community and that it does not become a liability instead of an asset thus adversely affecting the local tax base one of the errors committed in the past by local governments in the management of the subdivision development process has been the lack of recognition of the longterm responsibilities involved in the platting of land and the laying out of streets and other facilities and services a quick sale may provide for a quick profit to the subdivider however this gain may be offset by the cost to the community of installing facilities that require increased taxation the wise real estate operator investor and public official will take these matters into consideration from the very beginning the homeowner to the homeowner sound subdivision regulations provide a protection of his special interest from the beginning the safeguarding of the character of a development of adequate block design street layout lot layout and the provision of adequate utilities and community services supplies a stability to the value of the homeowners investment and safeguards his family life too often we have seen evidences of deterioration of neighborhoods because of bad platting and inadequate subdivision and zoning protection as the costs of municipal management rise it becomes more and more important that we provide means of stabilizing residential values the constant movement of people from one neighborhood to another and the loss of value can be minimized by the development of sound and attractive neighborhoods the local government interests there are several governmental officials responsible for an interest in land subdivision in every community there is no attempt here to provide an exhaustive listing however it is essential to indicate wherein responsibilities may lie and where there will be interest in the use of this manual both in the drafting of subdivision regulations and in their administration it is important of course for local government interests to exercise judgment and care in order to assure that all their standards and requirements are appropriate in all cases these standards should be reasonable and equitable in the interest of the developer investor and homeowner as well as the local government  912 application of regulations no person shall subdivide any tract of land which is located within the city or in any unincorporated area which is

any other documentation requirements including elevations cross sections and other plan details deemed appropriate by the city c design guidelines in preparing landscape plans the following shall be followed 1 general landscape design principles a landscape improvements should serve to integrate the project to the site with particular sensitivity to the natural topography watercourses and existing vegetation preservation of the existing landscape material and landforms shall be taken into account particularly where mature trees are a part of the site this is of particular importance in cases where specimen trees groves or tree lines or tree lined watercourses are present b landscape improvements should serve to enhance the appearance of the site especially as viewed from an adjacent public right of way effective year round screening shall be provided to lessen the visual prominence of parking lots service yards loading docks public utility structures and unsightly appurtenances c innovative landscape design proposals that promote sustainability reduce irrigation requirements and that utilize effective on site stormwater management techniques are encouraged thoughtful selection and placement of plant material and ground covers based on ecological principles are also encouraged d the aesthetic aspect of landscape improvements shall be considered both at installation and maturity groupings of trees or other plantings are recommended for optimal visual effect and ease of maintenance 2 scale scale and nature of landscape materials and planting bed size should be appropriate to the site and structures larger buildings and sites may accommodate and be enhanced by larger plant material plant groupings and planting beds 3 selection and layout plant material shall be selected for its form texture color and concern for its size at maturity wherever possible large planting areas shall be provided in groupings and masses to provide a more naturalistic appearance wherever appropriate use of native woody and herbaceous plant materials is encouraged in small planting areas within parking lots trees and shrubs shall be planted in groups with massing appropriate to and in harmony with buildings circulation stormwater management and neighboring landscapes energy conservation shall also be considered when determining layout of selection and layout of plant material for instance sun tolerant plant materials should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from summer sun and shade tolerant plant materials should be concentrated on the north side of buildings to dissipate the effects of winter winds 4 stormwater infiltration and enhanced water quality wherever possible preserve restore and integrate natural drainage patterns and features including swales filter strips and wetlands or rain gardens vegetated with native plant systems the intention shall be to slow stormwater runoff increase on site  sterling codifiers inc  759767 infiltration and filter suspended solids and contaminants in support of on site stormwater management and treatment strategies that reduce or control costs to the community 5 berming earthen berms and existing topography shall whenever practical be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site bermed areas shall be designed to resemble natural landforms whenever possible the maximum permissible slope is four to one  6 facade treatments landscape improvements shall be provided to enhance architectural features and to add visual interest adjacent to large expanses of building walls landscape improvements shall also be provided as a buffer between pedestrian and vehicular activity at primary building entrances and along building facades 7 fence treatments when fencing is used provide landscaping which includes a variety of plant material height color and texture this landscaping should buffer soften or minimize the visual monotony of long expanses of fencing 8 miscellaneous screening standards functional activities within and adjoining the development site must be considered in the design of the landscape improvements including consideration of the following trash dumpsters or other waste receptacles all utility equipment dish antennas loading docks or other outdoor service areas and ground signs particular attention shall be paid towards screening mechanical equipment air conditioning units or any other visible outside equipment service areas including dumpster enclosures loading docks and bicycle parking areas enhance walkways entrances seating areas bus stops or any other pedestrian areas  separate and buffer pedestrian and public areas from circulation drives and parking areas  and direct attention to focal areas and main entrances 9 miscellaneous placement standards there shall be a three foot 3 radius free of trees or shrubs around fire hydrants valve vaults hose bibs manholes hydrants fire department connections and other site features as deemed necessary by the city additionally plant material branching higher than two feet 2 and lower than six feet 6 above top of curb shall not be planted or maintained in a sight visibility triangle as defined by the superintendent of public works or hisher designee 10 texture plants differ in texture according to foliage color size and density a variety of textures will add interest and depth to the landscape design for example coarser plants larger leaves dense foliage may work to anchor corners medium textured materials can gradually transition to fine textured plants in massing coarser textured plants are usually more effective when placed at greater distances from common viewing locations groups of finer textured plants are typically more effective near walkways and entrances and in courtyards of buildings or plazas 11 form among the most important design qualities of a plant is form which includes columnar round vase weeping pyramidal and oval forms plants of contrasting shapes may provide variety and interest by accenting a group of plants of another form evergreen trees exhibit pyramidal forms while many crabapples are round to oval plantings that combine two 2 or more forms may effectively buffer or soften building facades fences and other structures the dominant use of native trees and shrubs that display strongly horizontal branch patterns and layered flowering forms is basic to effective use of the unified prairie style associated historically and ecologically with this region and is encouraged 12 color color can be used to unify or contrast plantings on a site it is essential to consider the varying colors exhibited by a plant in all seasons most importantly use of perennials andor annuals color can be used to call attention to entryways and other focal points 13 repetition a design is tied together repeated use of a small number of plant species sizes colors forms or textures throughout the site too much repetition can result in monotony so it is important to find a balance natural landscaping techniques using a diverse palette of randomly mixed prairie forbs and grasses will provide repetition and
