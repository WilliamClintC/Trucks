storage depths above the planting bed surface are typically shallow the adopted tss removal rate for bioretention systems is 90% b bioretention systems are used to remove a wide range of pollutants such as suspended solids nutrients metals hydrocarbons and bacteria from stormwater runoff they can also be used to reduce peak runoff rates and increase stormwater infiltration when designed as a multistage multifunction facility 1 predesign site evaluation  25656 sales special  25657  a for infiltration trench and structure practices a minimum field infiltration rate fc of 052 inch per hour

this permeability rate must be determined by field or laboratory testing since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two shall be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soil bed material is four incheshour the design rate would be two inches per hour ie four inches per hourtwo this design rate would then be used to compute the systems stormwater quality design storm drain time c planting soil bed the planting soil bed provides the environment for water and nutrients to be made available to the vegetation the soil particles can

volume within 72 hours filter fabric should be placed along the sides of the planting soil bed to prevent the migration of soil particles from the adjacent soil into the planting soil bed d vegetation the vegetation in a bioretention system removes some of the nutrients and other pollutants in the stormwater inflow the use of native plant material is recommended for bioretention systems wherever possible the goal of the planting plan should be to simulate a forestshrub community of primarily upland type in general trees should dominate the perimeter zone that is subject to less frequent inundation shrubs and herbaceous species that are adapted to moister conditions and expected pollutant loads should be selected for the wetter zones the number of stems per acre should average 1000

be inspected at least annually for erosion and scour vegetated areas should also be inspected at least annually for unwanted growth which should be removed with minimum disruption to the planting soil bed and remaining vegetation b when establishing or restoring vegetation biweekly inspections of vegetation health should be performed during the first growing season or until the vegetation is established once established inspections of vegetation health density and diversity should be performed at least twice annually during both the growing and nongrowing seasons the vegetative cover should be maintained at 85% if vegetation has greater than 50% damage the area should be reestablished in accordance with the original specifications and the inspection requirements presented above c all use of fertilizers mechanical treatments pesticides and other means to assure optimum vegetation health should not compromise the intended purpose of the bioretention system all vegetation

erosion and deterioration at least annually a an infiltration structure is a facility constructed within highly permeable soils that provides temporary storage of stormwater runoff an infiltration structure does not normally have a structural outlet to discharge runoff from the stormwater quality design storm instead outflow from an infiltration structure is surrounding soil an infiltration structure may also be combined with an extended detention structure to provide additional runoff storage for both stormwater quality and quantity management the adopted tss removal rate for infiltration structures is 80% b infiltration structures are used to remove pollutants and to infiltrate stormwater back into the ground such infiltration also helps to reduce increases in both the peak rate and total volume of runoff caused by land development pollutant removal is achieved of  25657 sales special  25658  the runoff soil as well as biological and chemical activity within the soil 1 predesign site evaluation a infiltration structures can present some practical design problems when planning for an infiltration structure that provides stormwater quality treatment consideration should be given to soil characteristics depth to the groundwater table sensitivity of the region and runoff water quality specifically infiltration structures must not be used in the following locations  industrial and commercial areas where solvents andor petroleum products are loaded unloaded stored or applied or pesticides are loaded unloaded or stored  areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than reportable quantities as defined by the united states environmental protection agency in the federal regulations at 40 cfr 3024  areas where infiltration structure use would be inconsistent with an njdep approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan  areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities  areas where industrial stormwater runoff is exposed to source material source material means any materials or machinery located at an industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater source materials include but are not limited to raw materials intermediate products final products waste materials byproducts industrial machinery and fuels and lubricants solvents and detergents that are related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater  areas where their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding cause surficial flooding of groundwater or interfere with the operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures such adverse impacts must be assessed and avoided by the design engineer b infiltration structures must be configured and located where their construction will not compact the soils below the structure in addition an infiltration structure must not be  25658 roseville code

general county soil surveys can be used to obtain necessary soil data for the planning and preliminary design of infiltration structures for final design and construction soil tests are required at the exact location of a proposed structure in order to confirm its ability to function without failure  tests should include a determination of the textural classification b permeability of the subgrade soil at and below the bottom of the proposed infiltration structure  the recommended minimum depth for subgrade soil analysis is five feet below the bottom of the structure or to the groundwater table soil permeability testing can be conducted in accordance with the standards for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems 2 design criteria a storage volume depth and duration  an infiltration structure must be designed to treat the total runoff volume generated by the structures maximum design storm this may either be the groundwater recharge or stormwater quality design storm depending upon the structures proposed use an infiltration structure must also fully drain this runoff volume within 72 hours runoff storage for greater times can render the structure ineffective and may result in anaerobic  25658 sales special  25658  conditions odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems the bottom of the infiltration structure must be at least two feet above seasonal high water table or bedrock for surface structures this distance must be measured from the bottom of the sand layer the structure bottom must be as level as possible to uniformly distribute runoff infiltration over the subgrade soils  to enhance safety by minimizing standing water depths the vertical distance between the structure bottom and the maximum design stormwater surface in surface infiltration structures should be no greater than two feet construction of an infiltration structure must be done without compacting the structures subgrade soils excavation must be performed by equipment placed outside the structure whenever possible this requirement should be considered when designing the dimensions and total storage volume of an infiltration structure it is important to note that the use of infiltration structures is recommended only for the stormwater quality design storm and smaller storm events use of infiltration structures for larger storm events and the requirements by which such structures are to be designed constructed and maintained should be reviewed and approved by all applicable reviewing agencies b permeability rates  the minimum design permeability rate of the soils below an infiltration structure will depend upon the structures location and maximum design storm the use of infiltration structures for stormwater quality control is feasible only where soil is sufficiently permeable to allow a reasonable rate of infiltration therefore infiltration structures designed for storms greater than the groundwater recharge

fully drain the infiltration structures maximum design storm runoff volume within 72 hours this design permeability rate must be determined by field testing see  25657b1 bioretention predesign site evaluation since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two must be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soils is four inches per hour the design rate would be two inches per hour ie four inches per hour two this design rate would then be used to compute the structures maximum design storm drain time c bottom sand layer to help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time a sixinch layer of sand must be placed on the bottom of an infiltration structure this sand layer can intercept silt sediment and debris that could otherwise clog the top layer of the soil below the structure the sand layer will also facilitate silt sediment and debris removal from the structure and can be readily restored following removal operations the sand layer must meet the specifications of a mdot class ii sand this must be certified by a certified testing lab d overflows all infiltration structures must be able to convey overflows to downstream drainage systems in a safe and stable manner the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow e subsurface infiltration structures a subsurface infiltration structure is located entirely below the ground surface it may consist of a vault perforated pipe andor stone bed however due to the greater difficulty in removing silt sediment and debris all runoff to a subsurface infiltration structure must be pretreated this pretreatment

storage facilities are designed to detain runoff for a short period of time and then release it to a watercourse where it returns to the hydrologic cycle the objective of detention storage is to regulate the released runoff rate and to reduce the impact on downstream drainage systems detention storage should not be confused with retention storage ie retention basins a facility with no engineered  25658 roseville code  25659  outlet other than an emergencytype outlet designed to hold runoff for a considerable length of time the water in a retention basin is not discharged to surface

protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under 18 years of age from possessing tobacco products and vapor products and prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and vapor products to persons under 18 years of age b persons under age 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors however tobaccoless products 222 editors note see ch 1 general provisions art i  31015 roseville code  3131  commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking and ingest nicotine these products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people c studies by the fda have determined that ecigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks the use of ecigarettes and similar devices has increased significantly in recent years as evidenced by the fact that 1 between 2011 and 201 the percentage of all youth in grades 6 to 12 who had tried electronic smoking devices doubled 2 68% of all youth between sixth and 12th grade report trying electronic smoking devices 3 10% of high school students have tried electronic smoking devices 4 93% of youth who have used electronic smoking devices have never smoked conventional cigarettes 5 between 2010 and 201 rates of both awareness and use of unregulated electronic smoking devices by adults also increased significantly 6 the 2014 survey conducted by monitoring the future released on  by the national institute on drug abuse revealed recent use by 87% of eighth graders 162% of 10th graders and 171% of 12th graders d existing studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including 1 chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium 2 pm25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke 3 inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products 4 in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans  3131 telecommunications  3131  e some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine and as a result 1 in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans 2 poisonings from electronic smoking devices have increased dramatically in the last 3 12 years from one a month in september 2010 to 215 a month in february 2014 3 analysis of reports of poisonings from electronic smoking devices finds that calls reporting exposure to electronic smoking devices are much more likely to involve adverse health effects when compared to calls reporting exposure to conventional cigarettes f clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to the food and drug administration for the over 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers currently have no way of knowing 1 whether electronic smoking devices are safe 2 what types or concentrations of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain 3 what dose of nicotine the products deliver g the world health organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body h the world medical association has determined that electronic smoking devices are not comparable to scientificallyproven methods of smoking cessation and that neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established i in september of 201 40 state attorneys general including michigans signed a letter to the commissioner of the united states food and drug administration outlining their concerns with ecigarettes and requesting the implementation of regulations that would address the advertising ingredients and sale to minors of ecigarettes at the federal level j it is the intent of the city council in enacting this chapter to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and  3131 roseville code  3131   3132 definitions for the purpose of construction

dust noise vibration and traffic and to assure that once the excavation operation is complete or otherwise abandoned the land will be rehabilitated and restored in such a manner that it will not result in dangerous or unsightly conditions which could be detrimental to the general health safety and welfare of residents and property owners in the city since the e1 extractive district is

permitted subject to the conditions herein set forth a in the residential districts onefamily cluster housing shall be permitted on property containing at least one net usable acre of land that has direct frontage access to a major or secondary thoroughfare as designated on the citys master plan map and provided further that the planning commission upon review of an application shall find that at least one of the following additional conditions exists on the site 1 the irregular or dimensionally restricted shape of the parcel makes it impractical or unconventional to develop the land under the normal subdivision approach because it would a result in the platting of undersized lots requiring variances to the minimum lot area and lot width requirements of the district b result in the establishment of public rightsofway that would be detrimental to adjacent existing development and to the functional movement of traffic within the site 2 development of the site under the normal subdivision approach would create unconventional lot shapes making them difficult to develop or would be so shaped that portions of the lot would be left unused creating potential maintenance problems 3 development under the normal subdivision approach would destroy or substantially diminish a natural asset of environmental significance which could be more fully preserved under the cluster housing option 4 the planning commission upon review of alternative development layouts finds that development under the cluster housing option will result in a more orderly and appropriate use of the land by showing a better relationship between dwelling units on site and adjacent land use off site will provide for a more efficient and functional traffic circulation system and will provide for more pleasing and more extensive greenbelt areas than could be achieved under the normal subdivision approach 5 the planning commission may at its discretion vary the thoroughfare frontage requirement and permit access to a local residential street when the cluster housing development is on property that abuts a multiplefamily or a nonresidential zoning district and that abutting property has frontage

use plan b there are however a limited number of uses and certain characteristics of land use that may warrant special consideration for placement within a particular zoning district that would otherwise prohibit them the particular characteristics of these uses are such that their influence on adjacent land use is a positive one or one that will not adversely impact adjacent land use  37071

stored onboard via a battery for motive purpose electric vehicle includes  a battery electric vehicle  and  a plugin hybrid electric vehicle b in order to proactively plan for and accommodate the anticipated future growth in market demand for electric vehicles it is strongly encouraged but not required that all new and expanded nonresidential development parking areas provide the electrical capacity necessary to accommodate the future hardwire installation of level2 electric vehicle charging stations it is recommended that a typical parking lot eg 1000 or fewer parking spaces have a minimum ratio of 2% of the total parking spaces be prepared for such stations the following definitions would have to be included if adopted level1 is considered slow charging voltage including the range from zero level2 is considered medium charging voltage is greater than 120 and includes 240 level3 is considered fast or rapid charging voltage is greater than 240 c it is noted and understood that largesized parking may require fewer electric vehicle charging stations than recommended above to accommodate the anticipated market demand  37075 roseville code  37075   37076 offstreet parking

violation of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by jail for a period not to exceed 93 days andor a fine of $500 wind turbine components a intent 1 the intent of the gratiot avenue corridor overlay zone is to improve traffic operations  reduce potential for crashes  improve pedestrian and transit environments  and preserve the vehicular carrying capacity of gratiot avenue on the number spacing placement and design of access points published reports and recommendations by the michigan department of transportation mdot show a relationship between the number of access points and the number of crashes 2 recognizing the existing built character and downtown land use characteristics in the city of roseville this chapter intends to apply the mdot access management standards where practical but to allow flexibility in their application given the unique needs of this more urbanized area development along gratiot avenue contains an interconnected grid street pattern and urban building form that  370112 roseville code  370113  is highly conducive to downtown activity this section intends to complement efforts to make gratiot avenue more walkable by improving the transit and nonmotorized environments by limiting the amount of direct access to gratiot avenue and thus the number of potential vehicletopedestrian crashes the segment of gratiot avenue within roseville is characterized by a median road design that naturally restricts turning movements to a single direction which present unique traffic operations  therefore this section places more emphasis on the design and spacing of driveways from signalized intersections and median crossovers b applicability this overlay zone shall apply to all land with frontage along gratiot avenue the following applications must also comply with the standards in this section 1 new or enlarged building or structure any new principal building or structure or the enlargement of any principal building or

fewest necessary to provide reasonable access to the site each lot shall be permitted one access point which may consist of an individual driveway a shared access with an adjacent use or access via a service drive 3 additional access points additional access points may be permitted by the planning commission upon finding that all other standards are met andor if a traffic impact study is submitted that justifies a need for additional access due to safety reasons or where a poor level of service will result from fewer access points 4 spacing and offset from intersections access points shall be either directly aligned or spacedoffset as far from intersections as practical especially signalized intersections a minimum spacing or offset of 150 feet is preferred 5 consideration of median crossovers access points along median sections of gratiot avenue shall be located in consideration of median crossovers the city supports mdot policies to limit the  370113 vehicles abandoned  370113  number of median crossovers to maintain traffic flow and reduce the potential for accidents access points shall directly align with or be offset a sufficient distance from median crossovers to allow for weaving across travel lanes and storage within the median a minimum offset of 250 feet is preferred 6 spacing of access points on same side of road access points shall provide the following spacing from other access points along the same side of the public street measured from center line to center line as shown on the figure based on the posted speed limit along the abutting road segment according to the following table or where full compliance cannot be achieved access shall be spaced as far apart as practical posted speed limit mph along gratiot avenue feet along other roads feet 35 or less 245 150 40 300 185 45 350 230 notes  unless greater spacing is required by mdot or required to meet other standards herein 7 consideration of adjacent sites where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future the access shall be located to ensure the adjacent sites can also meet the access location standards in the future  370113 roseville code  370113  8 shared driveways where direct access consistent with the above regulations cannot be achieved access should be provided via a shared driveway or service drive where implemented shared access or service driveways should be accompanied by an executed access agreement signed by all affected property owners 9 access design where practical given rightofway constraints access points shall be designed with radii tapers and other geometrics as determined by mdot that are required to minimize the impacts of inbound right turns on traffic flow d review procedure applications shall be processed according to site plan review and  370139 certificates of occupancy as appropriate the building official may require planning commission review as part of any zoning compliance certificate requests if it is determined that such request does not adhere to the standards of this section 1 submittal information along with any other required information developments subject to review shall submit a detailed information showing existing access points on adjacent sites  proposed access points  changes to existing access  and any information requested by the city that is needed to review site access b the planning commission may require submittal of a traffic impact report prepared by a qualified traffic engineer to verify the need for additional access points or to justify a modification c where it is determined that certain site plan submittal requirements are not necessary to the review and understanding of the site the planning commission may waive the site plan requirements and allow submittal of a scaled drawing that provides sufficient detail to review site access 2 modification of plan standards the planning commission may waive certain requirements of this section upon consideration of the following a the proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone and the recommendations of the gratiot avenue corridor improvement plan and published mdot guidelines b mdot staff endorse the proposed access design c driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on flow d the modification is for an access point that has or is expected to have very low traffic volumes less than 50 inbound and  370113 vehicles abandoned  370113   370114 conditional rezoning added 4122011 by
