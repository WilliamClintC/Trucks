be known and may be cited as the licensing of coinoperated amusement devices law of the city of ogdensburg new york  7112 policy  findings a it is hereby declared as the policy of the city of ogdensburg that it is necessary to regulate and control the operation of coinoperated amusement devices for the purpose of fostering and promoting the public order including but not limited to the public interests hereinafter set forth b the city council has been made aware of crowd congestion in and near establishments which have as their principal source of business the playing of coinoperated amusement devices including electronic and computerized game machines and the city council hereby determines that such crowded conditions tend to threaten the orderly conduct of business in such establishments as well as in other nearby businesses such crowded and noisy conditions also disturb persons passing by on the sidewalks as well as adjacent and nearby residences c further the city council determines that because of the number of persons who frequent establishments which have as their principal source of business the playing of such amusement devices it is in the interest of the public good to determine whether premises containing game rooms comply with all fire health sanitary and building codes and other applicable state and local laws and to adopt rules and regulations governing the occupancy and use of such game rooms the city council further determines that a particularly large segment of those playing the machines are teenagers some of whom patronize such establishments during school hours rather than attend required school classes and thereby undermine their health and welfare as well as place an unnecessary financial and social cost on the taxpayers of the city of ogdensburg d the city council thus declares that the abovestated policy will best be carried out by establishing the licensing procedure set forth in this article and that such licensing procedure is necessary and will enhance the publics health safety and order by reasonably providing safeguards for the community in the conduct of such businesses it is further determined that the hereinafter imposed license fee is reasonably related to the citys cost of implementing and enforcing the license requirements the city council determines that the concerns set forth above are increased as the number of devices in a location is increased the city council further determines that the concerns addressed by this legislation are likely to be magnified and increased as the number of amusement devices is increased in a particular location 71 5 amusement devices  7113 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings

treatment of said company warrants a reanalysis for the determination of a new pollutant concentration of its wastes discharged from such premises into the public sewer system the new pollutant concentration shall then be used in calculating new charges and shall become effective as of the date of the subsequent billing period 177 40 ogdensburg code c whenever the wastes discharged from a

may use as the figure representing the number of cubic feet andor gallons of sewage discharged into the sewer system the amount of water supplied to the premises by the city or if such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system made by the city engineer or the number of cubic feet of sewage discharged into the sewer system as determined by measurements and samples taken at a manhole installed by the owner of the property served by the public sewer system at his own expense

person must be present or represented during the resampling operation d resampling must be performed when all waste producing processes are contributing wastes of normal concentrations at their normal rate e the results of the resampling and the reanalysis in a laboratory designated by the city engineer shall be considered to be the current analysis of the wastes discharged to the public sewer

benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible for the application to pursue other than an area variance 3 whether the requested area variance is substantial 4 whether the
