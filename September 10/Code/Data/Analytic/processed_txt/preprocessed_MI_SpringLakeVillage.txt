hazard areas of the village are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative

to flooding  b flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the village and the region  c land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion increased sediment transport and deposition and increased nonpoint source pollutant loading to the receiving water bodies and the great lakes  d stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  e stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have increased as a result of land development and have impacted the water resources of the spring lake watershed  68editors note amended at time of

accomplish among others the following objectives to f stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution because of land development within the village have resulted in deterioration of the water resources of the village and downstream municipalities  g increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the village will absent proper regulation and control adversely affect the village water bodies and water resources and those of downstream municipalities  h stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development  i adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained in or cited by this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff  j adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public health safety and
