intent and purpose of this section to allow repair and replacement of decks walkways and steps but at the same time to minimize the intrusion of repair and replacement on public property d in any case where the general construction of the primary structure would prohibit the attachment of a cantilevered or diagonallybraced deck ie prefirm house not elevated on pilings or with concrete or block

hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article therefore the town of oak island establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of the state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge  purpose a general the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this article seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2 requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding and erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream or tidal creek temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels aquatic habitats and estuaries  3 establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establishing provisions for the longterm

impact upon health safety and welfare of the community more specifically 1 illicit stormwater discharges carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality and effect in closures of shell fishing waters 2 a nutrient such as phosphorus or nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna 3 improper connection to the storm drain system and to waters of the state adversely impacts quality of receiving waters 4 septic tank discharges from noncompliant systems washing machine discharges and illegal dumping into the stormwater drains are examples of illicit discharges 5 the town must have the authority to deter andor stop illicit discharges to stormwater drains and ditches 6 substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters 7 illicit discharges to water bodies diminish their capacity to naturally process runoff nutrients thereby harming flora and fauna 8 increase of illicit discharge to waters can percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater quality 9 improperly managed stormwater systems can decrease the quality of property and human life 10 improperly managed stormwater drainage systems can interfere with the maintenance of optimum estuarine areas and biological productivity 11 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with an illicit stormwater discharge ordinance  30 objectives the purpose of this article is to provide for the health safety and general welfare of the people of the town regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the storm

res of 7112000  12  3 basis for determination of surcharges a charges and fees shall be based upon a minimum basic charge for each premises computed on the basis of wastewater from a domestic premises with the following characteristics bod250 mgl total suspended solids250 mgl oil and grease40 mgl b the charges and fees for all classification of users other than the domestic premises shall be based on the relative difference between the average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as related to those of a domestic premises c the charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user which may include but not be limited to bod cod oil and grease chlorine demand and volume 12  4 method of determining surcharges the charges for excesses of the constituents listed in section 30144 will be based upon the mass emission rate of those constituents and determined thusly as follows 1 mass emission rate mer  equals mg by c by 834 where mer is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent and mg is the millions of gallons of wastewater discharged and c is the concentration of mgl of the particular constituent being charged for as an example bod cod etc and 834 is equal to the number of poundsone gallon of water 2 the amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated thusly as follows ao equals r by mer  where ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars and r is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent and mer  is equal to the pounds of a constituent an example of surcharge cannons corporation is a producer of canned fruits they discharged 1000000 gallons of wastewater in the month of january analysis found that the wastewater had the following characteristics bod equals mgl tss equals 950 mgl there were no other limitations exceeded in this example there were 100 employees employed at the cannery the limits of bod and tss are 250 mgl the mer of bod is equal to merbod   400250 by 834 by 1 mg   150 by 834 by 1   1121 pounds of bod or  thousand pounds bod if the charge for bod is r equals $45001000 pounds bod then the total charge for bod is equal to as ao   r by mer ao   $4500 by  ao   $5045 for tss the charge would be computed thusly mertss  950250 by 834 by 1mg equals 700 by 834 by 1 equals 5838 pounds tss or  thousand pounds tss at a charge of $4500thousand pounds the charge for tss equals  by $4500 equals $26271 total surcharge for january equals $5045 + $26271 equals $31316 12  5 method of determining charge rates and user charge and billing procedure a the town council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the towns wastewater treatment plants and collection system plus the cost to obtain wastewater treatment from other entities and adjust the surcharge rates the administrative minimum charge if any and the volume user rate per 1000 gallons to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment the adjustments if any will become effective at such time that a new published rate schedule is approved by council the council may review these rates andor minimum charges and adjust them accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the town all current sewer related rates charges fees deposit amounts etc that would be applicable per section 30143 shall be provided in an established rate schedule as approved and amended by the town council from time to time b each consumer shall be responsible for paying the current monthly availability fee if one is established an availability fee may be established to ensure sufficient revenue to fund the operation and maintenance of the towns water system wastewater collection and treatment systems and any minimum base costs that may be associated with obtaining wastewater treatment from other agencies if established in no instance will such availability fee be made exception to in the case of multifamily structures mixeduse structures strip malls or shopping centers being serviced by a single meter an availability fee shall be charged for each consumerunit contained in the building c the billing procedure for sewer user charges shall be the same as for water charges with the bills for sewer figured in accordance with the towns current published rate schedule for sewer users including any penalties or service charges as may be applicable 12  6   sampling procedures and analysis a all samples and determinations of wastewater characteristics shall be as representative of the waste discharge as possible the costs of regular sampling and analysis will be included in the charges and fees the town may take additional samples after a significant process change that significantly affects the quantity of strength of the wastewaters discharged the frequency of sampling shall be as follows yearly cumulative flow million gallons minimum required frequency of tests for surcharge parameters less than 10 01 per year 10 to 30 2 per year over 30 4 per year more frequent sampling may be done at any time at the option of the town b upon requests by the person concerned the town shall make available split samples of the composite sample collected if the person feels the results are not representative of his wastes the town may resample at a cost to the person of $10000 per day which will include sampling and analysis for bod tss cod ph chlorine demand oil grease and heavy metals if necessary 12  7 secs

contained in this  nonconforming uses a nonconforming use is a use of land buildings or structures that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this udo or any amendment thereto but which does not conform to the regulations for the zoning classification in which it is located nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter  expansions no nonconforming use shall be extended expanded enlarged or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land buildings or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming  provided however a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming  no building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged extended reconstructed moved or structurally altered unless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use  provided however such building or structure may be enlarged or extended upon the granting of a variance from the board of adjustment which variance shall not be granted unless the board of adjustment makes each of the following findings of fact in addition to the findings included in 1 the proposed enlargement or extension shall be less than ten percent of the building or structure gross enclosed floor area in relation to the existing building or structure 2 the proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use which is to say it will not result in an increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use 3 the proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible that it is in its existing circumstances 4 the authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension does not harm or reduce the public health safety or welfare  where a nonconforming use ceases for 365 consecutive days then the use shall not be reestablished or resumed and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of this udo vacancy and nonuse of the building or structure regardless of the intent of the owner shall constitute discontinuance under this provision  when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this udo is vacated or discontinued the 365day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the day the property is vacated or the use discontinued  where a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent of 75 percent or more of its current appraised valuation as determined by the current brunswick county real property tax assessment such building or structure if restored shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses  repair maintenance and reconstruction  minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than 75 percent of the appraised valuation as determined by the current county real property tax assessment of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section  if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would not exceed 75 percent of the brunswick county tax value or the appraised valuation by a north carolina licensed appraiser of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection 93  the udo administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 no violation of will occur  and 2 the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this udo permit conditions applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use  residential structures removed from a vzone due to firm map revisions that are damaged greater than as described in may be restored to their original footprint and height but may not be enlarged or expanded and must meet all other local state and federal regulations  multifamily structures damaged as described in may be restored to their original footprint and density but may not be enlarged or expanded multifamily structures completely destroyed may be rebuilt to their original footprint and density but may not be expanded or enlarged  change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists  a change in the use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or special use permit under this udo may not be made except in accordance with subsection  the other requirements of this this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed  if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status  if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permitted in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the board of adjustment issues a variance authorizing the change in accordance with this permit may be issued if the board of adjustment finds in addition to any other permits that may be required by this that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of   and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this not reasonably possible if among other reasons compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot unless under common ownership where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible however the udo administrator may conclude that compliance is not reasonably possible if the cost financial and otherwise of compliance is substantially disproportional to the benefits of eliminating nonconformity in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created  if the intended change in principal nonconforming use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming in the district where the property is located then the change in nonconforming use is permissible if the board of adjustment issues a permit authorizing the change the board of adjustment may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning or special use permit  and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection  of this section are satisfied  and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it except for the applicant and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for an existing nonconforming use shall be discontinued within 60 days of the date of approval of a change in nonconforming use subsequent to that time such existing use shall become unlawful  abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations  if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 365 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations the zoning permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected  for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter  when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this the 365day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this 7  completion of nonconforming projects  all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 365 days before the effective date of this well as all nonconforming projects that are at least 25 percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction  except as provided in subsection  and except to the extent that a developer has a vested right as set forth in all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked unless the developer requests an appeal to the board of adjustment to overturn the udo administrators decision an appeal shall stay any revocation the udo administrator shall issue such a permit if heshe finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the it existed before the effective date of this thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the udo administrator shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building zoning sign or special or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective 2 except as provided in subdivision 1 no expenditures made more than 365 days before the effective date of this be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if the person i had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the the proposed development site which could not be attributed to him or ii should have known of the proposed change in the even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the udo administrator may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the requirements of the proposed udo administrator may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to avoid requirements of the proposed heshe determines that i at the time the expenditures were made it was not clear that the proposed prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures 7 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the udo administrator shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the udo administrator may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the the project nonconforming the udo administrator shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that nonconforming project  when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection  and obtain permits in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 1 the udo administrator shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but incompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations 4 the udo administrator shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection  that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this udo administrator may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year  authorization of nonconforming projects whenever an amendment to this effective after an application for a development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued and the effect of the amendment is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect then the applicant may choose to proceed with the development under the previous requirements or under the amended requirements  nonconforming signs  subject to the remaining restrictions of this section nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued  no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign without limiting the generality of the foregoing no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition  nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign  a nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this article  if a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes it may not thereafter be repaired reconstructed or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land for purposes of this section a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value tax value if listed for tax purposes of the sign damaged  the message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformity for example by creating an offpremises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed  subject to other provisions of this section nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12month period 75 percent of the value tax value if listed for tax purposes of such sign or appraised tax value of a replacement  any sign that does not conform with the regulations set forth in section  shall be brought into conformance with section  within six months after the date of the notice of nonconformity   amend of 111220191 article 10

sections 10711074  reserved for future use part vii  flood damage prevention regulationscoastal regular phase division i  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the town council of oak island north carolina does ordain as follows  findings of fact  the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of oak island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare  these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards  statement of purpose it is the purpose of flood damage prevention regulations to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to  restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities   require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction   control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters   control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and  prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  objectives the objectives of flood damage prevention regulations are to  protect human life safety and health   minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects   minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public   minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions   minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas   help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and  ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area  division ii  general provisions lands to
