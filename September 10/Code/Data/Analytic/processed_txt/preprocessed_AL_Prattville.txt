alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  3 these impacts may be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites  and 4 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the alabama department of environmental management promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the city of prattville to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article   purpose a general  the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and post construction stormwater runoff can safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific  this article seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establish standards for development and redevelopment that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the preconstruction hydrologic response in their post construction state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storms in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion point and nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum post construction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural bmps that may be used to meet the minimum post construction stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of low impact site design practices such as the use of vegetated stormwater conveyances and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of the stormwater management systems to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety or public health  7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review and approval of stormwater management systems for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance  8 assign responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention   applicability and jurisdiction a general  beginning with and subsequent to its effective date this article shall be
