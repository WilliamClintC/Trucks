states congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate personal wireless telecommunication systems it is the further purpose and intent of the village of riverside to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of residential neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in particular these standards attempt to address issues of demand visual mitigation engineering residual impacts and facility design so as to minimize to the extent possible the amount of aesthetic degradation property devaluation and safety implications related to the siting of such facilities in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section an attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate personal wireless telecommunication services and facilities it is the further purpose and intent of this section to a promote the public health safety and welfare b facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for personal wireless telecommunication facilities c ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings d limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impacts upon existing infrastructure systems and other public services and facility needs e allow the village board to regulate and restrict personal wireless telecommunications facilities and services as special uses f allow the village board to permit personal wireless telecommunication facilities as special uses at site locations on a priority basis subject to applicable standards and conditions g recognize that operation of a personal wireless telecommunication system may in the opinion of the applicant require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the higher priority areas in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods within the community consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities h provide for adequate information about plans for personal wireless telecommunications

designed for compatibility including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section k the village board finds that the presence of numerous tower structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare 2 permitted locations a special uses in all circumstances a new personal wireless
