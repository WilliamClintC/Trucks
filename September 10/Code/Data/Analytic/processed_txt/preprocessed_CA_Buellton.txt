neurological system thereby leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections certain cancers and neurological diseases d a person afflicted with aidshiv infection can suffer a variety of bacterial viral andor fungal caused illnesses cancers protozoan and neurological conditions which debilitate the body resulting in a high mortality rate within several years after diagnosis e the transmission of the virus has occurred of body fluids for example blood blood byproducts body organs and semen body fluids can be transferred sexual contact sharing of hypodermic needles used in drug injections and to a fetus andor newborn infant from the mother f no evidence exists to indicate the spread of the virus contact such as contact at work or at school air or water or handling of food by persons having the aids virus g medical studies of family groups in which one or more persons having been diagnosed with aidshiv infection show no spread of the virus except exchange of body fluid such as intimacy s milk or exchange of blood such as mother to fetus h a public health danger represented by the hiv virus and its subsequent manifestation as aids is caused by the lengthy incubation

are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage and the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restriction or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other

procedure a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 the city council of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for exceptions from the requirements of this chapter 2 the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement of administration of this chapter 3 in passing upon such applications the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city  e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 4 generally exceptions may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items b3a b3k of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the exception increases 5 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b3 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of exceptions as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any exceptions to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency upon request 7 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and b such construction below base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance  1993  prior code   construction and demolition materials  title the regulations contained in this

utilizing the assumptions above where a singlefamily project includes a combination of dwelling sizes the maximum number of dwellings that may be permitted in a single project is computed as follows a for studio units seven units per gross acre divided by a factor of 100 times two gross acres times zero percent equals zero units b for one bedroom units seven units per gross acre divided by a factor
