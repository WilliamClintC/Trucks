12511   1291 purpose the village of larchmont is primarily a residential community the village board considers the maintenance of the quiet enjoyment of the residential areas of the village to be among its most important responsibilities the board has received a continuous series of complaints in recent years which it finds to be justified from homeowners in residential districts located near retail business districts of the village regarding noise both from persons and automobiles vandalism and excessive traffic flow during the early morning hours all emanating from retail business districts of the village in weighing the extreme irritation inconvenience and diminution of property values which homeowners and their families have experienced and are experiencing as a result of early morning retail business operations against the relatively minor inconvenience that would be caused to retail business establishments if they were required to close to the public for a few hours in the early morning and considering that the desire of retail business establishments to earn some minor additional profit by staying open beyond normal business hours is outweighed by the right of citizens in the residential area to the quiet enjoyment of their homes particularly during the early morning hours the village board has determined to enact this chapter in the best interests of the community as a whole  1292 hours of operation no retail business in the village of larchmont as defined in the village of larchmont zoning law11 which is located on a lot that is within 500 feet of

eventually discharging into the long island sound it is critically important that the village maintain repair improve and replace when necessary components of its sanitary sewer collection system in order to reduce extraneous flows and illegal discharges into its collection system before such flows enter the county trunk lines a major component of the extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer collection system is inflow and infiltration from groundwaters and poorly functioning storm drainage pipes municipalities must by law take action to fix and maintain sanitary sewer collection systems and storm drains to reduce all nonsanitary flows into the sanitary sewer system as the additional volumes adversely impact the trunk lines and the ability to treat waste at treatment plants b the

health and safety under p3b of the clean water act municipal separate stormwater sewer systems ms4 are required to reduce pollutants in stormwater systems to the maximum extent practicable to regulate such stormwater systems the environmental protection agency epa is authorized to enforce the clean water act and to encourage municipalities to reduce harmful pollutants going into the stormwater system m of the clean water act sets forth guidelines which deal with discharges and pollutants the village of larchmont which manages an ms4 must adhere to a set of six minimum measures in the administration of its stormwater system one of those minimum measures is maintaining the separation of stormwater and sanitary sewer systems to prevent inflow between the two systems c of the westchester county mandates that municipalities take immediate action to reduce extraneous flows of water due to infiltration illegal inflow and illegal stormwater connections to tributary sanitary

 25129 adjustment of  458 exemption if the total assessed value of the real property for which an exemption pursuant to  458 has been granted increases or decreases as the result of a revaluation or update of assessments and a material change in level of assessment as provided in title 2 of of a of the consolidated laws of the state of new york is certified for the assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the commissioner of taxation and finance the assessor shall increase or decrease the amount of such exemption by multiplying the amount of such exemption by the change in level of assessment factor a of the new york real property tax law  458 affords certain veterans of military service described in  458 or certain members of their families described in  458 who own real property as described in  458 a limited exemption from real estate taxes based upon what the statute calls eligible funds under  458 the maximum amount of the partial exemption is $7500 since properties in the village currently are assessed at only a fraction of their actual value a maximum of $7500 affords a veteran a reasonable exemption however since the village board anticipates that the assessments of real property in the village will be revalued to reflect their full value in time for the promulgation of the 2018 tentative tax assessment roll the exemption allowed by  458 will be significantly diminished if the maximum amount of the exemption remains fixed at $7500 b subdivision 5 of  458 authorizes the village board by local law to adjust the maximum amount of the partial exemption which  458 allows to reflect revaluation thereby continuing to make the exemption produce a reasonable reduction in real estate taxes for those persons entitled to it through this enactment the village board exercises the right given to it by subdivision 5 of  458  25128 solid waste  25129  taxicabs general references licenses and fees  see ch 185 vehicles and traffic  see ch 273 scofflaw vehicles  see ch

provisions  exemptions a findings of fact it is hereby determined that 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  and 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development b purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the village of larchmont and to address the findings of fact in  environmental quality review  33523  of this section this article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives amended 1242011 by ll no 12011 1 meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the nys

party  any person corporation partnership firm or other entity except the village of larchmont and its various boards commissions committees departments and agencies a recent court decisions have brought to the village boards attention the fact that certain types of physical displays are deemed to be symbolic speech and as such are entitled to the same constitutional protections and safeguards and subject to the same types of regulation as verbal speech b physical displays have characteristics which obviously make them different in some respects from verbal speech for example they are generally more permanent than a person or group of people who speak and then move on their size can be almost limitless if not constructed and erected properly they can be dangerous they can attract vandals and particularly if placed in parks children one cannot tell who is responsible for their placement and removal without a mechanism for responsible persons to identify themselves c being aware that certain physical displays on public property are entitled to the same protections as verbal speech and also being aware that physical displays are different from verbal speech in some respects the village board believes that it is in the best interest of the village to have a stated set of rules regarding such displays which can be applied evenhandedly which will encourage and provide for dissemination of ideas on public property in a manner consistent with the other uses made of the property and which will maximize the public health safety and welfare d the village board heretofore

facilities 1 findings  purposes  intent a findings and purposes the village finds that one of the principal assets of the village is its attractive lowrise onefamily residential character  that wireless telecommunications facilities are generally unsightly cause visual blight and if not sited in appropriate locations could seriously damage the aesthetic character of the village  that the existence of wireless telecommunications facilities within the village without proper safeguards to protect the aesthetic character of the community would be counter to the villages comprehensive plan  that after consultation with the village engineer and consideration of the fact that the village is only approximately one square mile in size the most appropriate areas for the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities are existing sites or village property where communications facilities can be most adequately hidden from view  and that it is unnecessary and would be adverse to the aesthetic character of the community to allow wireless telecommunications facilities within onefamily residence districts b it is the intent of the village to protect and promote the health safety and general welfare of its residents by establishing an orderly process for regulating the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities therefore a primary purpose of this section is to establish standards to minimize the adverse visual impact of wireless telecommunications facilities site placement design and height limitation in order to preserve the aesthetic character of the village and to maintain  38155 waterfront revitalization  38155  property values  to establish standards for the safe provision of wireless telecommunications services consistent with applicable state and federal law  and to encourage the shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities where appropriate the potential locations for facilities within the town of mamaroneck antenna zone are particularly appropriate because these locations contain or are near sites containing existing facilities where new facilities might be collocated or with which new facilities will visually blend the two potential villageowned sites village hall and the public works yard present unique opportunities to site the facilities because while they are in or adjacent to residential areas the existing improvements can be used to screen the antennas from their residential neighbors it is for these reasons and not revenue generation that this section gives preference to these locations 2 except as otherwise provided herein no wireless telecommunications antenna hereinafter antenna or antennas support structure or equipment facility shall hereafter be used erected changed or altered unless a special permit is obtained from the zoning board of appeals in conformity with this chapter 3 location requirements any application for the installation of an antenna support structure or equipment facility shall

a building support structure andor equipment facility where one or more antennas are already lawfully located for one or more of the following reasons a the absence of existing installations in the area requiring service  b the antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved support structure or building as documented by a qualified professional engineer and the existing or approved support structure cannot be reinforced modified or replaced to accommodate the planned or equivalent antenna at a reasonable cost  c the antenna would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned antennas at the support structure or building as documented by a qualified professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost  andor d make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use based on generally accepted accounting principles the charge may include but is not limited to a pro rata share of the
