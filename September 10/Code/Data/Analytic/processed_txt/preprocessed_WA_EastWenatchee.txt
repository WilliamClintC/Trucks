bridge design construction and reconstruction in establishing the minimum standards for development the city engineer has sought to encourage standardization and internationality of street design elements considerations include safety convenience aesthetics proper drainage and maintenance bthe citys permitting certification or licensing activities require the adoption of standards to guide individuals and entities in the administrative process of procuring the necessary city approvals the city must also have flexibility to carry out its general duty to provide streets streets and highways for the diverse and changing needs of the traveling public accordingly these standards are not intended to represent the legal standard by which the citys duty to the traveling public is to be measured cthe decision to use a particular street design element at a particular location should be made on the basis of an engineering analysis of the location thus while this document provides minimum requirements for design it is not a substitute for professional engineering judgment it is the intent that the provisions of these standards be international requirements for street and bridge design but may not be appropriate for all locations and existing situations dthese standards cannot provide for all situations it is intended to assist but not substitute for competent work by design professionals it is expected that each professional bring to each project the best of their skills and abilities these standards are also not intended to unreasonably limit any innovative or creative effort which could result in the more effective and appropriate combination of design cost savings or both any proposed departure from these standards will be judged on the likelihood that such a departure or variance will produce a compensating or comparable result adequate in every way for the street user and city resident exh b 2010  scope and applicability aexcept as exempted in ewmc  all

most cases the following will govern what city street standards will apply 1urban an urban location is defined as that area within a federally designated urban or urbanized area or a designated urban growth area as established by douglas county under the growth management act appropriate maps showing the boundaries are available from the city of east wenatchee bfunction 1city streets city streets

completion of the construction to city standards acceptance of the completed construction by the city engineer and approval of the final plat or other instrument as appropriate by the city all others must be put on the city street system by means of the street establishment process as specified in rcw and be constructed to city standards for public streets 2private streets private streets are all streets not designated as public streets and not open to general public travel cfunctional classification  general 1urban classification all city streets in urban areas are classified as urban local access urban collector urban minor arterial or urban principal arterial new streets and any modifications to existing connector or frontage streets that may be required as a condition of development approval shall meet the minimum design requirements for urban streets as specified in these standards appropriate maps showing the functional classifications are available from the city of east wenatchee dfunctional classification  descriptions 1principal arterial principal arterials permit traffic flow between cities and towns and between major elements of the urban areas they are of great importance in the regional transportation system as they interconnect major traffic generators such as central business districts and regional shopping centers to other major activity centers and carry a high proportion of the total area travel on a minimum of street mileage principal arterials frequently carry important intraurban as well as intercity bus routes many principal arterials are fully or partially access controlled facilities emphasizing the of traffic within the category are a interstates b other freeways and expressways and c other principal arterials spacing of principal arterials may vary from less than one mile in highly developed central business areas to five miles or more in sparsely developed urban fringes principal arterials generally comprise five to 10 percent of the urban system 2minor arterial minor arterials collect and distribute traffic from principal arterials to lesserclassified streets or allow for traffic to directly access their destination in urban areas they serve secondary traffic generators such as community business centers neighborhood shopping centers multiple residence areas and traffic from neighborhood to neighborhood within a community urban bus routes generally follow these facilities access to land use activities is generally prohibited such facilities are usually spaced under two miles apart in urban fringes and in core areas can be spaced oneeighth to onehalf mile apart 3collectors urban collectors provide for land access and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas they distribute traffic movements from such areas to the arterial system halfmile spacing is common in more developed areas collectors do not handle long are not continuous for any great length they generally account for five to 10 percent of the total street system 4local access streets all public streets not otherwise classified as an arterial or collector comprise the local access system these streets primarily serve local needs for access to adjacent lands travel over relatively short distances and connections to collectors or other higher systems local urban streets offer the lowest level of mobility and usually contain no bus routes service to movement is deliberately discouraged local streets usually account for 65 to 80 percent of the urban system eterrain terrain is a basis for further classification of geometric requirements 1flat terrain is that condition where street sight distances as governed by both horizontal and vertical restrictions are generally long or could be made to be so without construction difficulty or major expense the slope of the existing terrain is from zero percent to and including five percent 2rolling terrain is that condition where the natural slopes rise above and fall below the street grade line consistently normal street alignment is restricted by occasional steep slopes the slope of the existing terrain is from five percent to and including 15 percent 3mountainous terrain is that condition where longitudinal and transverse changes in the elevation of the ground with respect to a street are abrupt and where the roadbed is obtained by frequent benching or side hill excavation the slope of the existing terrain exceeds 15 percent terrain classification pertains to the general character of the specific route corridor streets in valleys or passes of mountainous areas that have all the characteristics of streets traversing flat or rolling terrain should be classified as flat or rolling in rolling terrain trucks reduce their speeds below those of passenger cars on some sections of street mountainous terrain is responsible for some truck operation at crawl speeds in cases where the terrain classification is in question the city engineer shall make the final decision exh b 2010 design criteria for streets scope general requirements general design principles for new streets design requirements  new and reconstructed streets storm water management new utilities connections to existing utilities  scope the purpose of this chapter is to present criteria for the design of streets it is to be used by developers and their engineers in the design of public and private streets for which approval by the city engineer is required exh b 2010  general requirements aminimum standards the provisions stipulated in this section are required minimum standards and shall be considered applicable to all parts of these specifications including any supplements and revisions all construction within the public rightofway shall be designed by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the state of washington all drawings and support data submitted to the city for approval must bear hisher seal the signature of the registered professional engineer will only be required on the approved final plans the design criteria as presented are intended to aid in preparation of plans and specifications and include minimum standards where applicable these design criteria are considered minimum and a complete design will usually require more than is presented in this document as with any design criteria occasions may arise where the minimum standards are either inappropriate or cannot be justified economically and an equal but alternative solution may be proposed a written request for each alternative shall be directed to the city engineer and shall conform to criteria in ewmc  alternatives bapplication to private streets although community street requirements are usually best served by public streets owned and maintained by the city private streets may be appropriate for some local access streets for either residential or commercialindustrial property these standards apply to private streets as part of the citys responsibility to ensure adequate access for normal and emergency vehicle use to individual parcels throughout the city private streets are permitted only when all of the following conditions are met 1permanently established by tract or easement providing legal access to each affected lot dwelling unit or business and sufficient to accommodate required improvements to include provision for future use by adjacent property owners when applicable 2constructed to east wenatchee street standards as set forth herein 3accessible at all times for emergency and public service vehicle use 4not obstructing or part of the present or future public neighborhood circulation or arterial plan developed in processes such as the greater east wenatchee area comprehensive plan or capital improvement plan 5designed for an average daily traffic count aadt of 160 or less vehicles per day utilizing current ite guidelines new private streets directly accessing a city street that will generate more than 160 aadt will be permitted only by approval of the hearing examiner and will be required to meet the appropriate city street standards contained herein see figures 37a  there is no maximum aadt provision if a new development is served by an extension of or spur off an existing private street  however should such existing private street be less than the standards considering the current and proposed aadt the new development may be denied unless a lower level of improvement has been approved by the city hearing examiner upon recommendation by the city engineer or the applicant assumes responsibility for bringing the existing private street serving the new development up to these standards 6maintained in accordance with these standards by a capable and legally responsible owner homeowners association or other legal entity made up of all benefited property owners a written street maintenance agreement addressing the rights and responsibilities of all benefited property owners shall be approved by the city prior to final approval of the land development said street maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the city and shall become a covenant with the affected properties the term benefited property owners shall include the owners of record of all properties with frontage including access rights on the private street or otherwise have legal access whether constructed or not to the private street 7clearly described as a private street not maintained by the city on the face of the plat short plat or other development authorization 8clearly signed at the street location as a private street exh b 2010  general design principles for new streets astreet network circulation the importance of good street network circulation for the health welfare and safety of the public cannot be overemphasized poor circulation adds unnecessary miles to pedestrian and trail systems school bus routes mail delivery and other service deliveries utility services and most importantly emergency services such as police and fire through good street network circulation the public will have better emergency access and police and fire safety will be enhanced 1plans will be reviewed for the provision of the best possible street and pedestrian network circulation and for conformance with any adopted comprehensive plan the street alignment may necessitate realignment in order to foster the longrange transportation objectives of the city this includes greater scrutiny to provide continuity of pedestrian and other trail systems related to the proposed street network the inclusion of permanent culdesacs is strongly discouraged as they inhibit street and pedestrian network circulation see ewmc l for specific requirements and are not consistent with the city comprehensive plan 2to facilitate the best possible street and pedestrian network circulation if it is determined by the city engineer after making an individualized determination that the layout of streets is to provide for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining subdivisions then the streets shall be constructed prior to final plat approval when adjoining property is not subdivided the city engineer shall determine whether streets in the proposed plat are to provide access to such unplatted property the location for access to unplatted property shall be placed such that the objectives in these standards can be achieved reserve easement strips may be required to prevent unauthorized access until such time as the connecting streets are constructed 3if the streets are to remain private the above still applies except a separate tract or easement will be shown on the final plat map and they will not be dedicated to the public specific information in the recorded covenants regarding the use of this easement will be required 4unless otherwise approved all lots within major subdivisions shall be accessed by means of an internal street network this network may be public or private but not a mixture of both access easements or multidwelling driveways in lieu of public or private streets shall not be permitted bonsite principles an integral part of an overall traffic study relates to basic site planning principles an integrated onsite street system should deliver vehicles from the external street system in a manner easily understood by typical drivers and that maximizes efficiency accommodates anticipated traffic patterns and ensures public safety 1alignment connecting street centerlines deflecting from each other more than 10 degrees shall be connected by a curve the radius of which shall be approved by the city engineer street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is practicable and street jogs having offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided 2internal vehicular circulation internal circulation is the means by which vehicular traffic is delivered between entry points and parking areas pickupdropoff points and service areas and should be planned to accommodate appropriate future traffic volumes 3subdivision boundary streets a street lying along the boundary of a subdivision may be dedicated with less than the width required by these standards if it is practicable to require the dedication of the remaining portion of such width when the adjoining property is subdivided in such case there is required a reserve easement strip one foot wide along such street for the purpose of withholding access to the unsubdivided property from such street until a street is constructed to the full width required the procedure shall also apply in the case of any street that deadends at the boundary of a subdivision 4access points streets and lots shall be laid out to provide individual lot access onto an internal street system hence via the internal street system to the existing public street system direct access to a perimeter street shall normally be denied except for direct access onto a designated local access street 5parking parking shall be provided to meet sitegenerated demands and be consistent with ewmc title 17 and other planning department policies 6vehicular queuing and storage aaccess drives should provide adequate vehicular exit queuing bparking areas and access points of small developments should be designed so vehicles waiting to exit are aligned perpendicular to the offsite street system cqueuing areas of large developments should be sufficient so vehicles queued at exits do not block internal circulation exits shall be signalized if warranted by the mutcd at build out ddocumentation shall be provided to verify queue lengths for signalized intersections onsite queuing reservoirs and offsite left and rightturn lanes 7building service drives building service drives are streets adjacent to a building and its entrances and should be designed with sufficient width to serve as one or all of the following afire andor emergency vehicle access bpedestrian pickupdropoff points pedestrian crossings and pickupdropoff points should be signed and striped to identify the vehicularpedestrian conflict cinternal circulation drecirculation in parking areas recirculation aisles shall have sufficient turning radii clearances sight distances and signing etransit passenger pickupdrop off areas 8pedestrian bus bicycle and disabled access facilities the overall site plans must consider pedestrians bus bicycle and disabled access facilities apedestrian facilities pedestrian connections between public transportation facilities and site buildings shall be integrated into the overall project design pedestrian facilities shall be designed to reduce the motor vehicle use for trips within the development and between nearby developments btransit facilities appropriate public transportation facilities such as passenger shelters ride sharing areas and bus staging areas shall be accommodated adjacent to service drive and entrance areas  at key locations along circulation drives  and at major pedestrian focal points along the external street system as determined by the city and link transit cbicycle facilities facilities for parking bicycles should be provided where bicycle use is expected refer to ewmc  ddisabled access facilities access for disabled persons shall be provided in accordance with federal state and city requirements 9service and delivery vehicles service and delivery vehicles require separate criteria for movement to and from the site avehicle turning paths shall be sufficient to accommodate the largest vehicles anticipated a minimum single unit truck su bservice vehicle access points shall have turning paths sufficient to allow service vehicles to enter and exit the site without encroaching upon opposing lanes or curbed areas cexternal and internal streets shall have sufficient separation for large vehicles to be queued on entry or exit without blocking access to parking spaces or internal streets cfitting the street into the environment when land development requires the construction of new streets there are opportunities to fit the street into the existing landscape and environment in ways that are more pleasing to the eye than just simple straight lines the principles set forth in this section stress the importance of protecting conserving and enhancing the scenic qualities of a city street they are also consistent with good engineering and the necessity to provide a street which is safe to travel and economical to construct and maintain unless conditioned by shall these principles are not regulatory but are advisory only to provide guidance to developers 1relating alignment to the landscape a unique visual quality of most city streets is the harmonious relationship their alignments have with the landscape increased volumes of traffic poor sight distance or other operational conditions may often necessitate modification of an existing alignment if such a change is necessary the street geometry usually must become more precise and directional however a new alignment should not be considered a straight line connecting two points rather it should seek the same qualities of existing alignments by reinforcing and revealing the features of the landscape the following guidelines will be useful for relating new alignments with the landscape achoose an alignment that blends with the terrain and adjusts to important scenic features bin most instances the appropriate alignment will be characterized by curves that continually adjust to the rolling topography of natural landform a curvilinear alignment is visually and functionally preferable to long tangents that cut leaving steep unsightly and unstable embankments cwhere the land is level or a strong lineal direction is created by landscape elements such as a long row of trees or the patterns of fields the use of a long tangent may be justified when using a long tangent try to direct it toward a natural or manmade focal point dwhen climbing a hillside the street should bend to the crest traversing the contours rather than climbing it straight on however care must be taken to avoid hiding a curve or driveway just beyond the brow of a hill ewhen crossing a ridge pick a saddle or low area in the top to locate the street fnatural and manmade features provide variety and contrast which maintain the travelers interest whenever possible alignments should be located to bring the more interesting features into view gnear the edges of surface water woods or a break in topography use alignments that echo or emphasize the shape of the edges however avoid moving streets close to the waters edge as it destroys habitat hwhen approaching important features it is preferable to allow a distant view of the object curve the alignment away and then bring it close for a contrasting view a street which blends with the form and pattern of the landscape is also desirable from the standpoint of construction and maintenance some of the advantages to be gained are reduction of cut and fill quantities more efficient utilization of natural drainage and better control of roadside erosion because natural vegetation is preserved 2combining horizontal and vertical alignment the combination of horizontal and vertical alignments closely influences the appearance and safety of a street when alignments are properly coordinated a street will be visually pleasing and safer to travel alignment coordination primarily applies to major streets but the basic principles should also be recognized as important considerations when altering minor streets set forth below is a partial list of suggestions to guide the combination of horizontal and vertical alignments aconsistency in the scale of horizontal and vertical elements should be maintained whenever possible small dips and humps should be avoided in what is actually a uniform grade and kinks should be avoided in what is actually a long curve bthe beginning and ending of horizontal and vertical alignments should not occur in the same location the beginning of a horizontal curve should generally occur before beginning a vertical curve and be somewhat longer in length this provides a gradual transition between the alignments and prevents one from accentuating the other cthe beginning of a horizontal curve should not coincide with the top of a hill this situation is visually deceptive and hazardous as the quick change in horizontal alignment cannot be seen by the driver davoid dips in vertical alignment before beginning a horizontal curve this will prevent the street from appearing disjointed eavoid broken back curves two horizontal curves in the same direction with a short tangent inbetween compound curves or reverse curves except for local access streets with a design speed of 25 mph fwhen an extremely long grade is necessary it may be better to adjust the vertical alignment so the grade is steeper near the bottom of the hill and gradually lessens as it approaches the crest of the hill another alternative is to create an alignment with intervals of lesser grades gsight distance requirements vary with the anticipated speed of vehicles adequate sight distance must be provided this should be checked at all horizontal curves and crest vertical curves 3crosssmall scale of crosssection elements is an important characteristic adding to the scenic quality of a city street this aspect is most apparent in the width of the traveling surface its adjacent shoulders and the close proximity of the roadside where traffic volumes are low speeds are slow and meeting and passing of vehicles is infrequent a narrow crosssection may be appropriate modifications which require widening of the street will alter the existing scale of the city street and consequently its visual impact on the motorist and adjacent properties the following considerations should guide the determination of an appropriate crosssection aappropriate widths should be determined by the function the street serves as part of the city street system operational requirements for safe vehicular movement and the characteristics of topography and other physical features check results of planning considerations in most cases the minimum crosssection based on location functional class and traffic volume is shown in figures 37a in ewmc  bconsider all elements of the crosssection traveling surface shoulders ditches proper grading to stabilize cut and fill slopes slope rounding etc 4roadside slopes proper molding of roadside slopes is essential during the grading operation slopes which do provide a smooth visual transition from the street to existing land forms have a pleasing appearance slopes shaped in this manner are also required for effective erosion control adequate drainage and reduced maintenance some general guidelines to follow when grading the roadside are set forth below awhere the topography is flat to rolling and the landscape is open slopes which are flattened and wellrounded are appropriate flattening of slopes to  four horizontal to one vertical should be carried out bwhere the topography is steep uneven and wooded roadside slopes with grades of  or  should be favored to save roadside vegetation however check to make sure the slope is flat enough to be stable cvary the steepness of roadside slopes to save vegetation and other landscape features don areas of extreme cut which may require easements or more rightofway the use of small benches stepped down a steep slope will slow water runoff and provide excellent locations where vegetation can quickly take hold it is important to maintain a slight downhill pitch on these benches to provide adequate drainage eon fill slopes of extreme length larger benches can be formed to fulfill the same functions as above fall slopes should be wellrounded to form a smooth transition from the shoulder edge to the existing grades deep ditches with welldefined bottoms are required where drainage or soils are poor rounded or shallow ditches are acceptable when there is little drainage and the soil is free draining gall slopes should be warped by flattening the ends of cut and fill areas this will avoid sharp breaks between new and existing grades and result in natural looking slopes that will more effectively support vegetation hwhen grading the street avoid disturbing important roadside vegetation and the creation of deep cuts that expose tree roots and leave steep banks that are susceptible to erosion and difficult to maintain 5ditches ditches provide an important function in sustaining quality streets by providing adequate storm and subgrade groundwater drainage excessively deep or wide ditches can severely impact vegetation and the feel of a street or safety several issues to consider when selecting a ditch section follows aslopes from the street to the ditch bottom shall be at least  or greater the shallower pitches will allow for some vehicle recovery and less potential of a vehicle overturning on higher speed streets bditches must be deeper than the subgrade to allow drainage of street base and surfacing courses cwhere ditch construction may impact significant roadside features short sections of culvert curtain drains or shallow or no ditches at all should be considered subject to approval by the city engineer dditches must be constructed to adequately carry the anticipated water flow ebiofiltration or water quality swales and grass buffer strips are encouraged at all locations where the street gradient makes them a practical alternative to regular street ditches exh b 2010  design

within the pud shall be determined upon review of the factors below aprivacy the minimum building spacing requirement is intended to provide privacy within the dwelling unit where windows are placed in only one of the two fencing walls or there are not two windows or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows or where the windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy the building spacing may be reduced  blight and air the building spacing provides one method of ensuring that each room has adequate light and air building spacing may be reduced where there are no windows or very small window areas and where rooms have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction  cuse areas between buildings are often used as service yards for storage of trash clotheslines or other utilitarian purposes where this use is similar for both houses a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility space shall be permitted kitchens and

front yard is intended to provide privacy and usable yard area for residents in practice however front yards are rarely used so that only the privacy factor is important where a developer provides privacy by reducing traffic flow layout such as culdesacs or by screening or planting or by facing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way or room layout it is possible to reduce the front yard requirement  1991  lot width a minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long narrow buildings with inadequate privacy light and air there are situations as in culdesacs steep slopes or offset lots where because of lot configurations or topography narrow or irregular lots provide the best possible design where the design is such that light air and privacy can be provided
