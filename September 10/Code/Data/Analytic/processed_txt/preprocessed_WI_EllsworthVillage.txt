clean water act of 197 has established a moratorium on icr payments to the federal government for the period of  to  during such moratorium period the village will not collect icr charges from nonexempt industries but will continue to monitor the discharges from such industries and will compute and keep a record of the icr charges that would normally accrue during the moratorium in the event congress does not see fit to change the federal regulations requiring icr payments then those icr obligations incurred by each nonexempt industry during the moratorium will have to be satisfied after the aforesaid  date ending said moratorium said obligations incurred during the moratorium will then be collected via equal annual installments prorated over the remaining cost recovery period f
