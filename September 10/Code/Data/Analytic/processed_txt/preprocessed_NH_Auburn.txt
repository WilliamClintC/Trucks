the use of tracts in the town for nonresidential uses or for multifamily dwelling units 2 objective the goal of these regulations is to enhance the public health safety and general welfare of auburns citizens and to encourage the appropriate and wise use of land in the town these regulations are adopted to promote balanced responsible and desirable growth while considering the public health safety welfare and convenience by avoiding the haphazard and uncoordinated development of land without the adequate provision of public services or facilities  to ensure that sound site utilization principles are followed  to avoid development that may have a negative environmental or economic impact  to preserve the rural character of the town and to guide the character of development to conform with the towns master plan the general objective of these regulations is to regulate site plan review in accord with nh rsa  3 purposes in accordance with the abovestated policy and objective these regulations are adopted for the following purposes a to provide for the safe and attractive development or change or expansion of use of the site and to guard against such conditions as would involve danger or injury to health safety or prosperity by reason of i inadequate drainage or conditions conducive to flooding of the property or to the property of another  ii inadequate protection for the quality of groundwater  iii undesirable and preventable elements of pollution such as noise smoke soot particulates or any other discharge into the environment which might prove harmful to persons structures or adjacent properties  and iv inadequate provision for fire safety prevention and control  b to provide for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the town of auburn and its environs  c to provide for open spaces and green spaces of adequate proportions  d to require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within the site in relation to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map of the town of auburn  e to require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic and to afford adequate light air and access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings and to be coordinated so as to compose a convenient transportation system  f to require when appropriate that plats showing new streets or narrowing or widening of streets be submitted to the planning board for approval  g to require that the land indicated on plats submitted to the planning board shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health  h to require innovative land use controls on lands when supported by the auburn master plan  i to permit preliminary review of site plans in appropriate cases  and j to create conditions favorable for the general health safety convenience and prosperity of the citizens of auburn 104 applicability these regulations

development of the town and where consolidation of municipal services smallscale retailcommercial development limited residential use and mixed use development the towns rural charm and character is preserved the village center district is designed to promote and encourage the most efficient costeffective and beneficial consolidation of land development which will preserve open space  create more costefficient roads utilities and other public and private infrastructures  and improve the ability of the town to provide more rapid and efficient delivery of public safety services this district is

dividing the building mass into smaller scale components one way to achieve this breakdown is to provide a welldefined base middle and top to the building see example below ii bulk  the design of a building should reduce its apparent bulk by dividing the building into smaller masses ideally the internal function of the building may indicate a logical hierarchy for breaking down the mass of the building see example below by using different architectural features the perceived height and bulk are reduced to a more human scale c building orientation i building placement setbacks and building lines on the lot should be consistent and should include adjacent outdoor public space for pedestrians such as plazas sidewalks and seating areas ii building frontages and sides should be oriented towards the street and adjacent outdoor public areas presenting an active front to the community see following corner building orientation examples parking and service entrances should be located at
