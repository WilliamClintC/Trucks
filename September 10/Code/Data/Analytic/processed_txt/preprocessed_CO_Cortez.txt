desires to connect to water infrastructure that is not contiguous or front water infrastructure constructed by the initial developer and it is determined by the city engineer that the subdivision plat for the initial developer will require less capacity than projected in the initial developers reimbursement agreement then the construction cost to be reimbursed shall be adjusted based on the projected capacity required by the connectors subdivision plat and not based on the initial developers projected capacity the reimbursement amounts for the remaining properties not yet connected will not be changed from the amounts shown in the reimbursement agreement as a result of this event b drainage infrastructure constructed by the initial developer shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors the reimbursable cost will be attributed entirely to the property in which the infrastructure eligible for reimbursement is situated in the event the infrastructure is situated on more than one property the cost shall be prorated between the properties as determined by the city engineer c street infrastructure constructed by the initial developer per the master thoroughfare plan in the city limits to full width and in accordance with the city of cortez construction design standards as amended from time to time shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors based on the ratio of the connectors linear front footage to the total linear footage of the infrastructure if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on only one side of the infrastructure the connector shall reimburse 50 percent of the construction cost for that front footage if the connectors property is fronting or contiguous on both sides of the infrastructure the connector shall reimburse 100 percent of the construction cost for that front footage 2 no property will be permitted to connect to infrastructure constructed pursuant to this section or to any other part of the citys infrastructure until the obligations associated with such property under any reimbursement agreements have been paid in full no service without payment of reimbursement amounts 3 connector shall pay the entire reimbursement amount applicable to the entire property which is subject to a reimbursement agreement regardless of whether the property is subdivided payment shall be made upon execution of the developers agreement or at time of connection whichever occurs sooner however if prior to payment of the reimbursement amount the property owner has subdivided the property and sold a portion or portions to other owners the connector shall be required to pay only their pro rata reimbursement amount for their entire remaining property as determined by the city engineer notwithstanding the foregoing payment by individual residential lots is not allowed unless the individual lot existed and was occupied but not connected to the infrastructure at the time the reimbursement agreement was executed refunds or credits of reimbursement amounts will not be made as a result of reducing the number of lots in a subdivision plat 4 time limitation interest and depreciation there shall be no reimbursement payments on or after the expiration of fifteen 15 years from the date of initial acceptance of the water wastewater drainage or street infrastructure eligible for reimbursement connectors shall similarly have no obligation to make reimbursement payments on or after the expiration of said periods interest and depreciation shall be applied in the following manner a set interest rate of 3% appreciation per year shall be allowed for each year 1 to account for inflation and a depreciation of 3% per year shall be applied for each year 11  the city specifically will not guarantee payment of any portion of the reimbursable amount nothing shall be deemed or construed to be a pledge of the citys faith and credit in facilitating the equitable apportionment of the construction cost of the infrastructure it shall be the initial developers obligation to be aware of the citys publicly conducted development approval process and to timely apply for a reimbursement agreement notwithstanding the above the initial developer acknowledges that in the event he does not submit a complete and correct application for reimbursement agreement within 120 days of initial acceptance of the infrastructure or within 120 days of the adoption of this section whichever is later he will be forever barred from making such application and shall not be eligible for reimbursement 6 appeals to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order decision or requirement made in the enforcement of this section shall be pursuant to of this chapter appeals part 2008 flood damage prevention article i  title and purpose   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of colorado has in title 29 of the colorado revised statutes delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the cortez city council of the city of cortez colorado does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations     findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of cortez are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage     statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains  electric and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area     methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands   article ii  definitions
