the air safety zone districts contained in this chapter  19034 et seq said air safety zone districts are designated as follows r05a r20 a1 ba bpoa bpora cra2 and ia2 b area and yard requirements the area and yard requirements for the air safety zone districts are contained in the table of zoning regulations located at the end of this chapter75 c vertical development height standards in the air safety zone districts 1 pursuant to njac 11 et seq the following vertical height limits are established as maximum height limits for any vertical development including any structure road or tree or other object of natural growth in the air safety zone district except where this chapter shall establish more stringent height limitations in which case the more stringent limitations shall apply for purposes of this regulation a public road shall be considered a fifteenfoot vertical development and a private road a tenfoot vertical development 2 vertical development standards are vertical standards measured in respect to elevations whose datum is the horizontal plane established by runway elevations for example if a point in an airport hazard area permits at a specific point development up to x feet that means x feet above the runway horizontal plane and not x feet above the natural grade of the land at that point in the airport hazard area airport hazard areas are established by njac  and are depicted at the end of this subsection figures 1 to 6 3 the vertical standards within the runway subzone of an airport hazard area are determined first by establishing the elevations at the runway center lines at the ends of the runway subzone of the airport hazard area from those elevations at the runway subzone ends a line is run 90 outward from each side of the runway center line for a distance of 125 feet within the area defined by those four points no development is allowed above the natural grade of the soil except for runway and flight safety equipment 75editors note see table 5 schedule of general zoning regulations for andover township  190301 vehicles abandoned  19031  a the vertical standards within the remainder of the runway subzone of an airport hazard area are determined by establishing places from the edges of the longitudinal zero foot development restriction line established in 2 above which slope upward at a rate of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically this upward plane ceases when it reaches the outer longitudinal borders of the runway subzone of any airport hazard area at the elevation of 150 feet above its starting point at the longitudinal zero foot development line b the methodology used to establish the vertical standards within the runway subzone of an airport hazard area is further graphically depicted in figure 5 4 the vertical standards within the runway end subzone of an airport safety area are determined by first establishing a place with a rising slope of one foot upward to 20 feet outward from the end of the runway end subzone this place is bisected by the extended runway center line and is 250 feet in total width at its innermost dimension and widens uniformly along its length of 3000 feet so as to have total width of 850 feet at its outermost dimension where it intersects with the outermost portion of the runway end subzone at the elevation of 150 feet above its starting point at the zero foot development line d permitted uses in the air safety zone districts the specific uses permitted in the aforesaid zone districts are listed in the tables located at the end of
