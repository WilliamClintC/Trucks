the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in  a or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 2conditions for variances agenerally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items in  a have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential and otherwise

subject to the following standards as found in fema technical bulletin 1101 crawlspace construction for buildings located in special flood hazard areas 1the building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed required openings stated in  e2 below because of hydrodynamic loads crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than 5 feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional such as a registered architect or professional engineer 2the crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation and as such must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters the bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than 1 foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade 3portions of the building below the base flood elevation must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage this includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building but also any joists insulation or other materials that extend below the base flood elevation the recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above the base flood elevation 4any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above base flood elevation or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions ductwork in particular must either be placed above the base flood elevation or sealed from floodwaters 5the interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation must not be more than 2 feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade 6the height of the belowgrade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed 4 feet at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas 7there must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage well drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means 8the velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed 5 feet per second for any crawlspace for velocities in excess of 5 feet per second other foundation types should be used 9for more detailed information refer to fema technical

applicability ait is the policy of the city of canby to apply the dco zone to all lands located within the boundaries illustrated on the downtown canby framework diagram  the boundaries of the overlay district and boundaries of the three subareas are as shown in this chapter figure 11 the three subareas are established as follows  images0006858png figure 6 example of highquality screening design 1core commercial areathis area straddles highway 99e and includes portions of both the c1 and c2 zones and forms the densest commercial area of the city as well as the citys primary community facilities  city hall police station library etc 2transitional commercial area this is the transitional area that lies between the more intense downtown core commercial area and the established singlefamily neighborhoods to the north and northeast the two transitional commercial nodes are tucked between 3rd and 4th and fir and douglas on the west side of downtown and 3rd and 4th and holly and knott on the east side  images0006860png figure 7 example of wellplanned landscaping 3outer highway commercial area the outer highway commercial area extends along highway 99e both south of elm street and north of locust street this area is quite different from the core commercial and transitional commercial areas by nature of its highway access and orientation the design focus in this area is less about creating a highquality pedestrian experience and more about ensuring that automobileoriented design is built to the highest standard possible bthe dco zone has the following effect with

guidelines afindings and objectives 1the city council finds that physical appearance and design of buildings in the citys primary commercial areas has a strong impact on the communitys economic wellbeing quality of life and sense of character and identity highquality design of these buildings with special attention to the relationship between buildings people and the surrounding physical space will help spur investment in the city  enhance use and value of land and improvements  improve the stability and value of property  and generally improve the experience of residents and visitors who use these commercial areas  images0006880png figure 17 a high degree of transparency windows helps create a sense of interaction between activities inside and outside the building 2administration of design standards should be efficient and effective and provide a level of certainty for property and business owners as well as other community members it is important to provide a set of clear and objective standards that may be administered relatively quickly and easily for most applicants at the same time it is important to provide an alternative path that provides flexibility for applicants that may want to take a more innovative approach which meeting the intent of the clear and objective standards 3the objectives of the design standards in this section include the following acreate a pedestrianoriented environment of ground floors fostering interaction between activities within buildings and activities within the public realm the sidewalk and street is crucial to creating a vibrant and interesting built environment a high degree of transparency between the two realms creates visual interest for the pedestrian on the sidewalk and promotes a more active engaging pedestrian experience design of ground floor windows and building entries is important to achieving this goal in addition courtyards arcades and special paving enhance the pedestrian environment by providing pleasing semipublic transitions between the public and private realms effectively creating a threshold between the sidewalk and the building see figure 17 bestablish cohesive architectural elements welldesigned repetitive building elements tend to create a strong sense of place and leave a lasting physical memory cohesive and repetitive architectural bays along the streetfacing ground floor of a building create a pleasing sense of rhythm for the pedestrian and help to scale and order the built environment as it is experienced from the sidewalk and street see figure 18  images0006882png figure 18 cohesive visual elements like columns and lighting improve the pedestrian experience censure that buildings have a unified design providing clear distinctions between different portions of a building is important for the buildings appearance consistency of design within a larger area and the ability of people to read or understand how the building functions building facades should have a clear and distinct base middle and top figure 19 utilizing horizontal bands and changes in color and  or material  or building massing and form to differentiate these breaks the base of the building typically extends from the sidewalk to the bottom of the second story or the belt course  string course that separates the ground floor from the middle of the building see figure 19  images0006884png figure 19 design details such as a recessed entry columns and decorative transom windows help articulate the ground floor and distinguish it from the upper floors given canbys desire to create a thriving pedestrian and business district it is important that uses above the ground floor encourage housing and allow for commercial uses upper floor windows should reflect this change in use see figure 20 the middle of the building often contains smaller verticallyoriented windows to reflect changes in use on upper floors finally the top of the building contains a capping element which visually terminates the faade and creates visual interest at the top of the building  images0006886png figure 20 upper stories on these uses allow for nonretail uses which are reflected in differing window treatments and other design dreinforce the appearance and function of corners within core commercial area incorporating strong architectural elements where streets intersect not only results in a more visually interesting built environment but enhances the way pedestrians read and understand city blocks by creating recognizable and memorable design elements at the corner of each block for this reason buildings on corner lots should be designed to not only address but celebrate the corner see figure 21 euse materials that reflect the character and values of canby materials evoke emotions among visitors and residents and help define the character of the community on the positive side they can evoke a sense of timelessness permanence quality strength and creativity on the negative side they may connote feelings of transience incongruity or inconsistency weakness or tedium standards for materials are important to reflect and enhance the communitys values and quality of life see figure 22 bapplicability 1general applicability ac and section  define how and where different types of standards apply bdesign standards apply only to the following 1 new developments  2

that does not require a building permit  5temporary structures and emergency structures permitted pursuant to applicable code standards 2subareas site and design review standards are applied differently within the three subareas described below see figure 11 acore commercial subarea cc the downtown portion of this area extends primarily along 1st and 2nd avenues between cedar and knott streets and extends northward away from highway 99e along grant and holly past wait park to 4th avenue this area is the heart of canby here one will find the citys more historic traditional commercial structures the built environment is characterized by one to two story buildings with commercial storefronts built up to the sidewalk and containing a more or less solid building wall the result is a more active and vibrant street life than may be found elsewhere in the city future development in this area should continue this trend designing commercial and mixeduse buildings that adequately address the sidewalk and create an engaging experience for pedestrians see figures 23 and 24  images0006892png figure 23 these buildings in the commercial core illustrate desired design features in that area  images0006894png figure 24 the canby herald building in the commercial core incorporates many good design elements including a recessed entry sign frieze engaged columns and decorative lighting the inner highway portion of the core commercial area spans the length of highway 99e between elm and locust in many ways it serves as an extension of the downtown core just across the highway because this area serves as a gateway from highway 99e into the traditional downtown and serves many of the same purposes and types of uses buildings here should be appropriately scaled inviting to pedestrians and demonstrate highquality architectural design as a result architectural standards for this area and the downtown are identical although some development standards differ as described in section   images0006896png figure 25 example of cottage commercial design in the transitional commercial subarea  images0006898png figure 26 example of commercial development in the transitional commercial subarea btransitional commercial subarea tc this area is characterized by a mix of singlefamily homes and smallerscaled commercial developments which often take the form of conversions of existing single family homes larger front setbacks and landscaping including front yards characterize the area the future of this area will likely include commercial storefronts that address the sidewalk albeit less intense than those in the core and residential developments the overall result will be a truly mixed use neighborhood less intense than the commercial core and with more greenscape and residential uses over time commercial uses in portions of the transitional commercial district may transition to more intensive uses similar to the core downtown area and over time the relative boundaries between the two zones may shift somewhat requirements within the transitional commercial zone allow for this flexibility while ensuring appropriate transitions between this area and the core commercial subarea as well as between buildings within the transitional commercial subarea see figures 25 and 26  images0006900png figure 27 examples of development in the outer highway commercial subarea couter highway commercial subarea ohc the design focus in this area is less about creating a highquality pedestrian experience and more about ensuring that automobileoriented design is built to the highest standard possible while this goal will be largely accomplished development standards ie locating parking lots next to and behind building and the street requiring high quality landscaping particularly in front setbacks and around parking areas and requiring that buildings orient to walkways architectural design standards will also aid in this effort the result will be automobileoriented highway uses that demonstrate highquality design and that evoke a sense of permanence see figure 27 cdefinitions 1arcade  an exterior covered passageway

purpose of this division is to define subdivision partitions and related terms  to establish minimum requirements and standards necessary for efficient safe and attractive land division and development consistent with the physical characteristics of the city  to prescribe form content and procedures to be followed in the development and approval of land divisions and related maps and plats and to designate those authorized to give such approval  and to provide penalties and notice of violations authorization and minimum standards for this division are provided for by oregon revised statutes chapters 92 and 227 bland division is the most important factor in establishing the physical character of a growing community if improperly designed and executed it wastes the intrinsic value of the land and can become a costly burden to the community it is hoped that these regulations and procedures will encourage the wellplanned division of land while preventing land division with high future costs to those who will occupy the land their neighbors and the city as a whole it is further the purpose of this division 1to ensure that the public health safety convenience and general welfare be given due consideration in the division and development of land  2to help implement the comprehensive plan and elements thereof  3 to provide a means to emphasize environmental protection and preservation of the historical and natural assets of the city by encouraging orderly development relating to location number design and distribution of lots and parcels  4to minimize by proper design and development the danger to life and property caused by hazards of fire flood soil erosion and land slippage  5to provide lots parcels and development sites of a sufficient shape size and character for the purpose for which they will be used  6to provide the establishment of adequate water supply sewage disposal surface water drainage and other utilities and facilities as needed for the public health safety and convenience  7to ensure adequate provisions for transportation including roads bicycle ways and pedestrian ways which take into consideration anticipated usage safety factors and impact on the neighboring area  8to ensure that the costs of developing roads utilities and public areas serving new developments will be substantially absorbed by the benefited persons as opposed to the citizens of the city at large 9to provide adequate light air open space and recreational areas and to encourage better techniques and innovations in the arrangement of building sites andor lots and parcels section a 1984 scope of regulations subdivision plats and minor and major partition maps shall be reviewed by the commission in accordance with
