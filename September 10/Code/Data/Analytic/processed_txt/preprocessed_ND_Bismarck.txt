requirements of the accounts of the water and sewer utility fund as stated in subsection 1 f except as authorized no obligation of any kind may be issued and made payable from the net revenues unless

the wastewater treatment plant  2 to prevent the accumulation of grease within the sewer system which can lead to sanitary sewer pipe blockages and subsequent back ups and sanitary sewer overflows sso  3 to reduce the costs of maintaining the sewer system by preventing the accumulation of grease and residue within the sewage system lines and ensure that the cost of maintaining the public sewer system is equitably distributed amongst users  title 111 17 4 to clarify grease disposal requirements for fses  5 to protect public health and safety from pollution caused by sso  1110402
