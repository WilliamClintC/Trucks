small number of commercial activities along with complementary public uses residential and services concentrated in mixeduse developments along strategic points of the secondary transit system the purpose of the community shopping type 2 zone will be to minimize the distance individuals will need to travel between home work and necessary services the mixture of acceptable uses will include a core group of noninvasive commercial medical and educational uses distinctly different from normally accepted commercial applications and in deference to existing and proposed residential uses in addition to reducing dependence upon our increasingly stressed transportation system the community shopping type 2 zone will allow maximum developmental value to be achieved along designated strategic corridors it is the intention of the community shopping type 2 zone to enhance and diversify development of the towns strategic corridors and to prevent commercial residential and industrial uses that are incompatible with the longrange development goals of the town the proposed definition will read as follows community shopping type 2 zone cs2 the following mixeduse district is established the purpose of the community shopping type 2 zone is to provide for a significant and steady increase in the economic development of the town in key areas while protecting and safeguarding existing and future residential development from encroachment by incompatible uses this zone will allow a degree of latitude for potential development along designated strategic corridors in close proximity to major transportation corridors that is unavailable in transitional zoning districts the cs2 zone will allow for controlled development with a mixture of uses that are designed for their compatibility with residential development it is also expected that the cs2 zone will reduce demands on local transportation infrastructure thereby preserving quality of life within the town 1 the community shopping type 2 zone is intended to provide for commercial and limited highdensity residential uses in specific areas that are in close proximity to major transportation corridors and residential development 2 suitable development of a residential nature will be allowed as a special use within the community shopping type 2 zone within the confines developed by the planning board of adjustment

commercial activities along with complementary public uses and or highdensity residential developments concentrated along strategic points of the primary transit system that meet the towns specifications for extraordinary commercial signage the purpose of the community shopping type 3 zone will be to identify and maximize the utility of certain parcels of land that are determined by the town to meet certain criteria that prevent the application of chapter 34 as applied in similarly situated properties within other zoning districts from being effective inclusion within the community shopping type 3 zone is based upon a nonbinding determination by staff on the need for such application a recommendation by the planning board of adjustment of the town after a duly called public hearing and an independent and binding finding by a majority of the board of aldermen meeting at a duly called public hearing on such a matter in the event of a successful protest petition then a super majority of the board of aldermen would be required to enact such a zoning as outlined within the town land use ordinance parcels contained within cs type 3 zone will necessarily be adjacent to major transportation corridors alternately known as primary arterial roads as defined by and adopted by the board of aldermen of the town as they should see fit further such parcels will lend themselves to large scale andor highdensity commercial enterprise due to location access to major transportation visibility lot size or topography application for inclusion within cs type 3 zone may be made by any property holder owning title to property which he believes meets any one of the criteria for inclusion however a property owner application is not required in order for staff to recommend a site for inclusion within the cs type 3 zone the mixture of acceptable uses within the cs type 3 zone may include everything from normally accepted commercial applications to light industry to highdensity residential in addition to reducing stress upon our local transportation system the revised cs type 3 zone is designed to allow large scale commercial investment within the town to be achieved along designated strategic corridors it is the intention of the board of aldermen that the cs type 3 zone enhances opportunities for desirable commercial light industrial and highdensity residential development along the towns strategic corridors and to permit commercial residential and industrial uses that are compatible with the longrange development goals of the town further it is the intention of this article to limit the potential negative impacts of such development by regulating their location within the municipality to a higher degree than the traditional community shopping type 3 zoning designation currently allows the proposed definition will read as follows community shopping zoning cs type 3 the following mixeduse district is established the purpose of the community shopping type 3 cs type 3 zone is to provide for the economic development of the town with a focus on areas of intense commercial value located adjacent to primary arterial roads as designated by the board of aldermen of the town this zone will allow maximum latitude for potential development along strategic corridors in close proximity to major transportation corridors in addition to opening designated sections of the town for high value controlled development the mixture of uses contained within the cs type 3 zone is expected to enhance opportunities for large scale commercial investment within the corporate limits of the town further it is the intent of this article to encourage development of commercial light industrial and or high density residential development in a manner that will best serve the citizens of the town by enhancing tax base limiting stress on municipal services and infrastructure and creating opportunities for employment and investment that are deemed in the best interest of and to meet the needs of the citizens of the town as may change from time to time and are best interpreted in zoning matters by their elected officials 1 the cs type 3 zone is intended to provide for commercial light industrial and limited highdensity residential uses in specific areas that are adjacent to primary arterial corridors 2 properties located within the cs type 3 zone will be subject to the chapter 34 regulations laid out within chapter 34 for this standalone district within said district should a conflict arise between chapter 34s general requirements and the cs type 3 zone requirements then the cs type 3 zone requirements shall be deemed the defining regulations 3 suitable development of a residential nature will be allowed only as a special use within the cs type 3 zone within the confines as approved by the board of aldermen typically residential developments allowed within this district will be apartment andor condominium complexes of a high density nature 4 suitable development of certain light industrial applications will be allowed as a special use within the confines approved by the board of aldermen property owners seeking inclusion within the cs type 3 zone will need to specifically identify why their proposed use should be included within the cs type 3 zone classification unless recommendation for inclusion within said district comes from staff or independent action by the board of aldermen this article will allow for the specific prohibition of certain residential and light industrial applications within the community shopping type 3 zone 5 significant change in use without obtaining prior approval from the board of aldermen or discontinuation of use of any commercial light industrial or residential use operating under a special use permit within the cs type 3 zone shall be deemed grounds for the planning board of adjustment to begin review of the property in

disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated floodproof or otherwise protected from flood damages b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands c objectives the objectives of this section are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to
