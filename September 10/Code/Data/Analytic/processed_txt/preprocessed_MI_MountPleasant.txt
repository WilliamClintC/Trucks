general compliance requirements for storm water management practices this chapter establishes the framework detention andor retention measures will be implemented and details the process that must be followed to gain approval for new developments and redevelopment drainage systems and maintenance of storm water systems except as provided in  5403 the standards procedures and permitting requirements set forth in this chapter apply only to development and redevelopment projects as defined below and not to projects involving the construction of onefamily or twofamily dwellings or to projects involving additions extensions or modifications to such dwellings or the parcels on which they are located cthe purpose of this chapter is to accomplish among others the following objectives 1reduce artificially induced flood damage  2minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development  3minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses culverts and bridges and other structures  4encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist  5reduce nonpoint source pollution  6maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes  7minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed stability  8reduce erosion from development or construction projects  9preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution  10reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever practicable from lands that were developed without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this chapter  and 11reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and to that end this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient storm water management controls dthis chapter covers the following topics 1a summary of the procedures to be followed under this chapter including requirements review procedures inspection requirements and other agency requirements  2a description of design requirements and engineering calculations  and 3a description of minimum design criteria
