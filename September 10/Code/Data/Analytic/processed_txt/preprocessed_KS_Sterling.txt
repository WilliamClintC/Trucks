floodplain management regulations 16301 statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes a statutory authorization 1 approval of draft kansas chief engineer prior to adoption the following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 kansas statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et set and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the governing body of the city of sterling kansas ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of sterling kansas are subject to inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in anyone year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in section 16301bl  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and k ar 5444 by applying the provisions of this article to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard    16302 general provisions a lands to which article applies this article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction the city of sterling identified as numbered and unnumbered a zones ae ao and ah zones on the index map dated  of the flood insurance rate map firm in all areas covered by this article

city of sterling or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and as specifically noted in section 16304 b compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations c abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this article to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this article shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only d interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes e warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this article shall not create a liability on the part of the city of sterling any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made there under f severability if any section  clause  provision  or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or

property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is

business district to the i1 industrial district the recommending of the lesser r1 residential district shall not be valid without republication and the mailing of new notices although the notification for a special use is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment it is not an actual change in zoning districts and therefore the table of comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different use even if in the same zone the property considered for a special use however may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount
