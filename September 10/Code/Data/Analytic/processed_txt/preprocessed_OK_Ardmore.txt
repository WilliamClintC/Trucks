affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 3089a of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 3089b13089b23 of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its opdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources

property and existing land uses 2 transportation access and vehicular traffic generated must be considered when determining the most appropriate zoning district designation 3 downzoning to a less intensive use might be recommended in certain areas where the character of development has already changed or will change over time giving consideration to the existing zoning district classification and resulting permitted land uses which have been in effect for 20 years 4 industrial uses should be concentrated along major arterial roadways and the railroad to afford proper access and minimize traffic noise and visual impacts 5 major commercial uses should be concentrated along the commerce street corridor along the interstate 35 corridor and within the downtown central business district efforts should be taken to avoid stripping many of the arterial and collector streets with commercial land uses and zoning because of the resulting high number of curb access points traffic safety concerns pedestrian conflict points and potential land use conflicts with adjacent properties to the rear of commercial uses 6 office uses should be concentrated around the downtown central business district along major collector and arterial streets near the hospital and medical complex and as a transition use or buffer between residential uses and nearby commercial or industrial uses 7 multifamily uses should be located in a variety of areas around ardmore should be provided with good street access and should be used as a potential transition or buffer use between single family residential uses and nearby commercial office or industrial uses or major transportation corridors 8 public schools and parks should be located where practical and economically feasible near the clients served and with consideration given to both vehicular and pedestrian access 9 agricultural land uses should be located at the edge or fringe areas of ardmore so potential land use conflicts can be minimized and so agricultural and other associated uses can be protected from encroaching urban uses 10 high impact uses that create large amounts of noise odor traffic or other forms of identified and verified nuisances on residential land uses should be located as far as possible from residential neighborhoods or as an alternative positive measures must be taken to mitigate negative impacts on nearby neighborhoods 11 commercial and industrial land uses when located along major transportation entrance corridors to ardmore shall give care and concern for appearance design visual impact and traffic safety 12 spot zoning the zoning of a small individual parcel of land different from the majority of other zoning district classifications in the surrounding area shall generally be discouraged but may be used as a buffer zone or for public benefit 13 single family residential land uses should include small lots medium sized lots and provisions for large estate type lots and all primary residential uses within neighborhoods should back or side onto arterial streets in order to encourage quiet safe and lowvolume localized traffic movements 14 higher intensity land uses should be strategically placed and developed with design features that utilize increased setbacks landscaping berms fencing buffering uses and other separations to be compatible with low intensity development 15 large communityserving shopping areas major retail and service activities should be located at the intersection of arterial or collector streets 16 in addition to the above outlined policies used for zoning district designations there are certain sensitive development corridors and areas which must undergo further planning study as development pressures increase and as applications are received for either annexation rezoning and subdivision actions these sensitive corridors and areas include a the north and south interstate 35 corridor  b the east highway 199

finding of fact the periodic flooding of areas within the city of ardmore results in hazards to life and property in the disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare flood and associated losses are caused by the location in flood hazard areas of buildings structures and uses of land which are inadequately protected from flooding and erosion and which contribute to flooding by impeding the flow of drainage and by increasing flood heights of storm water in floodway and floodfringe areas c classification of drainage channels for the purpose of these regulations drainage shall be classified as follows 1 surface drainage is runoff of such a limited quantity andor slow rate that it does not cause erosion of a defined channel 2 a minor tributary is any drainage channel having a drainage basin of 100 acres or less in area 3 a major tributary is any channel having a drainage basin of not less than 1 square mile or greater than 25 square miles d designation of responsibility it is intended that responsibility for drainage

drainage within the subdivision and future developed flows from upstream properties and shall convey same to a point on an identified existing stream system such stream system shall have the hydraulic capability to accommodate the increased surface water flow or be modified by the developer in a manner which will do so b obtaining offsite flowage easements and the construction of facilities to accommodate increased flow such shall be dedicated to the city where such offsite facilities are necessary the city shall allow the developer the option of constructing onsite retarding and retention structures when environmental and economic conditions prohibit or make unfeasible offsite improvements c the improvement of all minor and major tributaries and channels lying within the subdivision d

shall be designated on the preliminary and the final plat and shall be clearly marked f alternative methods for determining stream flow and runoff characteristics and drainage structure capacities for all areas not otherwise designated in a floodway or a floodfringe area the developer shall be responsible for having an engineer registered in oklahoma prepare a drainage assessment of all of the area of the proposed subdivision and all area affected by runoff resulting from development of proposed subdivision in accordance with the following provisions 1 the 100year flow analysis shall be used as a minimum basis for the sizing of all drainage channels bridges and other critical structures unless otherwise specified herein other design storms should be evaluated as conditions dictate 2 the calculation of all runoff shall be based on saturated urbanization of the drainage basin for minor tributaries and surface drainage as reflected in the comprehensive plan for the city or as specified by the city engineer and shall be based on the maximum degree of urbanization as reflected in the comprehensive plan for the drainage basin of a major tributary or river 3 the calculation of stream flow and runoff characteristics of the subdivision shall be carried out in consultation with the city engineer and the methodology and formulas used shall result in quantities comparable to those derived from the application of the following formulas and values a runoff from all drainage areas less than 100 acres shall be not less than determined by rational formula q   c ia q   cubic feet per

suitable finish grades at building foundations can be established all elevations shall be referenced to us coast and geodetic survey data g flood hazard areas on major tributaries and rivers all floodway and flood fringe areas located within the subdivision shall be protected and improved by the developer as follows 1 all floodways shall be designated as flowage easements and shall be maintained as permanent open space for use for private recreation or agriculture for which no buildings or structures are required or dedicated to the public for drainage recreation and utility use 2 all flood fringe areas shall be planned for uses which are permitted in the flood fringe area of the zoning ordinance and in no case shall the proposed use or construction cause a displacement of flood water in the flood fringe that will increase flooding in other areas of the floodway or flood fringe 3 when it is determined by the city engineer that the development of the subdivision will significantly increase runoff in the flood hazard area or will otherwise adversely affect storm water runoff the planning commission may require any or all of the following to the extent needed to reduce the adverse affects of the development a the existing floodway laying within or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water and the channel shall be straightened widened and improved to the extent required to prevent overflow beyond the limits of the floodway b site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites and

rip rapping of bank g construction of closed or open paved storm sewers for the purposes of closing gap or continuation of overall storm sewer system 3 property owner agreements where required shall be designed to protect the city from probable law suits for damage caused by changed runoff condition 4 when subdivision development will result in increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the subdivision which cannot be accommodated improvements without causing downstream flooding the planning commission may require the construction of one or more detention reservoirs on the subdivision which will temporarily impound and discharge water from the subdivision site at the rate and volume equivalent to the discharge from the undeveloped subdivision site at a rate and volume that the offsite channel is capable of taking the design shall be for a 100year frequency flood plans shall be approved by the city engineer the construction shall be the responsibility of the developer the responsibility for maintenance shall be determined on a case by case basis during the subdivision review process  guidelines for extending streets and utilities purpose and intent the purpose and intent of this section is to provide a method with guidelines for extending streets water lines sanitary sewer and storm sewer lines for existing development newly developed areas and individual improvements within the city of ardmore and who may petition the city for such improvements or be required to connect to said utilities the city commission may use any of a variety of methods for said extensions including but not limited to property owner funding with or without buyin agreements shared costs methods bonds and special improvement districts the city commission shall determine the

are and as may be from time to time provided by oklahoma law and other city codes for the violation of zoning subdivision or related udc provisions i remedies cumulative the remedies and enforcement powers established in this chapter are cumulative enforcement procedures a nonemergency matters 1 in the case of violations of this udc that do not constitute an emergency the building official shall give notice of the nature of the violation to the property owner and to any other person who is party to the agreement and to any applicant for any relevant permit after which the persons receiving notice shall have 10 days or such longer period as the building official allows to correct the violation 2 if the violation is not corrected within the required timeframe the building official and city attorney shall use all penalties remedies and enforcement powers available under this chapter 3 notice must be given inperson by united states mail or by posting notice on the premises notices of

behalf of the city to enforce this udc b temporary signs banners projects signs real estate signs political signs sidewalk or sandwich signs snipe signs special event signs and any other temporary signs are subject to removal pursuant to the following provisions 1 the city commission finds that in view of the inexpensive nature of these signs and the administrative burden that would be imposed by elaborate procedural prerequisites prior to removal any procedure other than summary removal of these signs when unlawfully erected and maintained would defeat the purpose of regulating such signs 2 therefore the city is hereby authorized summarily to remove such signs when unlawfully erected and maintained enforcement actions involving agricultural operators before taking enforcement action to correct a violation of this udc by any agricultural operator the city commission shall investigate the alleged violation to determine whether a violation of this udc exists and whether the activity is protected under the citys right to farm and ranch policy see  as historical traditional reasonable and legitimate definitions general for the purpose of this udc certain terms and words are to be used and interpreted as defined in this chapter rules of construction the following rules of construction shall be used when construing this udc 1 words used in the present tense shall include the future tenses  words in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular except where the natural construction of the writing indicates otherwise 2 the word shall is mandatory and not directory 3 the word building includes the word structure use categories a basis for classifications use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional product or physical characteristics characteristics include the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions the use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts b principal uses principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use the characteristics subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use 1 developments with multiple principal uses when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category a development that contains a coffee shop bookstore and bakery for example would be classified in the retail sales and service category because all of the developments principal uses are in that category when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category 2 accessory uses accessory uses are allowed byright in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations also unless otherwise stated accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions 3 use of examples the examples subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category the names of these sample uses are generic they are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself for example a use that calls itself wholesale warehouse but that
