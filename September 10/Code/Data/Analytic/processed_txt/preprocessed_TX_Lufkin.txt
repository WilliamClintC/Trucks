loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the

prevention requirements a no water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this article service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this article is not installed tested and maintained or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed or if an unprotected crossconnection exists on the premises service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected b the customers system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether crossconnections or other structural or sanitary hazards including violations of these regulations exist when such a condition becomes known the city engineer or his designee shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the    437590 service line until the customer has corrected the conditions in conformance with state and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto c an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customers water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served but in all cases before the first branch line leading off the service wherever the following conditions exist 1 in the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the city engineer or hisher designee the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard 2 in the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard this shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality 3 in the case of premises having i internal crossconnections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled or ii intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous crossconnections exist the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line d the type of protective assembly required under subsections c1 2 and 3 of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows 1 in the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection c1 and it is not subject to any of the following rules the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap

health if introduced into the public water system the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly 3 in the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants sewage pumping stations chemical manufacturing plants hospitals mortuaries and plating plants 4 in the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled crossconnections either actual or potential the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection 5 in the case of any premises where because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a complete inplant crossconnection survey the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises 6 in the case of any premises where in the opinion of the city engineer or hisher designee an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances the city engineer or hisher designee may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system this requirement will be at the discretion of the city engineer or hisher designee and is dependent on the degree of hazard    438590 e 1 any

period for which no history exists the city manager shall give hisher best effort to see that notice of each nonresidential customers allocation is mailed to the customer if however a customer does not receive the notice it shall be the customers responsibility to contact the city to determine the allocation upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager the allocation may be reduced or increased if i the designated period does not accurately reflect the customers normal water usage  ii one nonresidential customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another

allocation shall be established by the city manager or hisher designee for each industrial customer which uses water for processing purposes the industrial customers allocation shall be approximately 85% of the customers water usage baseline ninety days after the initial imposition of the allocation for industrial customers the industrial customers allocation shall be further reduced to 80% of the customers water usage baseline the industrial customers water usage baseline will be computed on the average water usage for the 12month period ending prior to the date of implementation of stage 2 of the plan if the industrial water customers billing history is shorter than 12 months the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no billing history exists the city manager shall give hisher best effort to see that notice of each industrial customers allocation is mailed to the customer if however a customer does not receive the notice it shall be the customers responsibility to contact the city to determine the allocation and the allocation shall be fully effective notwithstanding the lack of receipt of written notice upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager the allocation may be reduced or increased if i the designated period does not accurately reflect the customers normal water usage because the customer had shut down a major processing unit for repair or overhaul during the period  ii the customer has added or is in the process of adding significant additional processing capacity
