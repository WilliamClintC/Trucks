the foregoing criteria shall serve as guidelines in establishing sites the village president and board of trustees may authorize such modifications thereof as in their judgment are warranted 3 credit for private open spaces and recreation areas when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public

the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site or where land for recreational or a school site purposes has already been obtained the village shall require the subdivider or developer to make a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required to be used for the purpose of land acquisition or site development or both within the village of palatine 1 the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites a it has been determined that the fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is set forth in the villages current fee schedule supplement to the palatine ordinances and that fair market value amount shall be used in making any calculation herein b if the developer objects to the fair market value as determined herein the corporate authorities shall select a qualified appraiser to appraise the property at the developers expense i if the corporate authorities are dissatisfied with the appraisal it may hire an appraiser at its own expense to appraise the property ii the fair market value shall be based on the average of the two 2 appraisals provided for herein 2 the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication or school sites shall be paid to the village on a pro rata per residential unit basis as part of the building permit fee at the time of building permit issuance 3 in the event that a residential unit or units located on land being subdivided are demolished within two months of or are planned to be demolished subsequent to the recordation of the plat of subdivision the cash contribution set forth in this shall be reduced to reflect those existing residential unit or units by way of example if a ten 10 lot residential subdivision is proposed for property containing two 2 existing residential units then the cash contribution would be paid in full for eight 8 units and amount paid for the remaining two 2 units would recognize the existing residential units which may result in a reduced impact fee for the remaining two 2 residential units the reduction in the applicable fee for the two 2 remaining units shall be the difference between the population generation as set forth in of the existing residential units to be demolished and the population generation of the two 2 new residential units that will be located within the subdivision and most proximate to where the demolished unit or units previously existed 4 the village shall pay over such contributions to the park district or school district entitled thereto upon proper certification from such district that the funds so said will be
