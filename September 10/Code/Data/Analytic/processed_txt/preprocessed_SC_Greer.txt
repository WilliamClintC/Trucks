striking down those ordinances because municipalities and counties in south carolina have no power to enact local ordinances prohibiting public nudity nor ordinances inconsistent with the constitution or general laws of the state nothing in this article is intended to depart from those decisions and shall not be so construed it has also considered the decision in state v bouye 325 sc 260 490 se2d 161997 sustaining the verdict of a spartanburg county general sessions jury that beyond a reasonable doubt a topless dancing establishment in spartanburg county violated state statute by multiple acts of lewd and lascivious behavior over a period of more than half a year the sheriffs files show many secondary criminal effects having no free speech implications of that and the other sexually oriented businesses regulated by this ordinance the county has conducted an extensive review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities including but not limited to islip new york 1980  phoenix arizona 1979  indianapolis indiana 1984  city of los angeles california 1977  austin texas 1986  whittier california 1978  new hanover county north carolina 1989  and manatee county florida 1987  has conducted its own studies of real estate appraisers commercial businesses residential owners and parents in spartanburg county  2 from review of information from our sheriffs office and our citizens other cities studies and their own surveys and testimony from its citizens there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing among other adverse secondary effects increased crime and downgrading of property values  3 sexually oriented businesses in the county of spartanburg require special supervision from public safety and health agencies of the county in order to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as citizens of the county  4 it is recognized that sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are operating in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to crime lower property values urban blight and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area produce very loud music  5 the county council finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution sexual liaison of a casual nature  6 increased crime and unhealthful conduct tend to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented business including but not limited to prostitution pandering exposing minors to materials possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property  7 concern over sexually transmitted diseases including aids is a legitimate health concern of the county which demands reasonable regulations of sexually oriented business in order to protect the health and well being of the citizens  8 the county council has considered in part each of the following matters a areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of sexually oriented business uses b areas where children could be expected to walk patronize or frequent to be free of sexually oriented business uses  c sexually oriented business uses should be located in areas of the county which are not in close proximity to residential uses churches parks or other public facilities and schools  d the image of the county of spartanburg as a pleasant attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented business uses in close proximity to residential land uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools  e sexually oriented business land use should be regulated by land use provisions to separate it from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself  f residents of the county of spartanburg and persons who are nonresidents but use the county for shopping and other commercial needs will move from the community or shop elsewhere if sexually oriented businesses land uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools  g merchants in the commercial area of the county are concerned about the adverse impact and the character and quality of the county in the event that sexually oriented business land uses are located within close proximity to residential uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools and that such locations will reduce retail trade to commercial uses in the vicinity thus reducing property values and tax revenues to the county  and that such adverse effect on property values and businesses would cause the loss to some commercial districts within the county leading to further deterioration of the commercial quality of the county  and h no evidence has been presented to show that location of sexually oriented businesses within the county will improve the commercial viability or quality of life of the community  9 controlling the location of certain businesses permitting and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to insure the operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places which minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation  10 the county recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values  11 the county council finds that there would be a deterioration in the quality of businesses which choose to operate in and around such sexually oriented businesses  12 the county council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens protect and citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and social diseases  13 the county

v wiener et al 3 cal 4th 832 1993 topanga press inc et al v city of los angeles 989 f2d 1524 1993  14 the county council has determined that location criteria alone does not adequately protect health safety and general welfare of the people of spartanburg county and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented businesses is in the public interest  15 the county council consistent with sale and consumption of alcohol and outside advertising limitations further finds that restricted hours of operation will further prevent the adverse secondary

and 25 articles 5 and 7 and title 6 amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the greer city council of greer south carolina does ordain this chapter as follows  findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs  lands to

of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free

ordinance future changes or additions to these limitations shall be developed set and adopted by cpw and will be published by cpw and when adopted by cpw be automatically incorporated into attachment a the general manager may allow for a categorical user to request a variance from an applicable categorical standard or local limitation the request may be allowed when factors relating to a categorical user are fundamentally different from the factors considered during the development of a categorical pretreatment standard applicable to the categorical user a revised standard may be allowed as follows 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of this section 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the general manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e and sc r619 f 4 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that cpw convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the general manager cpw may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth as follows a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys total actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period at least three years prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the general manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 4a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the general manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 4a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the general manager 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 90106 below the industrial user must also be in compliance with section 90111 regarding the prohibition of bypass 5 the general manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits sc r619 d5 for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users when converting such limits to concentration limits the concentrations in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 shall be applied also documentation shall be provided that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited under section 90106 of this ordinance the conversion is at the discretion of the general manager 6 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 7 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 8 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the general manager within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the general manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate 9 the general manager at his discretion may reduce or waive categorical pretreatment standards if an industrial user subject to the categorical pretreatment standards is determined to be a nonsignificant categorical user the general manager may determine that an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a nonsignificant categorical industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day gpd of total categorical wastewater excluding sanitary noncontact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard and the following conditions are met

unconstitutional or invalid such decision shall not affect impair or invalidate the remaining provisions of this authority the provisions of the adopted under authority of the south carolina local government comprehensive planning enabling act of 199 sc revision 1102 gp4 traffic impact study analysis 21 purpose a traffic impact study assesses the effects that a commercial developments projected traffic generation will have on the surrounding transportation network these studies vary in their range of detail and complexity depending on the type size and location of the development these studies are important in assisting public agencies to make land use decisions they can also be used to help evaluate whether a development is appropriate for a site with respect to traffic impact and what type of transportation improvements may be necessary to accommodate the traffic generated by development traffic impact studies help communities to  forecast additional traffic associated with new development based on accepted practices   determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development   allocate scarce resources to areas which need improvements   reduce the negative impacts of development by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the new development   assist decision makers in assessing any zoning change which is requested in anticipation of the development 22 definitions average daily traffic the average daily traffic adt is the total volume passing a point of segment of a road facility in both directions during a 24hour period it is commonly obtained during a given time period usually it is abbreviated as adt level of service the concept of level of service uses qualitative measures that characterize operational conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and passengers the descriptions of individual levels of service characterize these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and travel time freedom to maneuver traffic interruptions and comfort and convenience six levels of service are defined by the highway capacity manual 2000 for signalized intersections based upon available procedures they are given letter designations from a to f with los a representing the best operating conditions and los f the worst each level of service represents a range of operating conditions see table 1 revision 1102 gp5 modal split modal split refers to the distribution of all person trips generated by development among the various transportation modes available ie automobile drivealone shared ride transit motorcycle bicycle walking 23 traffic study required the developer shall complete a traffic impact study whenever new construction is expected to generate 100 or more traffic trips during the peak hour or when the redevelopment of an existing project generates 125 or more trips during the peak hour notwithstanding the trip generation threshold for the purposes of the c1 central business district cbd a traffic impact study shall be required on when the anticipated exiting trip exceeds 150 for any one house based on the directions distributional model provided in latest edition of trip generation published by the institute of transportation engineers as determined by the city engineer the higher threshold for the cbd is established in recognition that the cbd intended under the citys future land use plan to be location of greater land use density having a significant amount of traffic patterns in promoting economic development for the area examples of
