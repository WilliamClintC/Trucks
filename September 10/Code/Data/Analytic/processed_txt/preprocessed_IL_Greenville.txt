zoning districts or special zoning districts instead they are forms of development that may be permitted in the various zoning districts established by the udc the use patterns typically involve multiple uses on the same property they are described here and in the base zoning district regulations  table a of this chapter as a landuse activity in order to trigger the appropriate development approval process some multipleuse developments such as pd planned development districts see   of this chapter are permitted special or overlay zoning district however a planned development is not a landuse activity but rather a procedure for providing design flexibility by contrast the use patterns are specific landuse activities involving landuse and design controls that produce a distinct

to transit and to limit conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians and transit operations the zone allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development uses and development are regulated to create a more intense builtup environment that is oriented to pedestrians and to provide a density and intensity that is transit supportive 2the development standards of the zone are also designed to encourage a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment near transit stations by encouraging an intensive

on small areas of land the city finds that uses inconsistent with transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a tod and may render the transit system unworkable accordingly the uses permitted within the tod zoning districts are those that are dependent upon or which may generate a relatively high level of transit usage uses that interfere with transit usage and that generate few transit trips are not permitted further the city finds and determines that minimum levels of density as set forth in this section are required to support transit ridership and that lower levels of density will not support transit ridership and will create unacceptable levels of vehicular congestion bpermitted conditional and prohibited uses shall comply with the use matrix

and findings  introduction athis chapter establishes zoning districts and describes the use and design regulations that apply to each district several types of zoning districts are established 1division 4 base zoning districts establishes districts that divide the local government into various residential commercial and industrial zones each district establishes uses that are permitted as of right and as a conditional use a use permitted as of right is compatible with the other uses within the purpose of the district and therefore requires only administrative approval conditional uses require a public hearing to assess whether conditions are needed in order to make the use compatible with other uses in the district  2division 5 overlay zoning districts establishes districts within which the standards of both the base and overlay zoning districts apply these districts address special situations that require additional regulations to protect the public health safety and general welfare  3division 6 flexible zoning establishes incentives in the form of additional density and other regulatory measures in order to encourage the provision of affordable housing the preservation of environmental resources the dedication of rightsofway for arterial streets and the redevelopment of underutilized sites landowners are permitted to transfer densities from sites that are inappropriate for development to sites that are suitable for increases in density  and 4the supplemental use regulations in division 16 establish regulations for some uses that are permitted in a zoning district but raise special concerns that require additional uniform regulations the regulations set forth apply regardless of whether the use is permitted as of right or as a conditional use within the district b1pursuant to 65 ilcs 51113 the purpose of this section is to promote the public health safety morals or general welfare and to protect and preserve places and areas of historical cultural or architectural importance and significance these regulations are adopted in accordance with the comprehensive plan and are designed to alessen congestion in the streets  bsecure safety from

 establishment of districts aarea system 1the city finds that its rural suburban and urban areas have substantially different physical geographic and functional characteristics that require alternative regulatory treatment rural areas are largely undeveloped and are characterized by woodlands agricultural lands horse farms and scattered residential and commercial uses at very low densities suburban areas are automobile oriented with automedium densities frontloaded garages and separate commercial areas residents of suburban neighborhoods desire a living environment that favors the values of security and privacy urban neighborhoods are more compact and pedestrian friendly reflecting traditional community character and architecture residents of urban neighborhoods prefer a strong sense of community and a mixeduse living environment 2a rural area a suburban area and a traditional area are established by this section in order to provide a framework for assigning landuse

classification while a more general classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another use the specific classification governs the specific use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar lbcs or naics code number the numbers increase as the classifications get more specific  table b permitted use terminology the letter  has the following meaning  p permitted uses the letter p indicates that the listed use is permitted by right within the zoning district permitted uses are subject to all other applicable standards of this chapter c conditional uses the letter c indicates that the listed use is permitted within the respective zoning district only after review and approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with the review procedures of   this chapter a accessory uses the letter a indicates that the listed use is permitted only where it is accessory to another use that is permitted in the district on the same lot  prohibited uses a dash indicates that the use is not permitted in the district  bsome uses are listed separately but fall within the same lbcs or naics classification the uses within one such classification are not permitted in all of the zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the same lbcs or naics classification for example naics 5413 architectural engineering and related services is coded under office general assume that the use matrix  table a above sets out a classification for laboratories testing which is naics 54138 testing laboratories a subheading of 54183 the latter fivedigit number ie 54183 is more specific than the fourdigit code ie 5413 accordingly testing laboratories is not

overlay zoning district symbol as a suffix for example if a parcel is zoned ns neighborhood suburban and is also located within an np neighborhood preservation overlay zoning district the zoning designation of the property is nsnp in effect the designation of property as being within the np district places such property in a new zoning district classification and all procedures and

apply legislative development approvals include any change in the comprehensive or specific plan any change to the text of the udc any rezoning and any creation of a pd planned development district or floating zone bquasijudicial development approval a quasijudicial development approval involves the application of a discretionary standard required by this chapter to an application it requires a public hearing procedural due process requirements apply as established in   this chapter examples include master development approvals conditional use permits cups variances and administrative appeals cministerial development approvals ministerial development approvals involve the application of the standards of the udc to an application by an administrative official or agency a public

analyses ageneral 1the intent of this subdivision is to provide the information necessary to allow decisionmakers to assess the transportation implications of sitegenerated traffic associated with a proposed development the goal is to address the transportationrelated issues associated with development proposals that may be of concern to neighboring residents business owners and property owners and to provide a basis for negotiation regarding improvements and funding participation in conjunction with an application for development 2the isolated and cumulative impact of the proposed development needs to be understood in relation to the existing and proposed capacity of the street system and to ensure that traffic congestion will be maintained at reasonable levels so as not to hinder the passage of public safety vehicles degrade the quality of life or contribute to hazardous traffic conditions this section establishes requirements for the analysis and evaluation of transportation impacts associated with proposed developments bpurpose and findings the purpose of the traffic impact report is to identify the impacts on capacity level of service los and safety which are likely to be created by a proposed development a traffic impact report should identify the improvements needed to 1ensure safe ingress to and egress from a site  2maintain adequate street capacity on adjacent public streets  3ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and at intersections in the vicinity of a proposed development  4avoid creation of or mitigate existing hazardous traffic conditions  5minimize the impact of nonresidential traffic on residential neighborhoods in the community  and 6protect the substantial public investment in the existing street system ctypes of studies traffic impact studies may be required at several stages in the development process no application for development will be accepted without an appropriate traffic impact report the types of traffic impact reports required under the chapter are as follows 1a traffic impact report will be required for any application for a development order for any change in the comprehensive or specific plan any change to the text of the udc any rezoning or any creation of a proposed development or floating zone the purpose of such study will be to evaluate whether adequate transportation capacity exists or will be available within a reasonable time period to safely and conveniently accommodate proposed uses permitted under the requested landuse or zoning classification 2a traffic impact report will also be required for certain permitted and conditional uses and major subdivisions exceeding specific trip generation thresholds the purpose of a traffic impact report will be to aevaluate traffic operations and impacts at site access points under projected traffic loads  bevaluate the impact of sitegenerated traffic on affected intersections in the vicinity of the development site  cevaluate the impact of sitegenerated traffic on the quality of traffic flow on public streets located in the vicinity of the site  devaluate the impact of the proposed development on residential streets in the vicinity of the site  eensure that site access and other improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impact of the development meet commonly accepted engineering design standards and access management criteria  and fensure that adequate facilities for pedestrians transit users and bicyclists have been provided 3all land subdivisions that do not require a traffic impact report will be required to complete a traffic design analysis the purpose of a traffic design analysis will be to aensure that the proposed street layout is consistent with the public roadway design standards  bensure the proper design and spacing of site access points and identify where limitations on access should be established  censure that potential safety problems have been properly evaluated and addressed  densure that internal circulation patterns will not interfere with traffic flow on existing public streets  and eensure that appropriate facilities for pedestrians transit users and bicyclists have been provided in plans for the development dapplicability 1a traffic impact report shall also be required for any major subdivision cup or site plan under the following described conditions aa proposed rezoning that could generate 150 or more directional trips during the peak hour or at least 1000 more trips per day than the most intensive use that could be developed under existing zoning  ba project on a site located along or which has the potential to take access within 500 feet of a corridor identified as a freeway or expressway on the thoroughfare plan  or ca proposed development for a three and onehalfacre or larger site 2where a traffic impact report is required the acceptance of the application for the purposes of beginning the mandatory 60day time limit applicable to action shall not commence until the traffic impact report has been reviewed for completeness and has been accepted by the officer as meeting the content requirements of the udc the applicant shall be notified within ten days if the traffic impact report is found to be inadequate 3traffic design analysis shall be required for any subdivision or general development plan for which a traffic impact report is not required traffic design analyses completed at an early stage of development may need to be updated to include more detail as development plans become more specific or approval actions result in the reformulation of plans as part of the review for determining whether a development application is complete proposals for which an earlier traffic design analysis or traffic impact report has been completed will be reviewed to ensure consistency with previous approvals or to identify the need for revision or refinement of previously completed analyses or reports ewaiver the requirements of this section for a traffic impact report may be waived by the citys officer upon a determination that such report is not necessary to determine needed road improvements or that no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be created by the development as proposed developments in the central development core district that are not required to provide onsite offstreet parking are exempt from the requirements of this section fpreparation the applicant may choose to have a traffic impact report prepared by a qualified professional with experience in the preparation of such analysis or may choose to have the officer prepare a report once the development application is submitted where the applicant chooses to have the officer prepare the report the time frame for the officer to render a decision shall be extended by 45 days to permit time to prepare the report the applicant shall be responsible for the costs of preparation of the traffic study incurred by the officer gtraffic service standards the standards for traffic service that shall be used to evaluate the findings of traffic impact reports or analyses are as follows 1capacity a volumetocapacity vc ratio of 080 shall not be consistently exceeded on any freeway or expressway as designated on the thoroughfare plan and a vc ratio of 090 shall not be consistently exceeded on any arterial or collector street as designated on the thoroughfare plan consistently means that the vc ratios are exceeded based on average daily peakhour traffic counts projections or estimates 2level of service for corridors including mainline merging areas and ramp junctions an los c shall be maintained on any expressway freeway or arterial and an los d on any other designated nonlocal street on the thoroughfare plan at all intersections an los c shall be maintained on any arterial or higherorder street and an los d on any other nonresidential street where the existing los is below these standards the traffic impact report shall identify those improvements or transportation demand management techniques needed to maintain the existing los and what additional improvements would be needed to raise the los to the standards indicated 3number of access points the number of access points provided shall be the minimum needed to provide adequate access capacity for the site evidence of los d operations for individual public street movements at access locations is a primary indication of the need for additional access points however the spacing and geometric design of all access points shall be consistent with the access management criteria of the udc 4residential street impact average daily traffic on residential streets shall be within the ranges spelled out in the thoroughfare plan for the class of street involved no nonresidential development shall increase the traffic on a residential street with at least 300 average daily trips by more than 25% and shall contribute no more than 20% of the traffic on any street segment providing residential access 5traffic flow and progression the location of new traffic signals or proposed changes to cycle lengths or timing patterns of existing signals to meet los standards shall not interfere with the goal of achieving adequate traffic progression on major public streets in the vicinity of the development 6vehicle storage the capacity of storage bays and auxiliary lanes for turning traffic shall be adequate to ensure that turning traffic will not interfere with flows on any public street 7internal circulation onsite vehicle circulation and parking patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic on any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic 8safety access points shall be designed to provide for adequate sight distance and appropriate facilities to accommodate acceleration and deceleration of site traffic where traffic from the proposed development will impact any location with an incidence of high accident frequency defined as one of the five to ten highest accident locations in the area the accident history should be evaluated and a determination made that the proposed site access or additional site traffic will not further aggravate the situation it is understood that the correction of an existing offsite safety deficiency is not typically the responsibility of the developer hcontents a traffic impact report shall contain information addressing the factors listed in subsections h1 h9 below 1site description the traffic impact report shall contain illustrations and narratives that describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent land uses as well as expected development in the vicinity that will influence future traffic conditions a description of potential uses and traffic generation to be evaluated shall be provided a description of the proposed development including access plans staging

intersections and access points to be analyzed the focus shall be on intersections and access points adjacent to the site roadways or intersections within onehalf mile of the site where at least 5% of the existing peakhour capacity will be composed of trips generated by the proposed development shall be included in the analysis 3existing traffic conditions the traffic impact report shall contain a summary of the data utilized in the study and an analysis of existing traffic conditions including atraffic count and turning movement information including the source of and date when traffic count information was collected  bcorrection factors that were used to convert collected traffic data into representative designhour traffic volumes  croadway characteristics including the design configuration of existing or proposed roadways existing traffic control measures eg speed limits and traffic signals and existing driveways and turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site  and didentification of the existing los for roadways and intersections without project development traffic using methods documented in the highway capacity manual 20001 or comparable accepted methods of evaluation los should be calculated for the weekday peak hour and in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic the saturday peak hour 4horizon years and background traffic growth the traffic impact report shall identify the horizon years that were analyzed in the study the background traffic growth factors for each horizon year and the method and assumptions used to develop the background traffic growth unless otherwise approved by the officer the impact of development shall be analyzed for the year after the development is completed and ten years after the development is completed 5time periods to be analyzed for each defined horizon year specific time periods are to be analyzed for most land uses this time period will be the weekday peak hours however certain uses eg major retail centers schools or recreational uses will have characteristic peak hours different than that found for adjacent streets and these unique peak hours may need to be analyzed to determine factors such as proper site access and turn lane storage requirements the officer shall be consulted for determination of the peak hours to be studied 6trip generation reduction and distribution the traffic impact report shall summarize the projected peak hour and average daily trip generation for the proposed development and illustrate the projected trip distribution of trips to and from the site and should identify the basis of the trip generation reduction and distribution factors used in the study 7traffic assignment the traffic impact report shall identify projected designhour traffic volumes for roadway segments intersections or driveways in the study area with and without the proposed development for the horizon years of the study 8impact analysis the traffic impact report shall address the impact of traffic volumes of the projected horizon years relative to each of the applicable traffic service standards and shall identify the methodology utilized to evaluate the impact the weekday peakhour impact shall be evaluated as well as the saturday peak hour for those uses exhibiting high levels of weekend traffic generation 9mitigationalternatives in situations where the traffic los standards are exceeded the traffic impact report shall evaluate each of the following alternatives for achieving the traffic service standards by aidentifying where additional rightsofway are needed to implement mitigation strategies  bidentifying suggested phasing of improvements where needed to maintain compliance with traffic service standards  and cidentifying the anticipated cost of recommended improvements iprocess for the review and preparation of a traffic impact report this section provides an outline of the steps to be included in the preparation and review of a traffic

components eg pedestrian and bicycle paths or transit improvements to reduce vehicular trip generation  kimplement traffic demand management strategies eg carpool or vanpool programs flex time staggered work hours and telecommuting to reduce vehicular trip generation  and lrecommend denial of the application for development for which the traffic study is submitted 2the planning commission may recommend and the governing board may adopt a statement of principle partially or fully exempting a project from meeting the traffic service standards where it finds that the social andor economic benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts of the project the city council may temporarily exempt certain street locations from some or all of the traffic service standards owing to special circumstances that make it undesirable or unfeasible to provide further capacity improvements at these locations 3these special circumstances may include a finding that there would be significant negative fiscal economic social or environmental impact from further construction or that a significant portion of the traffic is generated by development outside the control of the city however where these conditions exist the governing board will make every effort to design alternate improvements and development projects affecting these areas may be required to implement traffic demand management

channel traffic onto relatively few points of the transportation network causes undue congestion a wellconnected street network spreads traffic efficiently provides greater opportunities for access by service and emergency vehicles and furthers pedestrian mobility by increasing the number of destinations that can be reached by walking accordingly this section provides for both external and internal connectivity external connectivity is promoted by requiring developers to connect to the existing street network internal connectivity is promoted by requiring a connectivity index for internal streets the city acknowledges that there is a market for culdesacs and streets with few connections the connectivity index preserves the opportunity to provide culdesacs while maintaining the integrity of the network as a whole bconnectivity index for internal streets the streets within any proposed subdivision shall provide a connectivity index of at least 120 a use pattern established by division 2 of this chapter may require a higher ratio the connectivity ratio is computed by dividing the number of street links by the number of nodes within the subdivision for purposes of this section the intersection of a local street within the proposed subdivision with an arterial or collector street providing access to a proposed subdivision is not considered a node in computing the connectivity ratio the connectivity ratio does not apply to minor subdivisions cprojecting streets where abutting areas are not subdivided the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall connect

preserving an interconnected street system culdesacs and deadend streets do not promote street connectivity and create inefficiencies in the distribution of traffic and water as well as inefficiencies and increased municipal expenses in the delivery of public services in limited situations culdesacs can be used to avoid disturbing sensitive environmental features in addition there is a strong market demand for culdesac lots in many communities accordingly this section restricts the use of culdesacs to appropriate situations and establishes standards for development that utilize culdesac

neckdownsflaresstreet narrowingintersection throating neckdowns are curb extensions at intersections that reduce roadway width curb to curb they are sometimes called slow points nubs bulbouts knuckles or intersection narrowing these traffic control measures reduce the width of a section of roadway in a gradual manner they shorten crossing distances for pedestrians and draw attention to pedestrians via raised peninsulas by tightening curb radii at the corner the pedestrian crossing distance is reduced and the speeds of turning vehicles are reduced the effect of this measure is to reduce speed and discourage nonlocal traffic motorists react to this measure with slower speed because of a concern of a limited travel path roundaboutstraffic circles these are raised circular structures constructed at a threeor fourway intersection their objectives are to slow speeding and reduce the number and severity of vehicular accidents this measure is most suitable for wide intersections and

capacity measured by adopted levels of service loss in the comprehensive plan or in the apfo an apfo accommodates anticipated growth by providing a rational system for expanding improvements while ensuring that the level of growth does not exceed a jurisdictions ability to accommodate it ban apfo differs markedly from exactions and impact fees apfos are regulatory measures that are used to deny development applications or to time and sequence development approval based on availability of infrastructure on an adopted funded and prioritized capital improvements program cip impact fees and exactions are conditions for financing offsite infrastructure attached to development approvals apfos provide the opportunity to enhance certainty in the development approval process with an apfo the applicant and the local government know the standards before applications are filed the apfos provide the opportunity to structure infrastructure mitigation requirements in a flexible manner providing cross access easements a higher degree of street connectivity and mixed uses can be factored into the traffic impact analyses tias to reduce development impact on the roadway network and thus create greater capacity capfos must be reasonable and flexible in order to work efficiently a onesizefitsall los would have the unintended consequence of encouraging sprawl because uncongested roads tend to lie at greenfields at the periphery of the urbanized area this situation is remedied by providing a lower los or an exemption for 1downtowns and mature builtup areas  or 2where the infrastructure network is fixed infill opportunities and alternative transportation modes such as transit and pedestrian access exist dan apfo raises numerous policy issues which by themselves could comprise a separate report a summary of the issues is as follows 1adequate public facilities these include water sewer storm water management police and fire protection solid waste parks and recreation schools and transportation providers should include capital improvement districts utilities and local regional state or federal jurisdictions an apfo transportation los includes roads of the jurisdiction and state and federal highway passing adjacent to the jurisdiction the same is true with an apfo based upon school facilities located in a separate school district 2undesirable effects associated with timing or mitigating new development proposals these must be tempered or mitigated roadsbased apfos could require an unacceptable widening of roads these can be addressed by designating the types of mitigation that will be accepted 3establishing loss these must be established at levels that protect public health safety and welfare while not unreasonably restricting growth infill corridors and downtown areas could be exempt from the apfo in order to encourage development and to recognize the availability of existing facilities 4development approvals an apfo could be triggered at early stages of the development approval process plan amendments rezoning or discretionary decisions this provides developers with knowledge of the requirements of the apfo allowing structuring of proposals before significant expenditures have been committed to a project apfos can also be triggered late in the development approval process this approach more efficiently uses staff and planning commission time because only those projects that will proceed to development are reviewed however it may also produce unanticipated delays in development after the applicant has committed substantial resources to the project 5impact areas defining los for water sewer or piped facilities the impact area consists of the fixed service area for openended facilities where demand is not physically restricted to a geographic area the designation is a policy decision eg roads and parks an intersection or a park can be used by anyone inside or outside a jurisdiction but demand typically declines with distance from the facility apfos either provide a designated distance a demarcation line eg a designated park or traffic influenced areas or a procedure for evaluating demand eg evaluating all street links for which the development creates at least 5% of the roadway impact some road ordinances require a tia only to the first intersection 6existing facilities when determining whether adequate capacity exists we count both existing facilities and those included in the cip most programs count facilities within a third or fourth year of the cip for various reasons eg it takes several years for many developments to become fully occupied thereby creating some lag time between development approval and the demand for facilities  and counting only existing facilities could unreasonably restrict growth 7reservation of capacity  pipeline development when a development is approved and gains vested rights the amount of capacity it utilizes must be debited against available capacity for future projects this pipeline development reservation of capacity must be strictly limited to two to four years where an apfo is tested early in the process the development is still in the formative stages and could fail due to financing problems or a changing market in many communities only a small percentage of rezoning or preliminary plats actually proceed to construction in this event approved projects should be counted toward available capacity only for a three to fouryear window and not a permanent reservation of capacity jurisdictions should implement a development approval tracking system 8application of apfos if the los is not met development of approval can either be denied or the development can be given the option of timing and sequencing the project so that future stages of the proposal are not approved until the facilities are available developers can also be given the option to voluntarily advance capacity development agreement if they wish to proceed at a faster pace
