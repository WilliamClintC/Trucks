neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any speech including sexually oriented speech similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to speech protected by the first amendment and new york constitution or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented speech to their

village of massena are all residents of the village the mayor and members of the board are familiar with the village the locations of sexually oriented businesses in the village and the issues raised by those types of businesses in the village and throughout the country the mayor and board are also cognizant that aids hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases are serious health concerns in the local community based on the mayor and boards local knowledge and evidence concerning the impacts or secondary effects of adult uses on the community as presented in hearings and in reports made available to the board on findings involving the effects of sexually oriented businesses and public nudity incorporated in judicial decisions such as but not limited to town of islip v caviglia 73 ny2d 544 1989  stringfellows of new york ltd v city of new york 91 ny2d 382 1998  city of erie v paps am 146 l ed2d 265 2000  city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986  young v american

minnesota  whittier california  phoenix arizona  indianapolis indiana  austin texas  seattle washington  and tucson arizona  and from manuals and books such as an educational manual on how to regulate

businesses 2000 edition by jules b gerard west group 1999  protecting communities from sexually oriented businesses by len l munsil southwest legal press inc 1996  and also on findings from the report of the attorney  23016 sexually oriented businesses  2331  generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the mayor and board find 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are not properly controlled by the operators of the establishments further there are not adequate legal provisions making the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in or may be requested to engage in sexual behavior as a result of the type of employment in which they are engaged 3 sexual acts including masturbation occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 the entertainment offered at sexually oriented businesses often encourages sexual activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases may be spread by sexual activities including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus hiv aids hepatitis b and venereal diseases 7 aids hiv hepatitis b and venereal diseases are serious health concerns in the local community 8 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to regulate those activities and maintain those facilities 9 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in certain areas of sexually oriented businesses particularly where persons view adult oriented films or adult entertainment 10 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the substantial governmental concerns raised by the various findings herein 11 a licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities  2331 massena code  2331  occurring therein 12 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or participants and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 13 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in assuring that the sexually oriented business is operated appropriately 14 it is desirable in the prevention of illegal activities and the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 15 the fact that an applicant for an adult license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in sexually oriented businesses in which sexual activities often occur 16 the barring of such individuals from association with adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to unwanted sexual activities 17 regulations separating the performers who appear nude or seminude in sexually oriented businesses from the patrons or customers protect the performers reduce the opportunity for illegal activities between performers and patrons or customers and do not interfere with the content of any performance 18 the board has determined that body rubs should only be conducted for compensation by certain licensed professionals or athletic trainers 19 the board further determines that sexual encounter centers as defined herein do not serve a legitimate purpose offer a location at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can readily occur and provide a location at which sexually transmitted diseases may be spread the board thus determines that sexual encounter centers should be prohibited 20 the board further determines that adult hotels or motels as defined herein offer a location at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can readily occur due to the offering of shortterm or hourly rooms with beds and provide a location at which sexually transmitted diseases may be spread the board thus determines that adult hotels or motels should be prohibited 21 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  2331 sexually oriented businesses  2332   2332 definitions as used in this

advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of telecommunication services these new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers this requires that the village regulate these wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances b the federal communications commission has recently licensed a number of providers of wireless communication services and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the village and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers andor structures as well the intent of this proposed regulation is to provide for the establishment andor expansion of wireless telecommunication services within the village while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunications facilities design siting and screening more specifically this regulation has been developed in order to 1 maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the village 2 encourage providers to collocate their facilities on a single tower c the village of massena has undertaken a deliberate process to establish policy standards and procedures related to the siting of tower structure and antenna arrays for wireless telecommunications as contained herein in doing so the municipality attempted to 1 preserve property values and development opportunities 2 minimize the visual impact of towers 3 minimize the number of towers and their heights  27022 telecommunications towers  2731   2732 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings
