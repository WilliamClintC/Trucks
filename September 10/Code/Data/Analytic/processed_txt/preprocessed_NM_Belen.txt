reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there

policy for streets footnotes  2  editors note adopted  amended ch 1020 in its entirety to read as set out herein former ch 1020   pertained to similar subject matter and derived from purpose reducing excessive speeds on residential streets is an important objective in ensuring the safety of pedestrians cyclists animals and vehicles in neighborhoods and in creating a calmer and more livable environment methods for discouraging speeding include enforcement education and engineering efforts while police enforcement remains the most effective means of dealing with speeding limited resources prevent officers from covering all of the problem locations at all times in response to this concern the city of belen has developed this policy which addresses engineering efforts specifically the use of speed humps as a traffic calming technique for retrofit use in existing neighborhoods many drivers ignore statutory and posted speed limits and if the design of the road will allow them to do so will drive at speeds exceeding those which suit the conditions prevailing in residential areas various physical devices have been developed to discourage this behavior  one 1 of these devices is the speed hump    definition of speed humps speed humps are generally three 3 inches high flattopped or cylindrical raised sections of pavement typically twelve 12 to twentytwo 22 feet in length in the direction of travel the ends of a speed hump are tapered to be flush with the street at the curb and gutter to allow water to drain speed humps are spaced roughly two hundred fifty 250 to seven hundred fifty 750 feet apart and have been proven to work by creating a vertical displacement of the vehicles traversing them it should be noted that speed humps are not the typical speed bump frequently seen in parking lots installation of speed humps must strictly adhere to approved designs a typical flattopprofile speed hump design is shown in figure 1 flattop speed humps have been used successfully to diminish speeds on roads with high volumes a typical cylindrical or watts profile speed hump design is shown in figure 2 watts profile speed humps are generally limited for use on roadways with volumes no greater than three thousand 3000 vehicles per day vpd in addition advance warning signs must always be used in conjunction with speed humps  appropriate signing for flattop speed humps is shown in figure 1 while the typical signing for the watts profile humps is shown in figure 2    engineering criteria a alternative traffic management strategies should always be pursued before the decision is made to install speed humps these strategies include 1 reviewing establishing andor revising and enforcing general laws and ordinances pertaining to speed limits and other traffic control management items  2 educating residents and neighborhood groups so they can better understand causes of traffic problems potential solutions to these problems and the advantages and disadvantages of implementing different solutions  3 installing specific regulatory warning and guide message signs or other traffic control devices speed humps are an effective and appropriate device for safely reducing vehicle speeds on certain types of streets when all of these other speed control alternatives have been investigated and determined to be ineffective in order for speed hump installations to be effective they should be located selectively in accordance with defined transportation engineering criteria proper installation will also minimize driver frustration and encourage safe driving practices b if a location fails to meet any of the following criteria the placement of speed humps should not be recommended 1 operational criteria a the functional classification of the roadway is a local or major local street b average weekly daily traffic awdt volumes on the roadway segment are less than three thousand 3000 vpd c the posted speed limit of the roadway segment is twentyfive 25 miles per hour mph or less d the eightyfifth percentile speed measured on the roadway segment exceeds the posted speed limit by ten 10 mph or more this criterion may be waived for deadend streets 2 the roadway segment is fronted by primarily more than fifty 50 percent residential land uses 3 geometric criteria a the roadway has a vertical grade of eight 8 percent or less b the roadway segment is paved c the roadway segment has only one 1 moving lane of traffic in each direction d the section length is greater than or equal to two 2 blocks or one thousand two hundred 1200 feet e the width of the street is greater than eighteen 18 feet c the following general conditions should also be considered when installing speed humps 1 motorists should have adequate sight distance to react to speed humps 2 speed humps should not be placed over manholes gate valves utility vault accesses or other similar features 3 if a drainage inlet is near where a speed hump would be placed according to the general spacing criteria an attempt should be made to locate the hump just downstream of the inlet 4 speed humps should be placed to take advantage of existing street lighting 5 speed humps should not be placed in front of driveways 6 speed humps should be placed at property lines if possible rather than directly in front of a residence 7 speed humps are placed perpendicular to the

nmsa 1978 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the governing body of the city of belen new mexico does ordain as follows 1   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of belen are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 2   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 3   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 4 article ii  definitions   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be
