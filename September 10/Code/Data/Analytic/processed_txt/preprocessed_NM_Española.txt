findings and intent the city council finds and states its intent as follows a it is the intent of the council in enacting this article to improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city and to protect the safety of the general public against certain abusive conduct of persons engaged in panhandling by imposing reasonable time place and manner restrictions on panhandling while respecting the constitutional rights of all citizens b an increase in aggressive panhandling throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder among the general population c aggressive panhandling usually includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact andor the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and such other conduct as identified and regulated in this article aggressive panhandling has directly led to extreme violence and harm to citizens in espaola d the presence of panhandlers soliciting money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous motorists also find themselves confronted by persons who without permission wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so such activity often carries with it an implicit threat of harm to motorists passengers and their property people driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with panhandlers seeking money by offering to perform services such as opening car doors or locating or holding parking spaces such facetoface solicitation presents risks of duress and is a particularly intrusive and disruptive form of communication and is therefore appropriately regulated by this article the restrictions on panhandling in this article are for times and at places where citizens are more likely to be vulnerable to harassment and intimidation  2721 general provisions  2722   2723 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning aggressive panhandling  aggressive panhandling occurs only when the panhandler e many panhandlers are in fact not homeless but instead are confidence operators who prey on the elderly tourists and others who are uncertain about the genuine needs of the panhandler f the solicitation of people in places where they are a captive audience in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen or to avoid solicitation from panhandlers is abusive and dangerous such places include public transportation vehicles public transportation termination points and points of entry to and exit from public transportation indoor and outdoor dining areas parking lots and structures and those places where people are standing in line to enter a commercial or public facility restricting panhandling in such places will provide a balance between the rights of panhandlers and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid the panhandling and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations and provide for the safety and security of the commuting public tourists and those citizens wishing to use public places and commercial facilities g the panhandling prohibited by this article constitutes a nuisance that deprives the citizens of the city of an acceptable environment in which they may live h the city does not seek to discourage street performances to the extent that they do not interfere with the reasonable expectation of residents and businesses to the enjoyment of peace and quiet in their homes and businesses or pose a safety risk to the public and passersby this article seeks to balance the interests of the street performers with those of the other residents and the businesses within the city i this article is timely and appropriate because current laws and city ordinances are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest in enacting this article the council recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives that may be appropriate remedies for violations of this article the goal of this article is to protect citizens from the fear harassment and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling that have become an unwelcome

numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the public health services national toxicology program ntp has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen b secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to children elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease c according to the united states surgeon generals report on the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke issued  there is no riskfree level of exposure to secondhand smoke the united states surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke d given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments ashrae has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure and recommends that indoor environments be smokefree in their entirety e based on the accumulation of sound scientific data the smoking of tobacco must be considered a serious danger to public health a form of air pollution and a material public nuisance f accordingly the espaola city council finds and declares that the proposes of this article are to 1 protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment  and  2787 general provisions  2788
