illuminated for safety and nighttime use h standards specific to south hartmann drive 1 purpose south hartmann drive is the primary northsouth arterial serving travelers on the west side of the city of lebanon the purpose of the south hartmann drive access management plan is to allow access to land development in a manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the transportation system promotes economic development and protects environmental resources along south hartmann drive between interstate 40 i40 and w main street in the city of lebanon 2 general the access management plan includes guidelines and standards where the intent is either advisory guidelines or mandatory standards a guidelines provide direction on more subjective or qualitative objectives such as the location of new streets and the spacing of traffic signals b guidelines are open to interpretation and admit a variety of solutions that support the general intent of the access management plan they are expressed with terms like should and encouraged c standards are specific development and design controls that govern quantitative and measurable objectives such as the location and spacing of driveways they are expressed with terms like shall and must and are often described in tables and d diagrams that show precise dimensions or fixed limits within which a proposed design must fall many guidelines and standards are dependent upon site specific conditions including topography property lines prior site development and sight distances that may prevent the strict application of the guidelines and standards in such cases the city of lebanon engineering department will evaluate the options and determine the appropriate application of the guideline or standard in question the following access management guidelines and standards apply to all properties abutting and street intersections along south hartmann drive between i40 and w main street in the city of lebanon 3 street network providing combined arterial and collector street spacing at closer intervals improves access opportunities reduces traffic where streets meet and allows for reduced cross sections although northsouth street connectivity in the corridor area is generally sufficient with approximately  mile spacing of arterials and collectors eastwest connectivity is poor particularly between hickory ridge road and leeville pike  852 a street spacing the minimum of combined arterial and collector spacing should be  mile accordingly spacing of arterials and collectors at multiples of adopted signal spacing see below signalized intersection spacing will facilitate arterialtoarterial and arterialtocollector intersections a new collector road should be constructed between hickory ridge road and leeville pike to improve eastwest connectivity and provide the recommended  mile arterialcollector spacing b sidewalks for all new developments abutting a collector or arterial street onsite sidewalk installation will be required a continuous allweather sidewalk constructed to a minimum of five feet shall run parallel to the roadway at the front of the parcel a buffer zone of 24 inches must separate the sidewalk from the edge of pavement allowing for an appropriate buffer from vehicular and bicycle traffic as well as future sidewalk connections to adjacent parcels when built new sidewalks shall comply with the standards of the city government  however a design compatible with existing conditions may be considered and approved by the city engineering department upon the advice of the appropriate city government agencies provided constructing such design would cost no more than would full compliance with public sidewalk standards c auxiliary lanes right turn deceleration lanes are required when the outside lane has an expected volume of greater than 250 mph and the right turn volume is greater than 55 mph left turn deceleration lanes are required at all median openings where left turns are expected to occur deceleration lanes shall be designed in accordance with city and tdot standards with left turn and right turn storage lengths determined traffic analysis 4 traffic signal systems long and uniform spacing of traffic signals allows for coordinated signals that reduce delays and improve safety currently there are six signalized intersections on the study segment of south hartmann drive including the northern limit at w main street with an average signal spacing of 046 miles the shortest signalized intersection spacing within the study limits is 020 miles approximately 1050 feet between franklin road and the shopping center entrancefuture crowell lane a signal spacing i ideally traffic signals should be spaced  mile apart for efficient signal progression at speeds of 30 mph to 45 mph maximizing flow rates while minimizing fuel consumption and emissions distances between signals should not vary by more than 10% in order that good progression of traffic may be maintained in both directions ii  mile spacing of signalized intersections typically allows efficient traffic progression at speeds of 40 mph using a common 90 second cycle length in offpeak conditions a shorter cycle may allow efficient progression at higher  853 speeds while in peak periods a longer cycle up to 120 seconds may be used for 30 mph progression table 2 shows optimal signal spacing for efficient progression at various speedscycle lengths table 2 optimum signal spacing for efficient progression at various speedscycle lengths trb 1996 5 unsignalized access unsignalized street and driveway connections introduce conflicts and friction into the traffic stream as vehicles enter and leave traffic lanes the 28 existing access points on south hartmann drive between i40 and west main street or approximately 11 access points per mile plus future connections will present both operational and safety issues a number of driveways the maximum number of driveways is established in table 3 table 3 maximum number of driveways lot frontage number of driveways up to 150 feet 1 150 feet to 299 feet 2 each additional 300 feet 1 b unsignalized street and driveway spacing the minimum spacing for unsignalized streets and driveways shall be as shown in table 4 the required spacing between unsignalized street andor commercial driveways is based on the minimum separation of driveways to reduce crash potential due to rightturn conflict overlap each driveway presents the driver with a minimum of two conflict points as they must be alert for a rightturning vehicle entering mainline traffic or a vehicle making a rightturn into a driveway the recommended spacing requires each driver to monitor a single driveway at a time improving safety and traffic operations all driveways serving properties other than singlefamilyduplex residential or farming are considered commercial spacing between driveways is measured from near edge to near edge of adjacent driveways  854 table 4 minimum connection spacing connection distance feet  unsignalized street and commercial 350 noncommercial driveway 50 the city engineering department may allow two oneway driveways to serve a commercial property distances between adjacent oneway commercial driveways with inbound traffic upstream from the outbound drive must have a minimum separation distance of 25 feet islands having a minimum length of 25 feet measured parallel to the highway must be built between the closely spaced driveways to form definite entrances and exits c joint access and cross access joint and cross access are methods of allowing adjacent properties to share driveways and parking facilities joint access is where two adjacent property owners share a driveway along their common property line cross access is where traffic moves between adjacent properties without reentering the public roadway if an access applicant is unable to comply with the driveway spacing standards listed above the applicant must attempt to obtain an access or mutual driveway easement from the adjacent property as to allow for one egress to serve two properties if located all or partially on the applicants property then the adjacent property owners must agree to relocate any existing access to the proposed access and the relocation must be performed in conjunction with the applicants development of the property if the applicant is unable to obtain an access or mutual driveway easement from an adjacent property owner then the access of the applicants property shall be located on its own property in an area acceptable to the city engineering department d corner clearance important considerations in the safety and operation of intersections are the concepts of functional intersection area and corner clearance corner clearance is minimum distance required between an intersection and an upstream or downstream driveway extending beyond the physical area of the intersection to include the portions of the roadway that are influenced by the intersection figure 1 upstream from the intersection the corner clearance provides room for vehicles to navigate the intersection including turn lanes and queues downstream the functional distance extends from the far side of the intersection to provide guidance and tracking to vehicles passing or turning from the intersection the purpose of corner clearance is to physically separate the functional area of an intersection from the conflicting movements in the area of influence of an adjacent driveway and provide sufficient stacking space for  855 queued vehicles at the intersection so that the driveway is not obstructed by traffic backed up from the intersection figure 1 functional intersection area transportation research board 2003 corner clearance is measured like driveway separation from the closest edge of the driveway connection to the closest edge of the parallel roadway unless an exception is granted the minimum corner clearance for driveways on all four legs of an intersection will be established by an intersection queuing analysis or 200 feet whichever is larger and applicable exceptions may be approved if as a result of the access management standards the property would become landlocked if an exception to the minimum corner clearance is requested and approved the access will be rightinrightout only and under no circumstances will any part of a driveway be permitted to connect with either the major street or intersecting side street within 50 feet from the near edge of the adjacent street e throat length distances the connection depth of a driveway throat length as measured from the edge of the abutting roadway to the near edge of the internal circulation road or buffer area shall be of sufficient length to allow a driver to enter the site without interfering with the mainline of traffic figure 2 table 5 shows the minimum throat lengths based on the site activities city staff will assist the applicant in determining the appropriate site activity category  856 table 5 minimum throat length site activity throat lengths feet  regional

throat length source txdot 6 medians median treatments are one of the most effective ways to regulate access and reduce crashes national cooperative highway research program nchrp report 420 impacts of access management techniques found that raised medians reduce crashes by over 40 percent in urban areas and over 60 percent in rural areas based on crash data in seven states in the divided portion of south hartmann drive northbound and southbound traffic are separated by two foot inside shoulders and a fourteen 14 foot wide raised median consisting of concrete curb surrounding a grass plot concrete on the bartons creek bridge there are median openings at intersecting roadways existing access points to adjacent properties and planned future access points the median openings are flush pavement which continues as a striped flush median on either side of the intersecting roadway or driveway to the start of the left turn lanes if applicable with an average distance of approximately 400 feet between a given access point and resumption of the raised median  857 a median opening spacing the unsignalized median opening functions as an intersection median openings should be designed with auxiliary lanes that allow left turning vehicles to decelerate without interfering with the of the leftmost lane full median openings shall be spaced a minimum of 1320 feet apart appropriately spaced median openings have already been constructed on the portion of south hartmann drive within the study area and no additional full median openings should be considered  858  building design a

impervious cover because of the citys history with flooding to help limit the creation of unused parking areas alternative parking solutions may be considered by the planning commission the bases for an alternative parking solution could be but is not limited to 1 parking demand on similar type developments 2 availability of shared parking facilities 3 availability of reasonable pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure 4 proximity of mass transit ie music city star stations 5 a general parking study 6 a site specific parking study 7 the level of risk for a negative impact on the normal flow of traffic if the number of parking spaces is not adequate 8 the availability of an area where parking could be expanded if the demand increased note in all cases the number of required parking spaces

guidelines are adopted by the lebanon historic preservation commission for the preservation and rehabilitation of structures within the city of lebanon tennessee included within such historic districts as shall be created by the city of lebanon tennessee the design guidelines set forth in this appendix of the city of lebanon zoning are referred to collectively as the historic preservation design guidelines or the design guidelines the purpose of the design guidelines is to maintain the historic character of significant neighborhoods within the city of lebanon a to guide the expansion and renovation of historic structures and the construction of new buildings within designated districts or landmarked structures  and b to permit rehabilitation and new development where appropriate while preserving and enhancing lebanons character  and c to assist the city in reviewing proposals to maintain historic structures 2 applicability 1 standards within this appendix include both residential and nonresidential guidelines and shall apply to properties within the city of lebanons historic preservation districts as stated below a residential guidelines i greenlawn historic preservation district ii east spring historic preservation district iii cumberland university historic preservation district 2 applicability of other articles a where a historic district overlays a zoning district with its own design standards found in both the design guidelines and design standards shall apply with the design guidelines taking precedence during any conflict 3 economic hardship the historic preservation commission hpc can take into consideration economic hardship arguments of the applicant in its determination the hpc would consider that by reason of the exceptional deterioration of the structure or by reason of the particular  f6 economics of the proposed project the strict application of the design guidelines would result in peculiar and practical difficulties or undue economic hardship upon the owner to develop the property the hpc would also consider whether the relief of the particular hardships would not establish substantial detriment to the public good or substantially impair the intent and purpose of the historic preservation peculiar hardship would apply to the particular land or building regardless of the owner and the peculiar hardship is not created as a result of an act upon the part of the applicant if a certificate of appropriateness coa is denied to a property owner the hpc will consider economic hardship and other factors that may affect an owners ability to undertake and complete rehabilitation or other work considered economic hardship caused by unusual and compelling circumstances is based on one or more of the following the property cannot reasonably be maintained in the manner dictated by the ordinance  there are no other reasonable means of saving the property from deterioration or collapse or  the property is owned by a nonprofit organization and it is not feasible financially or physically to achieve the charitable purposes of the organization while maintaining the property appropriately economic hardship criteria economic hardship is a finding made by the historic preservation commission when the denial of a certificate of appropriateness will 1 deprive the owner of the property of all reasonable use of or economic return on the property or 2 place an unreasonable economic burden on the property owner commensurate with the owners financial ability to meet the requirements of the coa the hpc shall apply the following criteria a the basis to establish economic hardship for an incomeproducing property shall be that a reasonable rate of return cannot be obtained from a property that retains its historic features or structures in either its present condition or if its features or structures are rehabilitated b economic hardship in regard to a nonincomeproducing property shall be found when the property owner demonstrates that the property has no beneficial use as a singlefamily dwelling or for an institutional use in its present condition or if rehabilitated c demonstration of an economic hardship shall not be based on or include any of the following circumstances  f7 1 willful or negligent acts by the owner 2 purchase of the property for substantially more than market value 3 failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs 4 failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants 5 failure to provide normal tenant improvements to make a determination of economic hardship the hpc can request the following information in order to make its decision a cost estimates of the proposed construction alteration demolition or removal and an estimate of the additional costs that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the hpc for issuance of a coa b a report from a licensed engineer or architect with expertise in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation c estimated market value of the property in its current condition  estimated market value after completion of the proposed construction alteration demolition or removal  after any change recommended by the hpc  and in the case of a proposed demolition after renovation of the existing property for continued use d in the case of a proposed demolition an estimate from an architect developer real estate consultant appraiser or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property and its market value for continued use after rehabilitation e for incomeproducing properties information on annual gross income operating and maintenance expenses depreciation deductions and annual cash flow after debt service current property value appraisals assessed property valuations real estate taxes and any other information considered necessary by the hpc for determine whether substantial evidence of economic hardship exists f remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service if any for the previous two years g all appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase financing or ownership of the property h amount paid for the property the date of purchase and the party from whom purchased approval of economic hardship shall be based on the following criteria a denial of the coa will diminish the value of the subject property so as to leave substantially no value b sale or rental of the property is impractical when compared to the cost of holding such property for uses permitted in this zone c an adaptive reuse study has been conducted and found that utilization of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or impractical d rental at a reasonable rate of return is not feasible  f8 e denial of the coa would damage the owner of the property unreasonably in comparison to the benefit conferred to the community f all means of involving city sponsored incentives such as financial assistance building code modifications loans grants etc have been explored to relieve possible economic disincentives  f9 4 design guidelines for residential buildings the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation introduction to the standards the secretary of the interior is responsible for establishing standards for all programs under departmental authority and for advising federal agencies on the preservation of historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the national register of historic places the standards for rehabilitation codified in 36 cfr 67 for use in the federal historic preservation tax incentives program addresses the most prevalent treatment rehabilitation is defined as the process of returning a property to a state of utility or alteration which makes possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving those portions and features of the property which are significant to its historic architectural and cultural values initially developed by the secretary of interior to determine the appropriateness of proposed project work on registered properties within the historic preservation fund grantinaid program the standards for rehabilitation have been widely used over the yearsparticularly to determine if rehabilitation qualifies as certified rehabilitation for federal tax purposes in addition the standards have guided federal agencies in carrying out their historic preservation responsibilities for properties in federal ownership or control  and state and local officials in reviewing both federal and nonfederal rehabilitation proposals they have also been adopted by historic district and planning commissions across the country the intent of the standards is to assist the longterm preservation of a propertys significance preservation of historic materials and features the standards pertain to historic buildings of all materials construction types sizes and occupancy and encompass the exterior and interior of the buildings they also encompass related landscape features and the buildings site and environment as well as attached adjacent or related new construction to be certified for federal tax purposes a rehabilitation project must be determined by the secretary to be consistent with the historic character of the structures and where applicable the district in which it is located as stated in the definition the treatment rehabilitation assumes that at least some repair or alteration of the historic building will be needed in order to provide for an efficient contemporary use  however these repairs and alterations must not damage or destroy materials features or finishes that are important in defining the buildings historic character for example certain treatments  if improperly applied  may cause or accelerate physical deterioration of the historic building this can include using improper repointing or exterior masonry cleaning techniques or introducing insulation that damages historic fabric in almost all of these situations  f10 use of these materials and treatments will result in a project that does not meet the standards similarly exterior additions that duplicate the form material and detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the structure will fail to meet the standards the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the standards department of interior regulations 36 cfr 67 pertain to historic buildings of all materials construction types sizes and occupancy and encompass the exterior and the interior related landscape features and the buildings site and environment as well as attached adjacent or related new construction the standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility 1 a property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment 2 the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved the removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided 3 each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historic development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken 4 most properties change over time  those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved 5 distinctive features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterized a property shall be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old in design color texture and other visual qualities and where possible materials replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence 7 chemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible 8 significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation measures shall be undertaken 9 new additions exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing size scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment  f11 10 new addition and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired 42 alterations to existing buildings and property  definition a change in building material  the addition or elimination of any architectural feature or a structure  a repair that reconstructs any part of an existing building  an addition that extends or increases floor area or height of any building  or construction of an appurtenance  general principles these guidelines shall apply only to the exteriors of buildings and to areas of lots clearly visible from public rightsofway proposals for exterior work to be done on public faades  front and streetrelated elevations  shall be more carefully reviewed than to be done on other faades nonpublic faades shall mean those faades not visible from the street every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property requiring minimal alteration of the building structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its originally intended purpose adam the distinguishing original qualities or character of a building structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed the removal or significant alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building structure or site and its  f12 environment these changes may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced when economically feasible in the event that replacement is necessary the new material should match the material being replaced in composition design color texture and other visual qualities repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures it is important to note the presence of different architectural styles from the 1820s to present although such elements as roof windows doors porch etc may be common to all each period possesses distinctive details and features that distinguish it from other periods the integrity of each period should be maintained in the repairreplacement or addition to these details and features the surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage historic building materials shall not be undertaken tudor contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical architectural or cultural material  and when such design is compatible with the size scale color material and character of the property neighborhood and environment whenever possible new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in  f13 the future the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired  additions additions are areas that increase the living or working space of a structure this does not include the addition of architectural elements whenever feasible an addition should be situated at the rear of a building in such a way that it will not disturb either front or side public faades additions should follow the guidelines for new construction bungalow folk victorian  architectural feature all practical efforts should be employed to retain the original features the replacement of irreparable features should be with close visual approximations of the originals  f14 the replacement of missing original features should be based on accurate duplication or should be close visual approximations of the originals based on historic physical or pictorial documentation architectural features of any period or style not original to the building should not be introduced if artificial siding materials are used soffits eaves and porch ceilings should not be concealed and the material should replicate the original feature  materials original building materials include wood brick stone terra cotta and stucco original roof materials include slate metal wood shingles and on twentieth century buildings asphalt shingles original building and roofing materials should be retained if replacement is necessary it should be with original materials whenever economically feasible or with close visual approximations of the original in both color and content 1 masonry masonry repointing should be done with care to match the original mortar color the use of portland cement should be avoided when repointing old brick original tooling configuration and joint width should be maintained  f15 cleaning should be done with the gentlest means possible sandblasting causes severe damage to brick and mortar  its use should be avoided stone terra cotta limestone tile and glass should not be tinted or painted unless it was a characteristic of the original design 2 wood wood siding should be retained if possible but vinyl siding may be used provided the width of the vinyl siding matches the width of the wooden siding which is being covered and replicates a visual representation of the original vinyl siding should be smoothsurfaced and not woodtextured replacement wood siding should be consistent with the original in size direction and lap dimension decorative elements should never be covered by or removed in favor of artificial siding applications original wall shingles should be maintained  color the lebanon historic preservation commission does not review and regulate paint colors on historic structures note paint colors original to the building are generally the most acceptable if this is not possible or desirable an appropriate substitute should be made appropriate paint colors vary according to the age of the building and guidance for selecting appropriate colors can be provided by the lebanon historic preservation commission  roofs original roof pitch configuration and architectural features should be maintained the original size and shape of dormers should be maintained dormers generally should not be introduced where none existed originally  f16 original roof materials should be retained if replacement is necessary original materials should be used which are a close visual approximation of the original in both color and content when it is not economically feasible to replace or repair with original materials or when the original roof is beyond repair nonoriginal materials of a similar color and content which are appropriate to the architectural style and period of the house may be used guidance for selecting appropriate nonoriginal materials can be provided by the lebanon historic preservation commission skylights should be located so as to not be clearly visible from public rightsof way note roof architectural features may include but are not limited to overhangs cornices rafters cresting gutter systems brackets finials pendants vents and chimneys  porches original architectural features and shape  outline roof height and roof pitch  should be retained original porch materials and architectural features should be maintained if different materials are substituted they should be a close visual approximation of the original the enclosing of side porches may be considered appropriate if the general visual character of the original porch is maintained for example this would include preservation of existing columns or pillars so as not to change the rhythm of the space note porch architectural features may include columns railings balustrades brackets friezes ceilings floors and steps craftsman  f17  doors the original size shape and architectural features of door openings should be maintained original transoms side lights and doors should be maintained replacement doors should be compatible with original doors in terms of style and material flush doors are generally inappropriate original or originalstyle screen doors are appropriate shiny raw

and architectural features of windows should be maintained the original number and arrangement of panes should be maintained in general storm windows and screens are not appropriate however storm windows of appropriate style and color to match the sash color and original window style may be employed shutters when appropriate to the style of the building are acceptable shutters should fit an opening in height and width so that if they were closed the opening would be covered new window openings should not be introduced unless they match the existing window configuration and their placement harmonizes with the existing rhythm of openings original windows should not be filled in note window architectural features may include sash trim aprons number and configuration of lights hoods and lintels  landscaping all aspects of site development should be sympathetic to the character of the overall neighborhood landscape development architectural structures fountains ponds etc artistic lawn objects and the types of plants and their spatial treatment of adjacent properties should be appropriate if it becomes necessary in the event of storm damage safety hazards or disease to prune or cut any trees lining the public rights of way every effort should be made to maintain the natural symmetry of the tree the practice of topping of trees is not appropriate and should never be employed for trees which are clearly visible from public rightsofway  lighting original exterior light fixtures should be retained if possible o if replaced the style should be appropriate to the architectural style of the building freestanding lampposts in yards should be in keeping with the architectural style of the house and neighborhood  f20 landscape andor general residential faade

restrictions  public spaces landscaping signage lighting street furniture and other work undertaken in public spaces by any individual group agency or municipality shall be presented to the lebanon historic preservation commission for review for compatibility and appropriateness for the historic district  appurtenances appurtenances related to a building fences walls street lamps steps paving sidewalks and signs should be visually compatible with the environment to which they are related  f21 1 fences low retaining walls in front yards should be kept where they exist introduction of retaining walls where none existed should be avoided if feasible however if introduced the retaining walls should be visually conducive to the natural landscape of the property historic stacked walls should be maintained in their natural state mortar pointing at stress points and in areas of retaining is appropriate new stacked stone or brick walls which are similar to historic walls in the district are perfectly acceptable and encouraged new or reclaimed lower height iron fencing may be appropriate for properties with pre1900 houses iron fencing is generally not appropriate for later houses low woodpicket fences of a style and color which is compatible to the residence are appropriate in front of rear yards decorative board fences usually taller with wider boards set close together for privacy may be appropriate around the rear yards if they are of a style texture and color to match the property in general decorative board fences designed for privacy should not extend beyond the back yard area chain link vinyl metalliclike or woven fences are inappropriate for front or visible side yards they may be used in rear yards if a portion of a rear fence is visible from the street it must be camouflaged with hedge vine or appropriate landscaping high solid walls are inappropriate for a residential district appropriate fences wrought iron picket  f22 2 gates gate entrances should be appropriate in scale relative to the overall entrance and the adjoining fencewall pillars and be in keeping with the architectural style of the house solid gates should be avoided if directly affronting the street 3 street lights paving and parking lighting at the street level should be in keeping with the architectural style of the house and be incorporated for a specific design function  example driveway entrance gate entrance etc in principle driveways paving steps etc should be sympathetic to the character of landscape development of the property in general and harmonious with neighborhood aesthetics parking areas which are clearly visible from public rightsofway should be balanced in area relative to the size of the building and overall area of the property in general appropriate landscaping and paving design should be employed in order to minimize the visual appearance of any parking area no type of vehicle used predominately for a recreational utility or commercial purpose should be parked in such a manner as to be clearly visible from public rightsofway 4 mailboxes mailboxes should reflect the character of the existing house surrounding buildings andor general landscape aesthetics mailboxes of a novelty design are not permitted wall mounted mailboxes where they have historically existed shall be maintained in lieu of rightofway boxes mailboxes shall not be permitted in or closely adjacent to public rightsofway  eg future sidewalks within the lebanon historic districts 5 recreational facilities in general all recreation equipment devices and facilities  eg ball goals swimming pools tennis courts etc should be located on the property as to not be visible from public rightof8 72020 f23 way and must be an appropriate distance with proper landscaping as to minimize intrusion with adjacent properties 43 new construction  definition the construction of any freestanding structure on any lot or addition to existing structure  general principles the guidelines shall apply only to the exteriors of buildings and predominately to areas of lots clearly visible from public rightsofway the public faades  front and streetrelated elevations  of proposals for new buildings shall be more carefully reviewed than other faades in considering applications for new construction the commission shall take into account the variety and architectural style present within the district new buildings which are design compatible and complement existing structures in both size and architecture are encouraged provided they are proposed as either new infill or additions new construction generally should not displace existing historic district primary structures reconstruction may be appropriate when it reproduces faades of a building which no longer exists and which was located in the historic district if the building would have contributed to the historical and architectural character of the area  if it will be compatible in terms of style height scale massing and materials with the buildings immediately surrounding the lot on which the reproduction will be built  and if it is accurately based on pictorial documentation because new buildings usually relate to an established pattern and rhythm of existing buildings both on the same and opposite sides of a street the dominance of that pattern and rhythm must be respected and not disrupted new construction should be consistent with existing buildings along a street in terms of height scale setback and rhythm  relationship of materials texture details and color  roof shape  orientation  and proportion and rhythm of openings in the case of planned new construction between two buildings of equal height of varying heights an individual judgment will be made by the lebanon historic preservation commission as to compatibility of the design  f24 historically residential districts were designed as singlefamily residences of solid permanent construction and remain so today accordingly all new construction additions or relocation of any structures within or to a historic district shall be of permanent construction and employed solely as singlefamily residences  guidelines for new construction 1 height new buildings must be construed to the same number of stories and to a height which is compatible with the height of adjacent buildings the relationship between windows and wall areas should be compatible with that found on historic buildings the height of new structures should be compatible with those of neighboring historic buildings and the surrounding context generally new buildings should not be taller than adjacent structures 2 scale the size of a new building  its mass in relation to open spaces  and its windows doors openings and porches should be visually compatible with the surrounding buildings 3 setback and rhythm of spacing the setback from front and side yard property lines established by adjacent buildings must be maintained when a definite rhythm along a street is established infill new buildings should maintain the rhythm  f25 maintain the original historic line of the building setback maintaining a continuous street frontage is one of the most important elements in prompting pedestrian activity and establishing a quality face to the public realm  4 roof shape the roofs of new buildings shall be visually compatible by not contrasting greatly with the roof shape and orientation of surrounding buildings 5 proportion and rhythm of openings the relationship of width to height of windows and doors and the rhythm of solids to voids in new buildings shall be visually compatible with surrounding buildings 6 relationship of materials texture details and material color the relationship and use of materials texture details and material color of a new buildings public faades shall be visually compatible with and similar to those of adjacent buildings or shall not contrast conspicuously 7 orientation the site orientation of new buildings shall be consistent with that of adjacent buildings and shall be visually compatible directional expression shall be compatible with surrounding buildings whether that expression is vertical horizontal or nondirectional 8 additions to existing buildings  f26 new additions to existing buildings should be kept to a minimum and should be compatible in scale materials and texture  additions should not be visually jarring or contrasting additions to the front of a building should be consistent with the architectural style of the existing structure additions may be located to the rear of existing buildings in ways which do not disturb the public faades the creation of an addition of a front faade porch is inappropriate and should be avoided 9 outbuildings garages and storage buildings should reflect the character of the existing house and surrounding buildings and should be compatible in terms of height scale roof shape materials texture and details if vinyl siding is used it should be compatible to the architectural style of the house no metal or vinyl storage buildings garages or carports are allowed garages if clearly visible from the street should be situated on the lot as historically traditional for the neighborhood the location and design of outbuildings should not be visually disruptive to the character of the surrounding buildings 10 appurtenances appurtenances related to new buildings including driveways sidewalks lighting fences and walls shall be visually compatible with the environment of the existing buildings and sites to which they relate satellite dishes must be located in rear yards satellite dishes antennas and other signalreceiving devices shall not be erected in clearly visible primary or secondary faades buildings on corner lots shall not have these devices erected in the side yard adjacent to the street dish antennas should be of minimum size relative to standard technology and not be visible from any public rightsofway they should also be screened landscaping not fences in order to minimize viewing from adjacent properties no advertising should appear on the dish 44 relocation  f27  definition the moving of a building in a district from one site to another  general principles the moving of an existing building which retains architectural and historical integrity and which contributed to the architectural and historical character of the district should be avoided the moving out of the district of a building which does not contribute to the historical and architectural integrity to the district or which has lost architectural integrity due to deterioration and neglect shall be appropriate if its removal or the proposal for its replacement will result in a more positive appropriate visual effect on the district  guidelines for relocation relocated buildings must be carefully rebuilt to retain and maintain original architectural details and materials a building may be moved into the district if it maintains a sense of architectural unity in terms of style height scale massing materials texture and setback with existing buildings along the street a building may be moved from one site to another in the district if  the integrity of location and setting of the building in its original location has been lost or is seriously threatened   the new location will be similar in setting and site   the building will be compatible with the buildings adjacent to the new location in style height scale materials and setback  and  the relocation of the building will not result in a negative visual effect on the site and surrounding buildings from which it will be removed 45 demolition  definition the tearing down of a building  general principles since the purpose of historic zoning is to protect historic properties the demolition of a building which contributes historically or architecturally to the character and significance of the district is inappropriate and should be avoided  guidelines  f28 1 demolition is inappropriate  if a building is of such architectural or historical interest and value that its removal would be detrimental to the public interest   if a building is of such old or unusual or uncommon design and materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced without great difficulty and expense  or  if its proposed replacement would make a less positive visual contribution to the district or would be visually incompatible 2 demolition is appropriate  if a building has lost its architectural and historical integrity and importance and its removal will not result in a more negative less appropriate visual effect on the district   if a building does not contribute to the historical or architectural character and importance of the district and its removal will result in a more positive appropriate visual effect on the district  f29 5 design guidelines for nonresidential buildings the secretary of interiors standards for rehabilitation are as follows 1 a property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment 2 the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved the removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided 3 each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken 4 most properties change over time  those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved 5 distinctive features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old in design color texture and other visual qualities and where possible materials replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence 7 chemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken in the gentlest means possible 8 significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation measures shall be undertaken 9 new additions exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing size scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment 10new additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future the essential form nonresidential guidelines approach and format of primary importance in the approach of design guidelines is the emphasis on preservation over replacement the frequent use of terms such as retain maintain and preserve demonstrates this emphasis historic buildings landscapes and components should be preserved and wellmaintained if they become damaged they should be repaired if the damage is too severe for repair the minimal area necessary should be replaced using materials and designs that match the historic appearance contemporary materials may be used if they possess characteristics similar in scale design finish  f30 texture durability and detailing to historic materials and meet the secretary of the interiors standards exterior insulation finish systems eifs and vinyl are not appropriate exterior materials following are design guidelines for nonresidential properties they are grouped to cover historic building components landscape components infill construction building relocation and building demolition illustrations are included to help provide clarity and terms are defined in the appendices the guidelines emphasize the public parts of buildings and settings defined as those visible from the public rightofway building front elevations or faades often contain the elements that define a buildings style and these elements should remain visible and unaltered for commercial buildings the distinctive combination of lower storefront and upper faade found on the primary elevation also illustrates the buildings function if changes are desired they should be situated behind buildings and out of public view property owners and managers are encouraged to refer to the guidelines when undertaking construction rehabilitation or everyday maintenance in reference to general routine property maintenance and inkind repairs within the historic preservation overlay the design and materials should be appropriate to the age of the building they support repair and replacement inkind does not require a certificate of appropriateness but all work must match the existing architecture design and elements owners planning work on existing structures should contact the city of lebanon planning department before beginning work to ensure that a coa is not required all other construction activities are required to be reviewed by the historic zoning commission and all of the guideline references will be applied as necessary for the principle of the construction project new construction infill alterations or additions 51 rehabilitation a essential principles for rehabilitation i a property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials features

other official regulations the most restrictive standard shall apply i south hartmann drive access management plan 1 purpose south hartmann drive is the primary northsouth arterial serving travelers on the west side of the city of lebanon the purpose of the south hartmann drive access management plan is to allow access to land development in a manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the transportation system promotes economic development and protects city of lebanon subdivision regulations  of 81 environmental resources along south hartmann drive between interstate 40 i40 and w main street in the city of lebanon 2 general the access management plan includes guidelines and standards where the intent is either advisory guidelines or mandatory standards i guidelines provide direction on more subjective or qualitative objectives such as the location of new streets and the spacing of traffic signals guidelines are open to interpretation and admit a variety of solutions that support the general intent of the access management plan they are expressed with terms like should and encouraged ii standards are specific development and design controls that govern quantitative and measurable objectives such as the location and spacing of driveways they are expressed with terms like shall and must and are often described in tables and iii diagrams that show precise dimensions or fixed limits within which a proposed design must fall many guidelines and standards are dependent upon site specific conditions including topography property lines prior site development and sight distances that may prevent the strict application of the guidelines and standards in such cases the city of lebanon engineering department will evaluate the options and determine the appropriate application of the guideline or standard in question the following access management guidelines and standards apply to all properties abutting and street intersections along south hartmann drive between i40 and w main street in the city of lebanon 3 street network providing combined arterial and collector street spacing at closer intervals improves access opportunities reduces traffic where streets meet and allows for reduced cross sections although northsouth street connectivity in the corridor area is generally sufficient with approximately  mile spacing of arterials and collectors eastwest connectivity is poor particularly between hickory ridge road and leeville pike street spacing the minimum of combined arterial and collector spacing should be  mile accordingly spacing of arterials and collectors at multiples of adopted signal spacing see below signalized intersection spacing will facilitate arterialtoarterial and arterialtocollector intersections a new collector road should be constructed between hickory ridge road and leeville pike to improve eastwest connectivity and provide the recommended  mile arterialcollector city of lebanon subdivision regulations  of 81 spacing sidewalks for all new developments abutting a collector or arterial street onsite sidewalk installation will be required a continuous allweather sidewalk constructed to a minimum of five feet shall run parallel to the roadway at the front of the parcel a buffer zone of 24 inches must separate the sidewalk from the edge of pavement allowing for an appropriate buffer from vehicular and bicycle traffic as well as future sidewalk connections to adjacent parcels when built new sidewalks shall comply with the standards of the city government  however a design compatible with existing conditions may be considered and approved by the city engineering department upon the advice of the appropriate city government agencies provided constructing such design would cost no more than would full compliance with public sidewalk standards auxiliary lanes right turn deceleration lanes are required when the outside lane has an expected volume of greater than 250 mph and the right turn volume is greater than 55 mph left turn deceleration lanes are required at all median openings where left turns are expected to occur deceleration lanes shall be designed in accordance with city and tdot standards with left turn and right turn storage lengths determined traffic analysis 4 traffic signal systems long and uniform spacing of traffic signals allows for coordinated signals that reduce delays and improve safety currently there are six signalized intersections on the study segment of south hartmann drive including the northern limit at w main street with an average signal spacing of 046 miles the shortest signalized intersection spacing within the study limits is 020 miles approximately 1050 feet between franklin road and the shopping center entrancefuture crowell lane signal spacing i ideally traffic signals should be spaced  mile apart for efficient signal progression at speeds of 30 mph to 45 mph maximizing flow rates while minimizing fuel consumption and emissions distances between signals should not vary by more than 10% in order that good progression of traffic may be maintained in both directions ii  mile spacing of signalized intersections typically allows efficient traffic progression at speeds of 40 mph using a common 90 second cycle length in offpeak conditions a shorter cycle may allow efficient progression at higher speeds while in peak periods a longer cycle up to 120 seconds may be used for 30 mph progression table 10 shows optimal signal spacing for efficient progression at various speedscycle lengths city of

conflicts and friction into the traffic stream as vehicles enter and leave traffic lanes the 28 existing access points on south hartmann drive between i40 and west main street or approximately 11 access points per mile plus future connections will present both operational and safety issues number of driveways the maximum number of driveways is established in table 11 table 11 maximum number of driveways lot frontage number of driveways up to 150 feet 1 150 feet to 299 feet 2 each additional 300 feet 1 unsignalized street and driveway spacing the minimum spacing for unsignalized streets and driveways shall be as shown in table 12 the required spacing between unsignalized street andor commercial driveways is based on the minimum separation of driveways to reduce crash potential due to rightturn conflict overlap each driveway presents the driver with a minimum of two conflict points as they must be alert for a rightturning vehicle entering mainline traffic or a vehicle making a rightturn into a driveway the recommended spacing requires each driver to monitor a single driveway at a time improving safety and traffic operations all driveways serving properties other than singlefamilyduplex residential or farming are considered commercial spacing between driveways is measured from near edge to near edge of adjacent driveways table 12 minimum connection spacing city of lebanon subdivision regulations  of 81 connection distance feet  unsignalized street and commercial driveway 350 noncommercial driveway 50 the city engineering department may allow two oneway driveways to serve a commercial property distances between adjacent oneway commercial driveways with inbound traffic upstream from the outbound drive must have a minimum separation distance of 25 feet islands having a minimum length of 25 feet measured parallel to the highway must be built between the closely spaced driveways to form definite entrances and exits joint access and cross access joint and cross access are methods of allowing adjacent properties to share driveways and parking facilities joint access is where two adjacent property owners share a driveway along their common property line cross access is where traffic moves between adjacent properties without reentering the public roadway if an access applicant is unable to comply with the driveway spacing standards listed above the applicant must attempt to obtain an access or mutual driveway easement from the adjacent property as to allow for one egress to serve two properties if located all or partially on the applicants property then the adjacent property owners must agree to relocate any existing access to the proposed access and the relocation must be performed in conjunction with the applicants development of the property if the applicant is unable to obtain an access or mutual driveway easement from an adjacent property owner then the access of the applicants property shall be located on its own property in an area acceptable to the city engineering department corner clearance important considerations in the safety and operation of intersections are the concepts of functional intersection area and corner clearance corner clearance is minimum distance required between an intersection and an upstream or downstream driveway extending beyond the physical area of the intersection to include the portions of the roadway that are influenced by the intersection figure 10 upstream from the intersection the corner clearance provides room for vehicles to navigate the intersection including turn lanes and queues downstream the functional distance extends from the far side of the intersection to provide guidance and tracking to vehicles passing or turning from the intersection the purpose of corner clearance is to physically separate the functional area of an intersection from the conflicting movements in the area of influence of an adjacent driveway and provide sufficient stacking space for queued vehicles at the intersection so that the driveway is not obstructed by traffic backed up from the intersection city of lebanon subdivision regulations  of 81 figure 10 functional intersection area transportation research board 2003 corner clearance is measured like driveway separation from the closest edge of the driveway connection to the closest edge of the parallel roadway unless an exception is granted the minimum corner clearance for driveways on all four legs of an intersection will be established by an intersection queuing analysis or 200 feet whichever is larger and applicable exceptions may be approved if as a result of the access management standards the property would become landlocked if an exception to the minimum corner clearance is requested and approved the access will be rightinrightout only and under no circumstances will any part of a driveway be permitted to connect with either the major street or intersecting side street within 50 feet from the near edge of the adjacent street throat length distances the connection depth of a driveway throat length as measured from the edge of the abutting roadway to the near edge of the internal circulation road or buffer area shall be of sufficient length to allow a driver to enter the site without interfering with the mainline of traffic figure 11 table 13 shows the minimum throat lengths based on the site activities city staff will assist the applicant in determining the appropriate site activity category table 13 minimum throat length site activity throat lengths regional shopping centers malls

program nchrp report 420 impacts of access management techniques found that raised medians reduce crashes by over 40 percent in urban areas and over 60 percent in rural areas based on crash data in seven states in the divided portion of south hartmann drive northbound and southbound traffic are separated by two foot inside shoulders and a fourteen 14 foot wide raised median consisting of concrete curb surrounding a grass plot concrete on the bartons creek bridge there are median openings at intersecting roadways existing access points to adjacent properties and planned future access points the median openings are flush pavement which continues as a striped flush median on either side of the intersecting roadway or driveway to the start of the left turn lanes if applicable with an average distance of approximately 400 feet between a given access point and resumption of the raised median city of lebanon subdivision regulations  of 81 median opening spacing the unsignalized median opening functions as an intersection median openings should be designed with auxiliary lanes that allow left turning vehicles to decelerate without interfering with the of the leftmost lane full median openings shall be spaced a minimum of 1320 feet apart appropriately spaced median openings have already been constructed on the portion of south hartmann drive within the study area and no additional full median openings should be considered article iv development prerequisite to final approval a perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a prospective lot buyer
