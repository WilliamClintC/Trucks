becoming a major industry in the city the city supports this major industry and has recently undertaken the creation and development of a tax increment financing district in the downtown area of the city in order to revitalize and redevelop the city and to attract tourists to the community 2 moreover as the tourist industry grows and expands the city must make provision to increase certain municipal services in order to accommodate the needs of tourists who visit from time to time 3 the cost of providing the special services required by the tourism industry should be apportioned equitably between the citys residents and those who visit the city and enjoy the special benefits the city provides to them it is necessary for the promotion of the common interests of the residents of the city as well as those who are visitors to the city to provide a method to alleviate the added financial burden on city resources in providing the services and improvements needed to support tourism and the resulting transient population 4 in order to raise the necessary sums to defray a portion of those added costs it is appropriate to impose a charge the receipts of which will pay costs related to a the provision of municipal services which serve such visitors or tourists  and b capital projects which not only enrich the citys residents but also contribute to the tourism industry 5 cognizant of the need for municipalities to be given direct statutory authorization to raise moneys earmarked to defray such costs related to the tourism industry the state general assembly adopted act no 138 during its 1997 session now codified in part as sections 61500 to 61570 the enabling act of the south carolina laws of 197 as amended the sc  while the general assembly utilized the terms accommodations tax as a means by which to designate the charge authorized to be imposed upon transients as such term is defined in the enabling act it is the intent of city council to impose such charge as an accommodations fee pursuant to the provisions of this article 6 it is a well established principle of state law that the use of a particular term is not determinative of its characterization see jackson v breeland 88 se 128 103 sc 184 1915 as set forth in brown v county of horry 417 se2d 565308 sc 180 1992 the factors that are of paramount importance to the analysis of whether a charge constitutes a tax or a fee are the following a the purpose behind its imposition  b the intended portion of the community that will be charged  and c the dedication of the sums so collected to the purpose for which it is charged 7 city council finds that its actions in a imposing an accommodations fee upon those persons utilizing the accommodations service businesses  and b segregating the collections received from such fees in order that such sums are used only for tourism related costs and expenditures authorized by the enabling act  meet the test enunciated in brown such that the charges imposed pursuant to the provisions of this article constitute fees  6272000 authority this chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of title 5 of the sc including without

follows in this chapter    572013 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages    572013 statement of purpose and objectives a it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by

to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands c the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding d floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs    572013 lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard

occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on

activity and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation  2 all stormwater conveyance systems for any evidence of or the potential for pollutants entering these systems  3 all bmps identified in the osswppp  4 all discharge locations to ascertain whether the implemented bmps are effective in preventing the discharge of sediment from the site where discharge locations are inaccessible nearby downstream locations must be inspected to the extent that such inspections are practicable  and 5 locations where vehicles enter or exit the site must be inspected for evidence of offsite sediment tracking if inspection responsibilities are not shared between the primary and secondary permittees each secondary permittee must provide their own inspections for the portions of

maintained and there is no additional disturbance in these areas once a definable area has reached final stabilization the permittee may mark this on the onsite swppp and no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site eg land disturbing activities around one of three buildings in a complex are completed and the disturbed area has reached final stabilization one mile of a roadway or pipeline project is completed and the disturbed area has reached final stabilization etc inspection of common bmps such as sediment basins sediment traps may be required to resume if areas that drain to them become disturbed during future construction c linear site inspection frequency utility line installation pipeline construction and other examples of long narrow linear construction activities may limit the access of inspection personnel to the areas described in subsection a of this section inspection of these areas could require that vehicles compromise temporarily or even permanently stabilized areas cause additional disturbance of soils and increase the potential for erosion 1 in these circumstances controls must be inspected on the same frequencies as other construction projects but representative inspections may be performed for representative inspections personnel must inspect controls along the construction site for 025 mile above and below each

article xii  stormwater utility findings the city council makes the following findings of fact 1 stormwater management activities including but not limited to the maintenance of the citys stormwater system including pipes ditches channels catchbasins outfalls and drainage easements are critical to reducing pollution sedimentation flooding and erosion these maintenance activities and practices help to protect the health and safety of the citys residents 2 a schedule of stormwater utility service charges based on the area of impervious coverage on each property is an appropriate means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities throughout the city such charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs including but not limited to allocations of other revenues available to the city special service fees special assessments and other revenues as deemed appropriate by the city council 3 credits against stormwater utility service charges are an appropriate means of adjusting fees rates rentals charges fines and penalties in certain cases and should be granted for properties providing onsite or offsite services systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of said property on the citys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities and that such credits should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city manager or designee 4 the stormwater fee schedule will be applicable for the duration of an initial twoyear interim period during this interim period a stormwater utility rate study will be developed to determine the accurate fees needed to manage protect regulate and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities of the city and to determine what fees are appropriate fair and reasonable to charge the citizens of the community in the future the stormwater utility rate study shall establish the appropriate credits that may be available once the accurate fees have been determined the base rate will be revised upon completion of the rate study to meet long term needs of the stormwater management program 5 the runoff associated with impervious surfaces on each property is the principal factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge 6 all revenues raised implementation of the stormwater utility shall be allocated specifically to stormwater management services and stormwater management systems such revenues shall be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs and debt service of bonds for

the city water system will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a droughtrelated shortage the division satisfies the requirements of the drought response act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use sanitation and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner b this division outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the city water system these actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply c to satisfy these goals the city water system hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water this division is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the city water system d if it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought the city water system is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual wateruse demands the proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that wateruse for human consumption sanitation fire protection and other essential needs becomes endangered e immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation regulations and restrictions set forth under this division shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded f water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this division are considered to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water subjecting the offenders to penalties a 4152003 moderate drought phase upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist andor upon determination by the city water system that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels the city water system will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods specifically the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of 20 percent in residential water use and 15 percent in other water uses such as commercial industrial institutional and irrigation  and a reduction in overall water use of 15 percent to accomplish this the city water system will take the following actions 1 issue a proclamation to be released to local media the citys water system customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that moderate drought

the approval of a traffic signal on projected volumes may be deferred until volumes meet warrants given in the mutcd the developer should make any lane improvements during construction so that if in the horizon year a signal is warranted one may be installed with little impact to the intersection 10 mitigation and alternatives  the traffic impact study should include proposed improvements or access management techniques that will mitigate falling in the levels of service below c which is considered as acceptable operating speed in urban conditions in areas where baseline or existing levels of service are at or below level of service c the baseline level of service shall be maintained or improved after development if the baseline level of service is f and the location is in a congested area the zoning administrator andor planning commission shall determine any required mitigation the baseline level of service shall include all committed funded road improvements and all

drives parking and service areas shall be for safe and convenient access for service and emergency vehicles streets shall be laid out to not encourage outside traffic to traverse the development or create unnecessary fragmentation of the project into small blocks in general the project shall be consistent with uses and shape of the site and convenience and safety of occupants and persons frequenting the project 2 vehicular access to collector and arterial streets or portions of streets from offstreet parking and service areas shall be so combined limited located designed and controlled as to channel traffic to and from such areas conveniently safely and in a manner that minimize traffic friction and promotes free flow of traffic or streets without excessive interruption g the external criteria for projects defined in 7d5 and 7d6 shall observe the following 1 principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movement and minimize hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic merging and turning lanes andor traffic dividers shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need 2 such projects shall not be permitted access to a local street buy may border or front on such a street 3 pedestrian access where provided shall be by safe and convenient routes where there are crossings or pedestrian ways an vehicular routes at edges of the project such crossings shall be safely located marked and controlled  and where such ways are exposed to substantial automotive traffic safeguards including fencing may be required to prevent crossings except at designated points 4 driveway design must follow the aashto a policy on geometric design of highways and streets greenbook 2004 guidelines driveways are in effect intersections and should be designed consistent with their intended use ideally driveways should not be located within the functional area of a roadway intersection

subdivisions or site plans on the road network adjacent to such projects the service levels of the affected streets shall be investigated 1 the level of service for streets and roads is defined according to the 1985 highway capacity manual in terms of vehicular delay delay is a measure of driver time varied and complex factors contributing to delay include intersection geometry frequency of curb cuts traffic volumes signalization and cycle length etc the quantitative measurements delays in seconds per vehicle are defined in the chapters of signalized intersections  and of unsignalized intersections  2 the various levels of service are classified a depending on the delay factor and the traffic conditions as follows level of service a level of service d  free flow conditions high density but stable flow low volumes  restricted speeds little or no delays  noticeable delays at signals uninterrupted flow  little freedom to maneuver no restriction on maneuverability drivers maintain desired speed level of service e low but relatively uniform operating speeds level of service b volumes at or near capacity stable flow conditions approaching unacceptable delays at signals operating speeds beginning to be restricted level of service f level of service c forced flow conditions  stable flow but speed and maneuverability restricted by higher traffic volumes stop and go operation satisfactory operating speed for urban conditions volumes below capacity may be zero some delays at signals average vehicle delay at signals is grater than one minute i application of
