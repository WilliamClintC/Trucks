disturbance   430102 statement of findings the governing body of the township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater g federal and state regulations require certain townships to implement a program of stormwater controls these townships are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national  430101 stormwater management and earth  430102   430103 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the neshaminy and delaware river south watersheds by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and minimization of the impacts described in  430102 of this chapter designed to pollutant discharge elimination system npdes h nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the township a promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the impacts on surface water and groundwater b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps c minimize increases in stormwater volume d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management g utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as possible h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source requiring a minimum of structures and relying on natural processes i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources j maintain existing baseflows and quality of streams and watercourses k meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a requiring protection and

is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the neshaminy creek watershed by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  431102 of this a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an

an attractive locale for both residential and nonresidential development and this trend can be expected to continue in the future many facets of the community are affected by growth either directly or indirectly these include the natural and manmade environment the transportation network and community services and facilities these impacts can be positive and negative thus zoning should allow growth to occur but should control those aspects of growth which are undesirable 1 goal to manage growth in middletown township so that both individual landowners rights and the interests of the community as a whole are protected 2 objectives a to promote a land use pattern that protects those historical cultural and natural features which are important to the character of the township while still allowing opportunities for growth b to direct more intensive development to those areas of the township which are most appropriate for growth and which can best accommodate it c to limit the impact of new development on existing development land use standards such as buffer yards and setback requirements d to develop regulations so that the individual landowner can choose a variety of alternative methods of using his land b environmental protection the environment is a common or public good of the pennsylvania constitution guarantees all citizens the right to public natural resources in the state the constitution provides for the state to protect these resources for present and future generations furthermore  604 of the pennsylvania municipalities planning that one of the purposes of

provide a wide range of opportunities for township residents commercial uses provide convenient goods and services while industrial uses provide employment opportunities both of these uses expand the tax base alleviating some of the tax burden on township residents a wide range of housing types presents opportunities for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and offers housing options for township residents thus the allocation of land for all reasonable uses will create numerous and expanded opportunities for township residents 2 proper land use planning creates the opportunity for a balance between the townships existing land uses and the demands of anticipated growth this balance is provided by allocating the land in the township for specific types and intensities of land use a goal to provide for a balanced community containing all reasonable types of land uses including residential commercial industrial agricultural recreational and institutional b objectives  to ensure that this chapter permits a variety of land uses in appropriate locations in the township  to ensure that this chapter permits a range of housing types at varying densities so that all socioeconomic groups have access to the community  to analyze all planning and zoning proposals to ensure that new growth and development enhance the balance of land uses in the township  500104 zoning  500104

5002803 general sign regulations amended 3231999 by  a the objectives of this article are to establish requirements for placing installing and maintaining signs in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens just as regulations for the placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the law so are regulations for the placement installation and maintenance of signs a valid use of the law because signs in the literal sense must be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as buildings produce b sign regulations are further justified by the primary purpose of a sign to draw attention to its content however since signs can distract drivers or obstruct views the very nature of a sign can be a potential hazard to the safety of the motorist therefore it is the intent of this article to regulate the location of signs in such a way that they can fulfill their purpose without causing unsafe conditions for motorists c finally it is the objective of this article to protect and preserve the visual character of the community by regulating the placement installation and maintenance of signs because signs are intended to command visual contact this gives them an important role in the overall visual character of a community this visual impact affects the value and enjoyment of property  therefore the regulation of signs can work to enhance the value of property encourage appropriate land use throughout a municipality and minimize visual clutter in the community d with this purpose in mind it is the intention of this article to authorize only those uses of signs which are 1 compatible with their surroundings 2
