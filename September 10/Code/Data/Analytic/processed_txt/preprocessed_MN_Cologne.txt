purpose and findings apurpose it is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexuallyoriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses within the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material bfindings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and northend cinema inc v seattle 585 p 2d 1153 wash 1978 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  los angeles california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  and beaumont texas  and also on findings found in the report of attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1sexuallyoriented businesses in the city lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises  2certain employees of sexuallyoriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of sexuallyoriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments  3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexuallyoriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows as defined under this chapter as adult bookstores adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motion picture theatres or adult arcades  4offering and providing the space encourages the activities which create unhealthy conditions  5persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexuallyoriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of the sexuallyoriented businesses  6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexuallyoriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection aids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  7since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 n 198 8555 in 198 and 253448   8the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990  9the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 12 million cases being reported in 1990  10the surgeon general of the united states in his or her report of 10221986 has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  11according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  12sanitary conditions in some sexuallyoriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  13numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexuallyoriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films  14the findings noted in divisions b1 b13 above raise substantial governmental concerns  15sexuallyoriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  16a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexuallyoriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexuallyoriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexuallyoriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  17removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial government interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres  18requiring licensees of sexuallyoriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in the establishments  19the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexuallyoriented businesses where the information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexuallytransmitted diseases  20it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to the activity  21the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter  22the barring of the individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexuallytransmitted diseases  and 23the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter passed 1252005  11002 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following
