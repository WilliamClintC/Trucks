beginning with supplement 8 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of joseph p matthews jr city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to

complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement

to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the

ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this title may be continued b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of completion of nonconforming projects part 2003   nonconforming lots a this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists b when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in minimum lot size requirements then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily residence that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot c when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements building setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with then the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations 2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety d for purposes of c compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however that an applicant is facing financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible  2007  part 2003   extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this title was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to completion of nonconforming projects a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to completion of nonconforming projects a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a sand pit may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this title and where the proposed expansion conforms to all applicable federal state and local regulations concerning the use d the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur e notwithstanding a any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations f notwithstanding a whenever i there exists a lot with one or more structures on it and ii a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and iii the parking or loading requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with completion of nonconforming projects if i parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and ii such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional use permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit   repair maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than twentyfive percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated since the time it became nonconforming may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed fifty percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in e extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations c for purposes of subsections a and b 1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections a or b by doing such work incrementally 3 the appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser d the community development director shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 no violation of extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations will occur and 2 the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this title applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation that an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible part 2003   change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning special use or conditional use permit in accordance with permits required may not be made except in accordance with subsections b d however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this title applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this title is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this title applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this title to issue a permit for that particular use the community development director or hearing examiner issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this title that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this title that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation that an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created d if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this title to issue a permit for that particular use community development director hearing examiner or city council issues a permit authorizing the change the permitissuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this title that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning special use or conditional use permit and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in c of this section are satisfied and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for part 2003   abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a when a nonconforming use is i discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is i discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one hundred eighty days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this title is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this title the one hundred eightyday period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this title part 2003   completion of

herein and also to restrict those uses that may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating within the airport protection district there are hereby created and established the following airport protection district and subdistricts based on the air space and land use safety surfaces for arlington municipal airport these subdistricts comprise the ap district and are shown on the official zoning map 1 airport protection subdistrict a is comprised of the following airport safety zones a runway protection zone rpz zone 1 the rpz boundary is trapezoidal in shape and centered about the extended runway centerline it begins two hundred feet beyond the future end of the area usable for takeoff or landing ie runway threshold the rpz dimensions are a function of the type of aircraft operating at the airport and the approach visibility minimums associated with each runway end based on the potential instrument approach improvements that are recommended in the airport layout plan update larger future rpz boundaries have been identified the future runway 16 rpz may be described as being one thousand feet at the inner width one thousand five hundred ten feet at the outer width and one thousand seven hundred feet in length with the runway 34 rpz boundary being 1000 x 1750 x 2500 respectively in addition both runways 1129 and 826 rpz boundaries may be described as two hundred fifty feet at the inner width four hundred fifty feet at the outer width and one thousand feet in length b inner safety zone isz zone 2 a rectangular area that is positioned on the extended runway centerline and adjacent to the rpz boundary defines the isz boundary for runway 16 the isz is one thousand five hundred feet wide overall extending seven hundred fifty feet laterally from the runway centerline and extends approximately two thousand one hundred feet beyond the rpz boundary for runway 34 the isz is one thousand five hundred feet wide overall extending seven hundred fifty feet laterally from the runway centerline and extends approximately three thousand three hundred feet beyond the rpz boundary for runway 1129 the isz is one thousand feet wide overall extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline and the isz outer boundary is defined by swinging an arc with a radius of three thousand feet that is on the runway centerline one thousand feet inward from the runway threshold c inner turning zone itz zone 3 the itz boundary is defined by a triangular shaped area that is positioned along each side of the rpz and isz boundaries for runway 16 the itz extends approximately five thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline one thousand five hundred feet inward from the future runway threshold within a 30degree sector of the extended runway centerline for runway 34 the itz extends approximately six thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline two thousand feet inward from the runway threshold within a twentydegree sector of the extended runway centerline for runway 1129 the itz extends approximately three thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline one thousand feet inward from the runway threshold within a thirtydegree sector of the extended runway centerline d outer safety zone osz zone 4 a rectangular area that is also centered on the runway defines the osz boundary for runway 16 the osz is one thousand feet wide overall extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline and extends approximately three thousand feet beyond the isz for runway 34 the osz is one thousand feet wide overall extending five feet laterally from the runway centerline and extends approximately four thousand feet beyond the isz for runway 1129 the osz is one thousand feet wide overall extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline and extends approximately one thousand five hundred feet beyond the isz e sideline safety zone ssz zone 5 for runway 1634 the ssz boundary is defined by a one thousand foot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the itzs on each end of the runway for runway 1129 the ssz boundary is defined by a five hundredfoot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the itzs on each end of the runway for the ultralightsport runway 826 the ssz boundary is defined by a four hundredfoot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the itzs on each end of the runway 2 airport protection subdistrict b is based on the arlington municipal airports traffic pattern the area on the west side of the airport is defined by connecting the outermost and western points of runway 1634 inner turning zones 3 with an arc that is tangent to a line centered on smokey point boulevard the area on the east side of the airport is defined by continuing the arcs of inner turning zones 3 east of runway 1634 to a point where they meet a line centered on 63 rd avenue ne a line centered on 63 rd avenue ne then connects the ends of the two arcs 3 airport protection subdistrict c is based on the faa ac 150520033a guidelines for the type of aircraft operating at arlington municipal airport the distance recommended by the ac for an airport that serves turbine aircraft is ten thousand feet from aircraft operation areas aoa this boundary coincides with the outer boundary of the transitional surface and the inner boundary of the conical surface 4 airport protection subdistrict d is comprised of the following federal aviation regulations far parts 77 imaginary surfaces a primary surfaces a surface that is longitudinally centered on the runway extending two hundred feet beyond the paved threshold in each direction runway 1634s ultimate primary surface measures one thousand feet across because it is to become a precision instrument runway runway 1129s ultimate primary surface measures two hundred fifty feet across since it is to remain a utility runway with only visual approaches b approach surface inclined planes extending upward and outward from the ends of the primary surfaces the approach for runway 16 has been established in support of a future nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums greater than  of a mile the approach for runway 34 has been established in support of a future precision instrument approach with visibility minimums lower than  of a mile as specified in far runway 16s future approach surface will be one thousand feet wide at the intersection with the primary surface will extend outward for a distance of ten thousand feet at a slope of  and will reach an outer width of three thousand five hundred feet the future approach surface for runway 34 will extend outward for a distance of ten thousand feet at a slope of  and another forty thousand feet at a slope of  the approach surface will reach an outer width of sixteen thousand feet wide at fifty thousand feet runway 1129s approach surfaces are the same at both runway ends the approach surfaces are two hundred fifty feet across at the primary surface and extend outward for a distance of 5000 feet at a  slope to an outer width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet c horizontal surface a horizontal plane one hundred fifty feet above the established airport elevation the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of five thousand feet radii from the center of each primary surface of runway 1634 tangents then connect the adjacent arcs d transitional surfaces an inclined plane with a slope of  extending upward and outward from the primary and approach surfaces terminating at the point where they intersect with the horizontal surface or any surface with more critical restriction e conical surfaces a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet  2007  part 2006   restrictions on certain use classifications on arlington

designations z s c in table of permissible uses a subject to community development director jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit when used in connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses  the letter p means that the use is permissible with a valid city business license the letters zv mean that the use is permissible with a zoning verification approval the letters acup mean that the use is permissible with an administrative conditional use permit the letter z means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the community development director the letter s means a special use permit must be obtained from the community development director or hearing examiner and the letter c means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the hearing examiner b when used in connection with residential uses use classification  the designation zsc means that such developments of less than twenty dwelling units must be pursuant to a zoning permit developments of twenty or more but less than fifty dwelling units need a special use permit and developments of fifty or more dwelling units require a conditional use permit c when used in connection with nonresidential uses the designation zs or zc means that such developments require a zoning permit if the total area to be developed is less than four acres in size and a special or conditional use permit respectively if the total area is four acres or larger in area the area to be developed shall be measured using a rectangular perimeter enclosing the full extent of the onsite development including any development that may be necessary to meet the requirements of this title if development occurs in succession over time then a special

uses part 2003  1052015   community development director jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter whenever the table of permissible uses interpreted in the light of use of the designations z s c in table of permissible uses and the other provisions of this chapter provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit a special use permit shall nevertheless be required if the community development director finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the community development director shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question part 2003   permissible uses and specific exclusions a the presumption established by this title is that all legitimate uses of land are addressed within the table of permissible uses and are either allowed or not allowed thereby but because the list of permissible uses set forth in table of permissible uses cannot be allinclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses b notwithstanding a all distinct uses that are not listed in table of permissible uses even given the liberal interpretation mandated by a are prohibited nor shall table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts similarly all uses listed but left blank under the zone compatibility columns are prohibited c without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts 1 any use that involves the manufacture handling sale distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the citys fire prevention code 2 stockyards slaughterhouses rendering plants 3 use of a travel trailer motor home or other recreational vehicle as a permanent residence temporary residence is permitted under certain conditions pursuant to recreational vehicles as temporary dwelling units 4 use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which out of which or from which any goods are sold or stored any services are performed or other business is conducted this prohibition does not apply to temporary public services such as bookmobiles blood donation centers public service information etc situations that do not comply with this subsection on the effective date of this title are required to conform within thirty days 5 the following activities including any similar activities are prohibited as home occupations in all zones marijuana production marijuana processing and marijuana retail part 2003  232014   accessory uses a the table of permissible uses  classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use i constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or ii is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use b for purposes of interpreting a 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use 2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness c without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses 1 offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot or lots where the principal use occupies more than one lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation 2 hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature 3 the renting out of one or two rooms within a singlefamily residence which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit other than on a daily or weekly basis to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the singlefamily dwelling 4 yard sales or garage sales so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot or lots where the principal use occupies more than one lot for more than three days whether consecutive or not during any ninetyday period d without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts 1 abandoned vehicles as regulated by amc abandoned vehicles part 2003  1052015   permissible uses not requiring land use permits notwithstanding any other provisions of this title no zoning special use or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses 1 electric power telephone telegraph cable television gas water and sewer lines wires or pipes together with supporting poles or structures located within a public rightofway 2 neighborhood but not regional utility facilities located within a public rightofway with the permission of the owner state or city of the rightofway part 2003  1052015   change in use a a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever a new use or activity conducted on a lot creates a more intensive impact to the site in question or to the infrastructure of the city than the previous use as determined by the community development director andor his or her designee b a mere change in the status of property from occupied to unoccupied or vice versa does not constitute a substantial change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than one hundred eighty consecutive days or has been abandoned c a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a substantial change in use  2007  part 2003   combination uses a when a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning special use or conditional use then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be 1 a conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit 2 a special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit but none requires a conditional use permit 3 a zoning permit in all other cases this is indicated in the table of permissible uses by the designation zsc in each of the columns adjacent to the

individuals cottage housing is provided as part of the citys overall housing strategy which intends to encourage affordability innovation and variety in housing design and site development while ensuring compatibility with existing neighborhoods and to promote a variety of housing choices to meet the needs of a population diverse in age income household composition and individual needs 2 the cottage housing development design standards are intended to create a small community of cottages oriented around open space that is pedestrianoriented and minimizes the visibility of offstreet parking these design standards are intended to ensure that cottage housing developments include pedestrian amenities and take advantage of existing natural features on the site including topography and vegetation the cottage housing development design standards are intended to maintain traditional cottage amenities and proportions and ensure that cottage housing developments contribute to the overall community character because there may be alternative designs that meet the objectives of the design standards the provisions of provide an alternative design review process to consider other acceptable ways to accomplish the objectives of this section 3 all cottage housing developments are subject to current city stormwater standards and shall incorporate stormwater low impact development techniques whenever possible    applicability application process and design review applicability of this section application procedure and the process for design review is pursuant to amc    density number of cottage housing units and minimum lot area see density and dimensional standards for residential zones    building height structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed to be

part 2003  1192010 old town residential infill design standards   purpose and intent old town is a unique district in arlington representing as the name implies the old part of town it is laid out in a streetandalley grid pattern with garages and utilities predominately on the alleys there is a predominance of older homes built in historic architectural styles and most have front porches small though many of the older homes are built on parcels consisting of two or three lots some of which are now nonconforming in terms of size or setbacks back at the turn of the 20th century this was common practice however with the increase in value of these lots many property owners are selling them to builders who are building new homes that do not fit the unique historic character of old town many have caused problems with existing residents because of privacy setback and scale issues at the same time infill development is one of the strategies adopted citys comprehensive plan to meet its growth targets but not its only strategy and certainly not at the expense of substantially changing the character of the old town business and residential districts thus the intent of this part is to 1 preserve the historic development pattern found in old town 2 protect property owners ability to sell their excess lots 3 protect existing property values by encouraging compatible development 4 implement a design code for old town that permits infill development in a manner that is acceptable to the community while retaining the elements that provide for the traditional residential and main street style of growth 5 recognizing the mix of architectural styles that have been built over the neighborhoods one hundred plus years it is the citys intent to promote the specific architectural styles and development patterns that are historically prevalent and characteristic of the old town district  2004  2004 part 2003  722018   applicability this part shall apply to all residential

welfare of its citizenry therefore the city does ordain as follows  7182016   findings of fact a the special flood hazard areas of the city encompass a very small area twotenths of one percent of the developable lands within the corporate limits of the city these areas are subject to periodic inundation of floodwaters due to storm surges and runoff which may result in property damage public safety disruption of commerce and other consequences b the national flood insurance program is adopted by the city which aims to reduce the impact of flooding on private and public structures it does so by providing affordable insurance to property owners and by encouraging communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations the efforts help mitigate the effects of flooding on new and improved structures c on  the national marine fisheries service nmfs issued a biological opinion that required changes to the implementation of the national flood insurance program in order to meet the requirements of the endangered species act esa in the puget sound watershed the city enacted regulations that allow development that meets the criteria specified in the biological opinion as a

instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of these terms these terms also refer to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries correspond to the actual physical location of floodways and floodplains as shown on femas flood insurance rate map firm and should be shown on the map identified in the citys adopted shoreline master plan these overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy rather than physical criteria therefore the administrator is authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the boundaries of floodways or floodplains if there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions such interpretations like other decisions of the administrator may be appealed pursuant to appeals b as used in this chapter the term riparian habitat zone rhz is identified on the approved rhz map the rhz is an overlay zone that encompasses lands as defined above on either side of all streams and for all other watercourse including off channel areas within the special flood hazard areas the rhz is a no new disturbance zone other than for activities that will not adversely affect the existing habitat function any property or

determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  4 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare g variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection i1 and otherwise complies with a general standards 2c and utility systems in floodways and floodplains h any applicant to whom a variance is granted is hereby notified that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation i in granting a variance in addition to the findings of variances

parking standards set forth in f table of parking requirements may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in number of parking spaces required the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of f table of parking requirements and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in a b without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in f table of parking requirements when it finds that 1 a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly or other demographic group that due to the driving characteristics of the group requires fewer or more parking stalls than the general populace  or 2 a sole business not part of a larger mall is primarily oriented to walkin trade c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in f table of parking requirements it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by f table of parking requirements for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in amendments part 2003   parking space dimensions a subject to subsection b and except accessible parking spaces as per accessible parking spaces each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at

backing onto a public street this requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged b parking areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation emergency and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements c every parking area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rightsofway such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall vegetation or other obstruction however in order to reduce total impervious surfaces parking spaces may be designed so that vehicles overhang perimeter landscape areas and the overhang though landscaped may count toward the parking space dimension required by parking space dimensions except that that portion of the landscaped area may not count toward the landscape or screening requirements referenced in e such landscaped area shall be planted with appropriate materials such that vehicles do not cause damage to the landscaping nor viceversa d circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas e other requirements affecting the design can be found in shade trees on  compliance with screening standard and shade trees in

one use may not be credited to any other use b to the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times the same spaces may be credited to both uses for example if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on monday but is generally ninety percent vacant on weekends another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent of the spaces on that lot alternatively if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent of capacity on days other than sunday another development could make use of fifty percent of the church lots spaces on those other days c the developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present a contract as evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces the developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends

screening and trees screening   council findings concerning the need for screening requirements a the council finds that 1 screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise dust and glare 2 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3 screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4 the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare part 2003   general screening standard a every development shall provide sufficient screening so that 1 neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development  2 the development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads part 2003   compliance with screening standard a except as modified per special screening requirements the table set forth in table of screening requirements in conjunction with the explanations in  descriptions of screens concerning the types of screens establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general standards established in general screening standard however this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered in accordance with flexibility in administration required b the numerical designations contained in the table of screening requirements  are keyed to the table of permissible uses  and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in descriptions of screens this table indicates the type of screening that is presumptively required between two uses where such screening is required only the property under application for development is responsible for installing the screening the use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the burdened use in table of screening requirements and the other use is the benefited use to determine the type of screening a proposed new development must install begin under the burdened column with the use classification number of the proposed use and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the use classification number of each use that adjoins the property to be developed for each intersecting square that contains a letter the developer must install the level of screening indicated along this portion bordering that use c if when the analysis described in b is performed the burdened use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation subject to all the provisions of nonconforming situations of this title d notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter a multifamily development shall be required at the time of construction to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in table of screening requirements e developments in the old town business districts 1 2 and 3 shall be exempt from the screening requirements of table of screening requirements pertaining to screening along streets where the buildings abut the sidewalk part 2003   descriptions of screens the following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth in table of screening requirements 1 opaque screen type a a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet the width shall be a minimum of five feet wide but may be increased if in the opinion of the permitissuing authority it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses  and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required an opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation the opaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm native vegetation droughttolerant vegetation vegetated lid facilities or existing vegetation compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in the department of public works construction standards and specifications 2 semiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet the width shall be a minimum of five feet wide but may be increased if in the opinion of the permitissuing authority it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses  and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required the semiopaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces the semiopaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm native vegetation droughttolerant vegetation vegetated lid facilities or existing vegetation compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in the department of public works construction standards and specifications 3 intermittent screen type c a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty feet the width shall be a minimum of five feet wide but may be increased if in the opinion of the permitissuing authority it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses  and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required the intermittent screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of native vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the screen may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in department of public works construction standards and specifications part 2003  10192015   table of screening requirements see table 207610 screening requirements part 2003   flexibility in administration required a the council recognizes that because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements therefore as provided in with screening standard the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of table of screening requirements and may either require more intensive or allow less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in general screening standard without imposing unnecessary costs on the developer b without limiting the generality of a the permitissuing authority may modify the presumptive requirements for 1 nonresidential developments located adjacent to nonconforming residential uses in nonresidential zoning districts 2 nonresidential uses located adjacent to other similar uses within the same zoning district 3 any development where it is found that the presumptive requirement would cause a nuisance or sight distance problem 4 where type a screening is required along a street if the office or other similar nonintensive portion of the use is placed between the street and the intensive portion of the use then only type b screening is necessary between that nonintensive portion and the street 5 whenever a building is located adjacent to or within five feet of a street rightofway as encouraged by the development design guidelines and the applicant includes windows intended to provide pedestrian visibility into the establishment then the screening requirement may be modified by requiring only low growing vegetation so as not to block such visibility c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in of screening requirements it shall enter on the face of the permit the screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in screening standard and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that a presumption established by of screening requirements is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of screening requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in amendments  2004   11172003  part 2003   combination uses a in determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use and another use the permitissuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly relying on the table set forth in table of screening requirements interpreted in the light of flexibility in administration required the developer shall be required to install the strictest form of screening required by any one of these principal uses b when two or more principal uses are combined to create a combination use screening shall not be required between the component principal uses unless they are clearly separated physically and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth in general screening standard part 2003   subdivisions a when nonresidential undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold the subdivider shall not be required to install any screening screening shall be required if at all only when the lots are developed and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the other requirements of of this chapter b when residential undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold the subdivider shall be required to install any perimeter screening required part 2003   special screening requirements a due to the potential for significantly worse adverse impacts between the following noncompatible uses in addition to the other requirements of this chapter a thirtyfoot wide landscaped screen shall be maintained along common boundaries between the below listed districts or uses 1 all uses within all residential and industrial zoning districts adjacent to interstate 5 state route 9 state route 530 and state route 531 east of 67 th avenue ne shall maintain said screen along said roads 2 wherever any nonresidential zoning district abuts a residential zoning district all uses within the nonresidential district shall maintain said screen along common boundaries for the purposes of this section where a road separates the zoning districts the properties are not considered to abut b the screen shall consist of visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least thirty feet at maturity  including evergreen trees planted at least three deep this screen is intended to minimize all visual and noise contact between uses and to create a strong impression of visual separation the screen may be composed of planted or existing vegetation and the retention of existing significant trees that are not prone to windthrow is strongly encouraged compliance of planted or natural vegetative screens will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity there should not be any unobstructed openings to a height of ten feet c the permitissuing authority may approve averaging of buffer widths to prevent denial of all reasonable use of property  11172003  part 2003  2007  part 2003 shading   council findings and declaration of policy on shade trees a the council finds that 1 trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival 2 trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe 3 trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems 4 trees have an important role in neutralizing stormwater passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers 5 trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control 6 trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas and 7 for the reasons indicated in 6 trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values b based upon the findings set forth in a the council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the citys planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this chapter to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments part 2003   required trees along dedicated streets along both sides of all newly created widened or improved streets that are constructed in accordance with the public street standards set forth in streets and sidewalks the developer shall either plant or retain sufficient trees so that within the landscape strip there is for every thirty feet of street frontage at least an average of one deciduous tree of two inches dbh at the time of planting and with a canopy that starts at least eight feet above finished grade and has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least eight inches in diameter root barriers shall be provided for all street trees and the landscape strip shall be planted per the department of public works standards and specifications it is a violation of this title to pave or cover the landscape strip with impervious material or to park motor vehicles on this strip when the developer plants trees pursuant to this section the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the department of public works design standards and specifications part 2003   protection of street trees unless specifically authorized by the citys responsible official no person shall damage any street tree attach any rope wire nails advertising posters or other contrivance to any street tree  allow any gaseous liquid or solid substance

tunnels trenches or lay any drive within a radius of ten feet of any street tree  deposit place or store any materials which may impede the free passage of water and fertilizer to the roots of any street tree part 2003   retention and protection of significant trees a every development shall retain all existing significant trees and significant stands of trees with a diameter at breast height dbh of at least eight inches for deciduous trees and at least twelve inches dbh for evergreen trees unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development or in the opinion of the permitissuing authority cause a significant safety problem b no excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the critical root zone crz where feasible which may extend outside of the drip line of existing tree branches of any of the trees regulated by subsection a and except for street trees no impervious surface including but not limited to paving or buildings may be located within twelve and onehalf feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree eighteen inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development for purposes of this subsection a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground c the retention or protection of significant trees and significant stands of trees as provided in subsections a and b unreasonably burdens a development if to accomplish such retention or protection the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer d when significant trees or significant stands of trees are present on a site for which a land use permit is submitted the applicant shall provide a tree survey showing size type and location of all significant trees and stands of trees critical root zones shall be fenced prior to construction with orange plastic mesh fencing or approved equivalent any significant trees removed because their retention would unreasonably burden a development shall be replaced with fivegallonsized native species at a ratio of three to one if the replacement trees are to be planted on building lots the developer shall provide adequate protection from damage during construction or planting shall occur after construction in which case a planting plan and security shall be provided to ensure their planting e if it is physically impossible to replant all replacement trees onsite then the applicant may mitigate the loss of trees by either planting trees on public property within the city as approved by the community development director andor paying a mitigation fee into the citys tree mitigation inlieu fund this fee shall be set forth in the citys fee resolution and equal the cost of the trees and planting labor f if any significant tree identified to be protected pursuant to this section is removed or damaged to the extent that its ability to survive is seriously threatened without the citys prior written consent the loss shall be remedied pursuant to c penalties and remedies for violations with the understanding that each tree so removed or damaged shall be counted as a separate violation g if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsections a or b and as a result the parking requirements set forth in parking cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections a and b up to a maximum of fifteen percent of the required spaces  2006  part 2003  10192015   shade trees on lots a each new or existing lot within the city shall maintain a minimum number of trees onsite as specified in b this section shall be enforced at the time that any land use or building permit is issued if fewer than the required trees exist on a lot for which a land use or building permit is applied the granting of the permit shall be conditioned on the planting of trees to meet the requirements of this section b the minimum number of required trees depends on the zoning district in which the site falls as follows 1 suburban residential residentiallowmoderate density residential moderate density and old town  two trees per lot 2 all other zoning districtsthe tree requirement is satisfied by compliance with general screening standard special screening requirements required trees along dedicated streets and shade trees in parking areas c if street trees are present or are required to be installed as part of a

factors including but not limited to the type of activity proposed eg harvesting thinning etc its scale location of the property the affected environment and future use of the site the description of the classes of forest practices paraphrased below are intended to summarize the classifications and do not supersede the specific definitions described in wac 22216 and rcw 7609 and this chapter 1 class i are those minor forest practices that have no direct potential for damaging a public resource that a occur entirely outside of land designed as an urban growth area  b on land not platted after   and c on land not intended for immediate conversion to another use examples of class i forest practices include timber harvests on parcels where contiguous ownership is less than two acres in size that are not within a shoreline designation or uga and none of the operation takes place within the riparian management zone of a type 2 or 3 water or within the ordinary high water mark of a type 4 water or flowing type 5 water  the culture and harvest of christmas trees and seedlings  tree planting and seeding  and cutting andor removal of less than five thousand board feet of timber for personal use eg firewood fence post etc in any consecutive twelvemonth period class i forest practices do not require approval or a permit by dnr 2 class ii are those forest practices which have less than an ordinary potential for damaging a public resource that a occur entirely outside of land designed as an urban growth area  b on land not platted after   and c on land not intended for immediate conversion to another use examples of class ii forest practices include the construction of advance fire trails  timber harvests of less than forty acres  and the partial cutting of forty percent or less of the live timber volume on a site class ii forest practices require notification to dnr prior to being conducted  they do not require an application property logged pursuant to a class ii

the dnr property logged pursuant to a class iii permit must be reforested and is intended to remain in timber production 4 class iv forest practices are divided into two categories as follows a class ivgeneral are those forest practices occurring i on lands within ugas and platted after   ii on lands which are being converted to a use other than commercial timber production  or iii on all lots tracts or parcels where a previous land development activity has been authorized and where a critical area site plan has been recorded against the title of the real property examples of class ivgeneral forest practices include harvest of timber and conversion of land to residential or commercial uses reforestation is not required under a class ivgeneral forest practices permit as the property subject to the permit is being converted to a nonforestry use all class ivgeneral forest practices are considered conversion forest practices b class ivspecial are those forest practices that have the potential to result in a substantial impact to the environment examples of class ivspecial forest practices include forest practices conducted on lands designated as critical wildlife habitat

previously ch 2093 was titled environmentally critical areas purpose and intent   purpose and intent this chapter establishes regulations for the protection of environmentally critical areas ecas including critical areas natural resource lands and protective buffers while it is intended that this chapter fulfill the mandates of the washington state growth management act that is not its sole purpose its primary purpose is to fulfill the legislative intent of the city which is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by providing for the longterm preservation of natural systems and their functions this is to be accomplished by establishing prohibitions mitigation requirements and minimum standards for the use and development of properties that contain or adjoin environmentally critical areas additionally this chapter is intended to 1 if at all possible avoid impacts to environmentally critical areas if this is not practicable then a minimize or limit the degree or magnitude of actions and their implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts b mitigate any impacts by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment c reduce or eliminate any impacts over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action d compensate for unavoidable impacts by replacing enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments of specific and cumulative impacts 2 protect the public from personal injury loss of life or property damage due to flooding erosion landslides seismic events or soil subsidence 3 protect against publicly financed expenditures due to the misuse of environmentally critical areas that cause a unnecessary maintenance and replacement of public facilities  b publicly funded mitigation of avoidable impacts  c cost for public emergency rescue and relief operations where the causes are avoidable  d degradation of the natural environment 4 protect aquatic resources 5 protect unique fragile and valuable elements of the environment including wildlife and its habitat 6 alert appraisers assessors owners potential buyers or lessees to the development limitations of environmentally critical areas 7 provide city officials with sufficient information to adequately protect environmentally critical areas when approving conditioning or denying applications for public or private development proposals 8 give guidance to the development of comprehensive plan policies in regard to the natural systems and environment of the city watersheds 9 provide property owners and developers with succinct information regarding the citys requirements for property development thus rationalizing and accelerating

proposed on properties containing or adjacent to environmentally critical areas or their defined buffers see section specific requirements shall include siteresource specific reports prepared to describe the environmental limitations of the site these reports shall conform in format and content to guidelines prepared by the department of community development which is hereby authorized to do so  1252011   maps and inventory the approximate location and extent of environmentally critical areas in the city are displayed on various inventory maps available at the department of community development more data will be included as inventories are completed in compliance with the requirements of the growth management act maps and inventory lists are guides to the general location and extent of environmentally critical areas environmentally critical areas not shown are presumed to exist in the city and are protected under all the provisions of this chapter the shoreline jurisdiction areas are identified in the adopted shoreline maps amc  in the event that any of the designations shown on the maps or inventory lists conflict with the criteria set forth in this chapter the criteria and site specific conditions shall control  1252011   dedication of environmentally critical area easements a in order to protect environmentally critical areas environmentally critical area easements or tracts where proposed as mitigation shall be marked as such and dedicated to the city and recorded with snohomish county appropriate demarcation methods shall be as set forth in the public works construction standards and specifications and include appropriate permanent fencing and signage unless otherwise determined by the natural resources manager fencing or demarcation method must be built of materials that are permanent in nature fencing may not be required if the site is a know migration route for wildlife and due to other constraints such as roadways or buildings a fence would prevent migration of those species alternative methods of demarcation will be required to replace signage when determined that effectiveness of signage may be limited b anyone may offer to dedicate an environmentally critical area easement or tract and its buffer to the city even if not proposed as mitigation c such easements or tracts shall cover the environmentally critical area as delineated by their defined boundaries and their buffers d the basic controlling language for such easements shall be as follows though siteresource specific modifications may be made critical area protection easement this open space tract is intended to protect insert eca type and native vegetation and shall preclude grading or any recontouring of the land  placement of structures wells leach fields utility lines andor easements and any other thing  vehicle activity  grazing  dumping  and the addition or removal of vegetation except pursuant to an approved restoration plan and except that

of planning and community development  1252011   dedication of land andor easements in lieu of required parks or open space the dedication of environmentally critical areas and their buffers may not be used for satisfying the park or open space requirements of amc recreational facilities and open space  1252011   increased buffer widths the permitissuing authority shall require increased standard buffer zone widths on a casebycase basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect environmentally critical area functions and values based on local conditions this determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the regulated environmentally critical area such determination shall be attached as a permit condition and shall demonstrate that 1 a larger buffer is necessary to maintain viable populations of existing species  or 2 the environmentally critical area is used by species proposed or listed by the federal government or the state as endangered threatened sensitive candidate or monitor critical or outstanding potential habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees  or 3 the adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than fifteen percent and is therefore susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse environmentally critical area impacts 4 the recommended widths for buffers are based on the assumption that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion or with one that performs similar functions if the existing buffer is unvegetated sparsely vegetated or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided generally improving the vegetation will be more effective than widening the buffer  1252011   buffer width averaging buffer widths may be modified by averaging in no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than twentyfive percent of the standard buffer unless specifically identified in other sections of this chapter buffer width averaging shall be allowed only where the applicant demonstrates all of the following 1 that averaging is necessary to avoid an extraordinary hardship to the applicant caused by circumstances peculiar to the property or that there would be a benefit to the environmentally critical area  2 that the least impactive aspects of the proposed land use would be located adjacent to areas where the buffer width is reduced  3 that width averaging will not adversely impact the environmentally critical area functional values  and 4 that the total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging  1252011   buffers to be retained in natural condition except as otherwise specified all buffers shall be retained in their natural condition where buffer disturbance may or has occurred during construction revegetation with native vegetation will be required  1252011   building setbacks from buffers a building setback of fifteen feet is required from the edge of any critical area buffer as defined in subsequent sections of this chapter minor structural intrusions into the area of the building setback may be allowed if the permitissuing authority determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the environmentally critical area or cause the buffer vegetation to be trimmed or removed the setback shall be identified on the site plan  1252011   reserved   nonconforming activities except for cases of discontinuance as part of normal agricultural practices nonconforming uses shall be governed by of this chapter and amc nonconforming situations  1252011   assessment relief the snohomish county assessors office considers environmentally critical area regulations in determining the fair market value of land any owner of an undeveloped critical area who has dedicated an easement or entered into a perpetual conservation restriction with the city of arlington or a qualified nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in that portion of land assessed consistent with these restrictions shall be considered for exemption from special assessments to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers

provisions set forth at  7182016 mixed use development regulations introduction a purpose under state law local jurisdictions are allowed to define a vision for specific areas within their boundaries and apply regulations and guidelines for implementation of those visions it can establish clear policies implementation strategies and design standards to guide public and private investment in a coordinated manner for the foreseeable future the citys urban growth boundary will remain fixed in its current configuration the immediate effect of an inelastic city edge will be that projected population increases will be absorbed by infilling rather than expansion to maintain the highquality city that is described in the vision statement and comprehensive plan the community will have to take a new look at land use patterns and how it intends guide the built environment local development history has shown that conventional euclidean zoning has not and likely will not provide a path from the vision goals and policies expressed in the comprehensive plan to the creation of quality places mixed use development regulations provides guidance for the creation of quality places that will provide interesting walkable neighborhoods while preserving the citys smalltown feel it is intended to guide initiatives that capitalize on the citys unique assets with the overarching goal of seamlessly accommodating growth the plan is designed to create centers of commercial and residential activity appropriate to local context and use intensities with a predictable built form in addition the plan provides options for developers that result in expedited predictable outcomes b planning with form based place making is a derivative of the concepts and tools contained in the alternative approach to conventional zoning called form based code these concepts reinforce walkable sustainable mixeduse environments and development that builds upon community character this strategic plan uses the form based coding approach to achieve the communitys goals of sustainability and context sensitive highquality infill formbased codes foster predictable built results and a highquality public realm by using physical form rather than separation of uses as the organizing principle for the code these codes are adopted into city or county law as regulations not mere guidelines formbased codes are an alternative to conventional zoning ~ formbased codes institute an important aspect of this definition that differentiates form based codes from conventional zoning is the phrase by using physical form this does not mean that use is not important but instead of land use always being the organizing principle for the overall code within the fbc elements of this plan the intended physical form or characteristics of desired place becomes the primary organizing principle it is also important to note that while fbcs focus on an intended physical form they also regulate use fbcs often allow a range of uses that are carefully chosen to maximize compatibility between uses and the intended physical form of the specific neighborhood fbc components are integrated throughout this plan the following is an explanation of these components and where they are located in this zoning code 1 place types provide the basic building form standards and list the allowed building types sustainable features and permitted uses within a specific geographical area see subsection c15 place types 2 building types provide a fine level of detail about the appropriate massing and form of buildings within a place type see subsection e building types 3 private frontage types provide detail on how a building relates to the street or public realm see subsection d private frontage types 4 thoroughfare types provide the components of a thoroughfare that can be used to create walkable streets that balance the needs of vehicles pedestrians and bicyclists see subsection f block street and rights of way 5 civic spaces provide standards for a broad range of civic spaces and open space a significant focus of the citys new and existing civic spaces will be the creative incorporation of public art see subsection i civic and open space c how to use the plan in graphic form this section illustrates the basic steps to follow in using this form based code as a part of the regulations

mass  frontage types and  architectural features this transect describes six use intensities from natural to suburban to urban core each level of use or tzone has a unique built form consistent with its use intensity and context some jurisdictions have added subtransects some have modified their definitions and some have labelled the intensities with their own vocabulary by whatever method it is described intensity of use is at the core of place definition while transects can be used as a regional planning tool it is uniquely suited to describe the more geographically limited and more intense urban environment this mixed use development overlay plan creates four place type overlay descriptions  neighborhood corridor neighborhood community center neighborhood village center and urban center in addition due to their unique development context two special districts were created special district 1 contains primarily freeway oriented commercial development it is highly unlikely that residential development other than vertical mixed use will become a significant element of growth in this area special district 2 is located in an area where residential use is prohibited therefore its mix of uses will exclude any residential component in addition there are three other areas included in the mixed use overlay but are geographically too small to be assigned a place type growth in these areas will nonetheless be guided by a regulating plan in the citys urban context these place types and special districts articulate in detail the transition from more intense to less concentrated uses each place type contains its own unique combination of neighborhood use transitions as a group these four place types contain all of the commercial residential and civic space use intensities required for the next twenty years because the city is a small urban edge city the two least intense and the one highest intensity transects are not applicable to our future built form  at least not for now zone t3 translates into most of our existing neighborhood and municipal structure zone t4 splits into four use intensities  t4 neighborhood small volume t4 neighborhood medium volume t4 main street and t4 flex a mix of these four intensities is applied to the neighborhood corridor neighborhood community center and neighborhood village center the t5 neighborhood medium volume t5 neighborhood large volume t5 main street and the t5 flex contained in the urban center provides the relatively high intensities of use the city will need to accommodate our projected population and commercial growth the special districts reflect areas with limited or prohibited residential potential and therefore will follow other mixed use patterns remaining within transect regulated intensities in subsection c that follows the individual place types are specifically located within the city in subsection c are the subtransects and definitions appropriate to each place type the specific distribution of subtransects within each place type is accomplished with the city regulating plan the regulating plan is essentially a fine grained zoning map combined with a street plan and an open space plan keyed to the development codes standards and guidelines the regulating plan accomplishes two tasks  based on existing context and projected need and markets the regulating plan locates place type overlays to specific areas of the city and  the regulating plan assigns specific transect and subtransect intensities to individual streets and blocks within each located place type in most of the quality places being created around the country walkability and pedestrian friendliness are basic design criteria the four arlington place types all share these features but in different contexts and with different forms all four have clearly defined centers and edges centers are street intersections in some cases and parks in others edges are defined by either a standard walkable onequartermile or an elongated onehalfmile pedestrian shed as they grow some of the smaller places will overlap others and may at some time in the future become combined to create places of more intense uses and built forms areas that are initially defined as corridors will eventually become a linear series of smaller walkable neighborhoods a pedestrian shed is the basic building block of walkable neighborhoods a ped shed is the area encompassed by the walking distance from a neighborhood center ped sheds are often defined as the area covered by a fiveminute walk about onequarter miles one thousand three hundred twenty feet or four hundred meters they may be drawn as perfect circles but in practice ped sheds have irregular shapes because they cover the actual distance walked not the linear aerial distance a synonym for ped shed is walkable catchment pedestrian safety is greatest when vehicle speeds are low onstreet parking trees and other design elements are a buffer between pedestrians and traffic sidewalks are sized appropriately for the number of walkers buildings meet the street in such a way to make the outdoor rooms that are the mark of the best urban places building faades are human scale with frequent doorways and windows and attractive details and ornament a well designed neighborhood should be pedestrian friendly but also accommodate bicyclists transit riders cars and appropriate delivery and larger vehicles open space and buildings at human scale are an integral part of overall place design density and land use will generally but not always vary from the core to the edge of a neighborhood walkable area in the sections that follow the built environment will be calibrated for each of the four place types based on their unique physical and geographical contexts and their projected use intensities e transect summary zone  t4 neighborhood small volume desired form detached or attached narrow to medium lot widths small to medium footprint

regulations prohibit the inclusion of residential units on airport property this area is ideally suited for a mix of commercial activity that is appropriate to the intensities of adjoining development f the plan area the place types which are specifically allocated are all contained within the existing city limits primarily within highway commercial land use zones there are four major mixed use focus areas each with its own configuration size and unique use intensity combinations there are also two special districts special district1 contains primarily freeway oriented commercial development  special district2 is located in an area where residential use is prohibited therefore its mix of uses will exclude any residential component in addition there are three other areas included in the mixed use overlay but are geographically too small to be assigned a place type growth in these areas will nonetheless be guided by a regulating plan figure a shows the location of the place types special districts and the areas too small for place types figure a g overview of existing conditions during the 2015 comprehensive plan update process it became apparent that to accommodate the twentyyear projected population increase one of two planning regimes had to be followed the first was to increase residential buildable land by simply expanding the citys boundaries the second involved redefining commercially zoned permissible uses to provide for both commercial and residential growth the city is required to accommodate approximately three thousand residential units within the next twenty years currently the land zoned for residential development will provide just over three hundred units there needed to be a plan to account for this shortfall having to meet a variety of conditions the city selected the second option clearly for this option to be viable some alternate regulatory plan for the uses of commercial property needed to be established to enable this option the city subsequently adopted a mixed use overlay that included all the commercial property within its uga computer modeling showed that the application of mixed uses to most of the commercial areas of the city would adequately accommodate both the projected population growth as well as the supporting commercial activity the eventual built form of population absorption by infilling has shown to be unpredictable without design standards organized around some unifying principle this mixed use development regulations incorporates many of the planning and design concepts contained in form based code typically in the development of a form based code careful consideration is given to existing conditions topography existing building typology thoroughfare standards and civic spaces are thoroughly and systematically analyzed to enable the coding of the contextual dna of each affected neighborhood with few exceptions the commercial areas of the city which are contained within the mixed use overlay are either undeveloped or significantly underdeveloped lacking essential neighborhood context the city had to look elsewhere for guidance in the formulation of the citys future built environment the regulations that follow reflect planning for a twentyyear economic and population growth molded primarily by the vision goals and policies of the 2015 arlington comprehensive plan h plan preparation and public participation by february of 201 work had begun on adjustments to the 2015 comprehensive plan update to redraft population absorption strategies and rework a few sections based on department of commerce and puget sound regional council feedback on the original document the city was considering an ordinance to extend mixed use zoning from old town to include all commercially zoned property within its uga recognizing that community input would play a significant role in the definition of these extended mixed use zones the department of community development along with the planning commission formed a focus group to provide guidance for the formulation of the standards that would regulate these new areas the focus group was composed of community leaders from a diverse cross section of the private sector along with city council members and planning commissioners with support from community development staff the group was charged with providing guidance and feedback for the regulation regime and the public outreach program that would ultimately determine the effectiveness and future livability of the mixed use areas the focus group meet weekly for eighteen months initially each meeting was structured in two parts  online planning courses with a focus on form based code followed by a discussion of the tools and processes of fbc and how they might be applied to the new mixed use areas as sections of the draft form based code were developed the focus group provided comments and their suggestions for improvements this feedback became an instrumental part of the editing and updating process as this process was nearing its conclusion the focus group was asked to assist with the development of an outreach program to take the draft fbc regulations out to the community for public feedback the details of the outreach plan that was formulated with focus group feedback are in the appendix three outreach sessions were held in may of 2017 in various locations in the city and another three sessions were held in july in each session there was a presentation of the plan for mixed use development followed by discussion with participants contact information was obtained for future feedback opportunities i goals the citys comprehensive plan divides the city into twelve subareas each of these subareas has a unique built environment a unique mix of uses a unique topography or a combination of all three as the city grows and develops some of these areas will remain relatively stable and some will transition into new looks and new uses the city is going to grow  thats not optional for any washington city the city will need to provide a place for young people entering the labor market inmigration of established workers and their families and homes for a rapidly increasing retired population seven thousand people are coming the quality of the places created for them will directly affect their lives and the lives of people already here most of the growth both in people and in commerce will happen in the transitional neighborhood sub areas these are the places detailed in the regulating plan for the purposes of creating a vision of mixed uses within a design based context these transitional neighborhoods need to be the fundamental unit of city wide planning neighborhoods should be places where people can live work shop and recreate their buildings streets public and private places need to relate well to one another by plan not by accident these neighborhoods should be sized so that an average person can walk from its center to its fringe in five to ten minutes thoroughfare network connectivity is perhaps the single most important element of sustainablybuilt cities the thoroughfare network is simply the system of streets alleys walkways and trails in an area connectivity refers to the directness of travel routes and the number of alternate routes between any two locations vehicular bicycle and pedestrian connectivity in our proposed mixed use neighborhoods are addressed by this urban form development code  12182017   development code a authority and purpose this code protects and promotes the public health comfort safety convenience and general welfare of the community and implements the city comprehensive plan parcels that are subject to regulations of both a specific local place type as contained in this mixed use overlay plan and of its underlying land use zone may be developed using the regulations of either set but not a mixture of the two examples of areas where the overlay plan is an option include the village center at kent prairie the neighborhood corridor along smokey point boulevard the urban center in the smokey point commercial area and the community center at highway 9 and 172 nd  these two sets of regulations represent significantly different approaches to the challenges presented with population absorption by infilling the underlying by right regulations are use based and depend on design guidelines rather than standards to determine the eventual built form this combination rarely produces predictable outcomes for either the developer or for the city applications based on the underlying zoning will follow the administrative processes and regulations described in the relevant portions of this title 20 in particular subdivisions will follow the regulations contained in major and short subdivisions binding site plans will not be available for development governed by the underlying zoning regulations this overlay plan is form based with specific textual and graphic descriptions for the desired outcome along with administrative procedures that represent significant time savings along with a more predictable

by terms such as shall or will 2 guidelines are suggested or encouraged but are not explicitly mandatory however their intent represents an objective for development and as such they are intended to be followed in spirit if not literally thus guidelines leave flexibility for design creativity to meet the intent of the guideline and are promulgated by terms such as should or may 3 the existing
