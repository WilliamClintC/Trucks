which have landslideprone or unstable soils shall have cut slopes not steeper than three horizontal to one vertical unless a soils engineers report recommends up to a maximum of a two horizontal to one vertical slope 2 slopes of less than 25% which are not landslide prone or unstable or have a low probability of being landslide prone shall have a slope not steeper than two horizontal to one vertical unless a satisfactory soils engineers report including core borings is submitted to the township engineer with the grading plan indicating that up to a  slope is structurally sound and

short title this chapter shall be referred to as the sexually oriented business regulation provisions  3422 purpose and findings a purpose 1 pursuant to its inherent authority as a home rule municipality to prohibit nuisances to promote the health welfare cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of peters township hereinafter township and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment amusement and recreation peters township enacts this chapter to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens to protect the citizens from increased crime to preserve the quality of life to preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight 2 the peters township council hereinafter council has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 3 the council does not intend by this chapter to suppress any speech or expression activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses b legislative findings the council finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare the secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity  33745 peters township code  3422 c316 prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration 2 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 3 removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 4 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 5 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses 6 it is desirable for the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 7 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 8 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 9 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  3422 charter  3422 c317

cited as the peters township stormwater management   3712 statement of findings the governing body of peters township generally finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of peters township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  3711 charter  3712 c351  3713 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within peters township washington county by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  3712 of this chapter intended to  3714 statutory authority g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth b manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems c preserve the natural drainage systems to a reasonable and practical extent d maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes h provide procedures performance standards and design criteria for stormwater planning and management i provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and permanent stormwater management facilities and best management practices bmps that are constructed and implemented j provide standards consistent with npdes permit requirements k

habitats 3 the following design objectives shall be considered in the review of any proposed subdivision development within the wp woodland protection residential zoning district a to provide a more environmentally sensitive residential environment by preserving the natural character of stands of trees ponds streams steep slopes and similar natural features  b to preserve the rural landscape and protect environmentally sensitive lands from the disruptive effects of traditional subdivision developments  c to allow a more flexible and environmentally sensitive residential layout and street design   4404032 charter  4404032 c739 d to encourage a less sprawling form of residential subdivision design  e to design construct and maintain all subdivisions so that existing stands of healthy trees and native vegetation of the site are preserved to the maximum extent feasible and are protected by adequate means during construction  and f to blend the residential living units into the
