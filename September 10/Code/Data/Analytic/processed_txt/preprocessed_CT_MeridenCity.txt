efficient planned environmentally and aesthetically sensitive manner along the i691 and i91 corridor further this section is meant to allow the city to compete in the regions growth and take advantage of the citys central location and the sites locale on the interstate highway system this section of the meriden zoning regulations is prescribed by the citys 2009 plan of conservation and development b statement of objectives 1 development within the idd may receive favorable consideration where the following conditions are present and the following objectives are achieved a to accommodate future growth which will enhance the tax base optimum use of appropriate parcels for economic development purposes  b to encourage maximization of building coverage by discouraging excess parking spaces and providing common parking areas  c to provide for the appropriate use of undeveloped land  d to maintain proper mixture of uses to insure overall sustainability  e to protect the existing adjoining residentially zoned neighborhoods by appropriate buffers and by additional landscaping along the perimeter of the zone  f to control strip development and big box development controls and restrictive regulations so as to insure a positive image and to prevent blighting influence  and to encourage application of creative design techniques to foster attractive well planned developments which will be aesthetically integrated with adjacent areas  g to provide appropriate landscaping for green areas and development schemes and enhance natural settings  h to protect the integrity of environmentally sensitive areas  i to facilitate traffic and pedestrian circulation and safety by providing the necessary roadway infrastructure  j to provide for the development of a capital plan for general improvements which insure that the private sector will participate in the financing improvements thereby relieving the public burden  k to provide adequate facilities for sanitary sewerage water supply stormwater drainage and other utilities for the life of the development 2 if any of the conditions noted above are not present when a developer submits an application for development within the idd the planning commission may decide not to give further consideration to the application unless the developer presents adequate evidence of his ability and willingness to correct any condition not meeting these objectives or the official action of the  213431 meriden code  213431  municipal or state agency which will satisfy the condition within a time period acceptable to the planning commission 3 this statement of objectives shall not be subject to variation or exception by any city agency c planning commission authority the planning commission is hereby designated as the agency to administer and enforce this section d applicability the interstate district shall apply only to a tract of property of 55 acres or more contiguous to i691 andor i91 which tract is under single

streets and from any residential zone boundary if the commission determines that the site is suitable for a taller building and that the interstate mixeduse district is enhanced rather than diminished by a taller building to qualify for a height waiver the applicant must demonstrate that the taller building conforms with the following criteria  site location and topography are such that the taller building blends in with its surroundings rather than standing out this criteria will generally be met when the site elevation is substantially lower than the adjacent public streets  the taller

code  213431  floor area  does not include standalone parking structures or parking lots human scaled  site and building design elements that are dimensionally related to pedestrians such as small building spaces with individual entrances eg as is typical of downtowns and main street developments  larger buildings which have articulation and detailing to break up large masses  narrower streets with tree canopies  smaller parking areas or parking areas broken up into small components with landscaping  and pedestrian amenities such as sidewalks plazas outdoor seating shorter light poles usually 10 feet to 14 feet weather protection eg awnings or canopies and similar features these features are all generally smaller in scale than those which are primarily intended to accommodate automobile traffic pedestrian amenities  pedestrian amenities serve as informal gathering places for socializing resting and enjoyment of a particular area and contribute to a walkable center typical amenities include extra wide sidewalks street trees sitting spaces weather protection awnings or canopies pedestrianscale lighting bus stop seating sidewalk dining etc pedestrianfriendlypedestrianoriented  development which is designed with an emphasis primarily on the sidewalk and pedestrian access to and within the site and building rather than on auto access and parking areas the building is generally placed close to the street and the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk there are generally windows or display cases along building facades which face the street strip commercial center  strip commercial centers are typically developed owned and maintained as a unit and have large parking lots in front with manymost of the stores arranged in a straight row and an automobilecentric design proliferation results in a pattern of development wherein commercial development is strung along an arterial thoroughfare m offsite improvements 1 approval
