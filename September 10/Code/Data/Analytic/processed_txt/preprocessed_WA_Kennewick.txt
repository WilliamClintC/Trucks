all public records available except those that are exempt by state or federal statute 4 any person wishing to inspect or copy identifiable public records of the city should make the request in writing

and provides a cheaper and more prompt delivery of responsive records to the customer b by letter fax or email see kmc  for the proper email address addressed to the public records officer individual email accounts are not to be used for submitting public records requests requests submitted to individual email accounts are not permitted as they are not a reliable method to ensure receipt of a

submitted pursuant to this policy and are not considered received under any other manner of submission 8 existing identifiable records a requestor must request an existing identifiable record or class of records before the city must respond to it an identifiable record is one that city staff can reasonably locate requestors are not allowed to search files for records which cannot be reasonably identified or described to the city however a requestor is not required to identify the exact record he or she seeks other information sought from the requestor will be used to determine whether exemptions apply to the request wac 4414040022 a in general an identifiable record is not a request for information for example asking what policies the city has for handling discrimination complaints is merely a request for information a request to inspect or copy the citys policies and procedures for handling discrimination complaints would be a request for an identifiable record zoning inquiries are not requests for public record and are subject to the citys land use permit fee schedule b public records requests are not interrogatories the city is not required to conduct research for a requestor a request for any law that allows the city to impose taxes on me is not a request for an identifiable record conversely a request for all records discussing the passage of this years tax

come into existence at any time after the request is made including those which may come into existence while the request is open 9 no obligation to create records the city is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request however the city may at its discretion create a new record to fulfill the request where it may be easier for the city rather than to collect and make

environmental laws and development regulations has increased for land uses and development so has the number of required land use permits each with its own separate approval process 2 the increasing number of local and state land use permits and separate environmental review processes required by agencies has generated continuing potential for conflict overlap and duplication between the various permit and review processes 3 this regulatory burden has significantly added to the cost and time needed to obtain local and state land use permits and has made it difficult for the public to know how and when to provide timely comments on land use proposals that require multiple permits and have separate environmental review processes    applicability these rules apply to all land use permits under titles 5 15 17 and 18 and to any related regulation implementing these provisions or any other ordinance or law unless another department is the primary agency in a permit process the director of planning administers those chapters and may adopt such rules as will assist in administering these provisions    definitions unless the context clearly requires otherwise the definitions in this section apply throughout this 1 closed record appeal means an administrative appeal on the record following an open record hearing on a project permit application when the appeal is on the record with no or limited new evidence or information allowed to be submitted and only appeal argument allowed 2 director means the director of planning unless another department or agency is in charge of the project permit in which case it refers to the chief administrative officer of that department or agency 3 open record hearing means a hearing conducted by a single hearing body or officer that creates the record submission of evidence and information an open record hearing may be held prior to a decision on a project permit to be known as an open record predecision hearing an open record hearing may be held on an appeal to be known as an open record appeal hearing if no open record predecision hearing has been held on the project permit 4 project permit or project permit application means any land use or environmental permit or license required from the city for a project action including but not limited to building permits subdivisions binding site plans planned unit developments conditional uses shoreline substantial development permits site plan review permits or approvals required by critical area ordinances sitespecific rezones authorized by a comprehensive plan or subarea plan but excluding the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan subarea plan or development regulations except as otherwise specifically included in this subsection 5 public meeting means an informal meeting hearing workshop or other public gathering of people to obtain comments from the public or other agencies on a proposed project permit prior to a decision a public meeting may include but is not limited to a design review or architectural control board meeting a special review district or community council meeting or a scoping meeting on a draft environmental impact statement a public meeting does not include an open record hearing the proceedings at a public meeting may be recorded and a report or recommendation may be included in the local governments project permit application file    purpose in enacting the city council intends to establish a mechanism for implementing the provisions of a rcw regarding compliance conformity and consistency of proposed projects with adopted comprehensive plans and development regulations in order to achieve this purpose the city council finds that 1 given the extensive investment that public agencies and a broad spectrum of the public are making and will continue to make in comprehensive plans and development regulations for their communities it is essential that project review start from the fundamental land use planning choices made in these plans and regulations if the applicable regulations or plans identify the type of land use specify residential density in urban growth areas and identify and provide for funding of public facilities needed to serve the proposed development and site these decisions at a minimum provide the foundation for further project review unless there is a question of code interpretation the project review process including the environmental review process under c rcw and the consideration of consistency should start from this point and should not reanalyze these land use planning decisions in making a permit decision 2 comprehensive plans and development regulations adopted by the city under a rcw and environmental laws and rules adopted by the state and federal government have addressed a wide range of environmental subjects and impacts these provisions typically require environmental studies and contain specific standards to address various impacts associated with a proposed development such as building size and location drainage transportation requirements and protection of critical areas when a permitting agency applies these existing requirements to a proposed project some or all of a projects potential environmental impacts will be avoided or otherwise mitigated through the integrated project review process described in subsection 1 of this the director will determine whether existing requirements including the applicable regulations or plans adequately analyze and address a projects environmental impacts project review should not require additional studies or mitigation under c rcw where existing regulations have adequately addressed a proposed projects probable specific adverse environmental impacts 3 consistency should be determined in the project review process by considering four factors found in applicable regulations or plans the type of land use allowed  the level of development allowed such as units per acre or other measures of density  infrastructure such as the adequacy of public facilities and services to serve the proposed project  and the character of the proposed development such as compliance with specific development standards this uniform approach corresponds to existing project review practices and will not place a burden on applicants or local government the city intends that this approach should be largely a matter of checking compliance with existing requirements for most projects which are simple or routine while more complex projects may require more analysis 4 when an applicant applies for a project permit consistency between the proposed project and applicable regulations or plan should be determined project review process that integrates land use and environmental impact analysis so that governmental and public review of the proposed project by development regulations under a rcw and by the environmental process under c rcw run concurrently and not separately 5 the project review process should address consistency between a proposed project and the applicable regulations or plan a a uniform framework for the meaning of consistency  b an emphasis on relying on existing requirements and adopted standards with the use of supplemental authority as specified by c rcw to the extent that existing requirements do not adequately address a projects specific probable adverse environmental impacts  and c the identification of three basic land use planning choices made in applicable regulations or plans that at a minimum serve as a foundation for project review and that should not be reanalyzed during project permitting    scope of review 1 fundamental land use planning choices made in adopted comprehensive plans and development regulations shall serve as the foundation for project review the review of a proposed projects consistency with applicable development regulations or in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted comprehensive plan under incorporate the determinations under this section 2 during project review the director or any subsequent reviewing body shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project or in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted comprehensive plan at a minimum such applicable regulations or plans shall be determinative of the a type of land use permitted at the site including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances such as planned unit developments and conditional and special uses if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied  b density of residential development in urban growth areas  and c availability and adequacy of public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by a rcw 3 during project review the director shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in subsection 2 of this section including issues of code interpretation 4 the director may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis and mitigation measures in development regulations and other applicable laws provide adequate mitigation for some or all of the projects specific adverse environmental impacts to which the requirements apply 5 nothing in this section limits the authority of the city to approve condition or deny a project as provided in its development regulations adopted under a rcw and in its policies adopted under rcw 4321c060 project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development such as the details of site plans curb cuts drainage swales transportation demand management the payment of impact fees or other measures to mitigate a proposals probable adverse environmental impacts if applicable    project consistency 1 a proposed projects consistency with development regulations adopted under a rcw or in the absence of applicable development regulations the appropriate elements of the comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under a rcw shall be determined by consideration of a the type of land use  b the level of development such as units per acre or other measures of density  c infrastructure including public facilities and services needed to serve the development  and d the character of the development such as development standards 2 in determining consistency the determinations made pursuant to this be controlling 3 for purposes of this the term consistency shall include all terms used in this a rcw to refer to performance in accordance with this a rcw including but not limited to compliance conformity and consistency 4 nothing in this documentation dictates procedures for considering consistency or limits the director from asking more specific or related questions with respect to any of the four main categories listed in subsection 1a d of this    project concurrency 1 concurrency is defined by gma to mean that needed improvements for water sewer and transportation for development proposals are in place at the time of development  or in the case of transportation that a financial commitment exists to complete the improvements within six years 2 the concept of concurrency is based on maintenance of specified levels of service los for water sewer and transportation level of service standards represents the minimum performance level desired for transportation facilities and services and the minimum availability of water and sewer 3 development permit or project permit means any land use permit required from the city for a project action including but not limited to subdivisions site plans designated as tier 2 or tier 3 planned unit developments conditional uses shoreline substantial development permits but excluding nonsite specific development permits such as the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan subarea plan or development regulations 4 the following development permit applications shall be subject to a finding of approval for concurrency conducted in the processing of the development permit application a preliminary plat subdivision of ten or more residential lots  b site plans designated as tier 2 or tier 3  c any other land use plan or permit which would increase the demand for transportation facilities by 50 or more peak hour trips per day based upon the latest ite trip generation manual or other data including los as approved by the citys

the satisfaction of the city traffic engineer or designee a amend the application to reduce the need for capacity improvements of transportation facilities in order to maintain the adopted level of service  or b arrange to provide capacity for transportation facilities that is not otherwise available 6 the following development permits are exempt from this section and applicants may submit applications obtain permits and commence development without a finding of approval for concurrency unless otherwise determined by the director a uses that were disclosed in a completed application filed before the effective date of this section  b any land use plan or permit that would not increase the demand for transportation facilities by more than 50 peak hour trips per day unless the affected transportation facilities are operating at or lower than the adopted levelofservice for the facility  c any land use plan or permit that would increase the demand for potable water andor the demand for sewer requirements by less than those provided within the current water and sewer system plans 7 when required as per kmc 3 the city shall not issue a development permit until a a finding of approval for concurrency has been made in accordance with established transportation water and sewer levels of service and a certificate of concurrency has been issued  or b the application has been determined to be exempt from the concurrency requirement as provided in subsection 6 of this section 8 a finding of approval for concurrency to determine if adequate capacity exists shall be provided by the city traffic engineer or designee for transportation  and for water and sewer by the utilities services manager or designee for developments not otherwise exempt from the requirements

service standards for water and sewer service as adopted in the water and sewer plan and as amended will be used in conducting the concurrency test 11 a finding of approval for concurrency a is valid only for the development permit with which it was issued and for subsequent development permits for the same property as long as the applicant obtains the subsequent development permit and where the use or intensity has not changed and the previous development permit has not expired  and b will be valid for the same period of time as the development permit with which it was issued  and c can be extended for the same time as a development permits extension  and d runs with the land and cannot be transferred to a different property but transfers automatically with ownership of the property

fails 2 prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in kmc 1bi vii and 2 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 3 bypass a for the purposes of this section i bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility ii severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections 3c and d of this section c notice of bypass i if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible ii a user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission

bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d bypass conditions i bypass is prohibited and the potw may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection 3c of this section ii the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three

designation rating and mapping wetlands 1 designating wetlands wetlands are those areas designated in accordance with the washington state wetland identification and delineation manual that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions all areas within the city of kennewick meeting the wetland designation criteria in the identification and delineation manual regardless of any formal identification are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this title 2 wetland ratings wetland types iiv shall be rated according to the department of ecology wetland rating system found in the washington state wetland rating for eastern washington ecology publication #040615 this document contains definitions and methods for determining if specific criteria are met by a particular wetland the city of kennewick contains few wetland areas and most of these have been subject to disturbance in the past the city has evaluated the most significant wetland areas that are known within the city limits and its urban growth boundary under the ecology rating system these include the wetlands associated with elliot lake zintel canyon drainage way wetlands around 36th and olympia and 27th and washington  and wetlands within columbia park and the columbia river shoreline zone including duffys pond near clover island these wetlands all classify as category iii wetlands this effort leads the city to believe that any additional wetlands that may occur within the city limits will rank as category iii wetlands or as category iv wetlands and that it is unlikely that higher quality wetlands occur in the city of kennewick provisions have been provided for category i and ii wetlands should there be a future determination these exist in kennewick the ecology wetland rating system for eastern washington ecology 2004 defines category iii wetlands as those wetlands that are 1 vernal pools that are isolated and 2 wetlands with a moderate level of functions scores between 30 and 50 points  and category iv wetlands are considered to be wetlands that have the lowest level of functions scores less than 30 points and are often heavily disturbed 3 mapping the approximate location and

as the buffer required for the category of the created restored or enhanced wetland    performance standardsmitigation requirements when the acreage required for compensatory mitigation is divided by the acreage of impact the result is a number known variously as a replacement compensation or mitigation ratio compensatory mitigation ratios are used to help ensure that compensatory mitigation actions are adequate to offset unavoidable wetland impacts by requiring a greater amount of mitigation area than the area of impact requiring greater mitigation area helps compensate for the risk that a mitigation action will fail and for the time lag that occurs between the wetland impact and achieving a fully functioning mitigation site 1 definitions of types of compensatory mitigation the ratios presented are based on the type of compensatory mitigation proposed eg restoration creation and enhancement in its regulatory guidance letter 0202 the us army corps of engineers provided definitions for these types of compensatory mitigation for consistency the authors of this document use the same definitions which are provided under compensatory mitigation in table 4 mitigation ratios for projects in kennewick category and type of wetland impacts reestablishment or creation rehabilitation only 4 reestablishment or creation rc and rehabilitation rh reestablishment or creation rc and enhancement e 4 enhancement only 4 all category iv 1   rc and  rh  rc and  e  all category iii    rc and  rh  rc and  e  all category ii and i    rc and  rh  rc and  e  4 these ratios are based on the assumption that the rehabilitation or enhancement actions implemented represent the average degree of improvement possible for the site proposals to implement more effective rehabilitation or enhancement actions may result in a lower ratio while less effective actions may result in a higher ratio the distinction between rehabilitation and enhancement is not clearcut instead rehabilitation and enhancement actions span a continuum proposals that fall within the gray area between rehabilitation and enhancement will result in a ratio that lies between the ratios for rehabilitation and the ratios for enhancement 2 mitigation maintenance and monitoring mitigation areas will be maintained and monitored for a minimum of five years after the mitigation has been completed annual maintenance

kennewick shoreline master program intends to implement the requirements of the washington state shoreline management act sma revised washington rcw 9058 the sma was enacted in 1971 to provide for the management and protection of shorelines of the state by regulating development in the shoreline area the goal of the sma is to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines the sma requires cities and counties to adopt a shoreline master program under rules established by the washington department of ecology ecology to regulate shoreline development and accommodate all reasonable and appropriate uses consistent with protection against adverse effects to the public health the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life and public rights of navigation the city of kennewick adopted its shoreline master program in 1974 ecology adopted the 2003 shoreline management act guidelines washington

in a manner that will provide for the orderly development of clover island and areas adjacent to the corps of engineers levee in a harmonious manner which accentuates and enhances lake wallula 2 public access element on clover island improve public access to designated areas of lake wallula for recreational uses as indicated in the clover island high intensity special area plan standards appendix a6 maintain areas along columbia park the levee and duffys pond by which the public can reach lake wallula and duffys pond for fishing viewing and other public access purposes maintain access to the park and levee using pedestrian and bicycle bridges 3 recreational element enhance the recreational facilities potential of the shorelines clover island recreational uses should complement existing and proposed developments maintain and enhance recreational facilities along columbia park and the levee to provide diversification in recreational uses 4 circulation element circulation to the levee and the clover island causeway should be improved for ease of access and should include adequate offstreet parking facilities to serve the people who will be using area for recreational and commercial purposes maintain and enhance where appropriate circulation and access within columbia park 5 shoreline use element assure that the various land uses are compatible and aimed toward maximum utilization without diminishing the quality of the environment shorelines abutting the levee area should take advantage of the presence of lake wallula and should be oriented in a manner to coordinate lakefront uses and nonlakefront uses 6 conservation element enhance the aesthetic characteristics and environmental functions and values of the levee duffys pond clover island and columbia park areas and take necessary steps to conserve the natural setting of those shoreline areas which are presently in an undeveloped state 7 history scientific and cultural element establish areas on or near the levee and columbia park which will have a cultural educational historical or scientific value and protect these areas in a proactive and substantive way 8 flood prevention element assure that whenever feasible steps are taken to prevent andor minimize the risk of flood and associated flood damages to property and land uses    policiesenvironment designation of shorelines 1 the city of kennewick environment designation ed classification system consists of three shoreline environments these environment designations have been established based on the findings in the shoreline inventory and assessment report of 2005 the delineation of each environment has been aimed to assure the protection of existing shoreline ecological functions such designations are consistent with policies for restoration of degraded shorelines and aquatic and riparian habitat enhancement the three shoreline environments are a aquatic  b clover island high intensity  and c urban conservancy 2 these shoreline environments are based on those provided in the state guidelines and include designation criteria and management policies that recognize the unique characteristics of kennewick and specific areas of the shoreline the areas within each environment are publically owned 3 the boundary of the designated shoreland areas shall be governed by the criteria set forth in rcw  and wac 17322040 except that the city will amend the shoreline master program to reflect the new designation within three years of the discovery of any discrepancy 4 all areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are not mapped andor designated are automatically assigned an urban conservancy environment designation until the shoreline can be redesignated shoreline master program amendment 5 the following policies apply to lands falling under the respective environment designation a aquatic environment i purpose the purpose of the aquatic environment is to protect restore and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark ii management policies a new overwater structures are allowed only for waterdependent uses public access or ecological restoration wac 173262115ciia b the size of new overwater structures shall be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structures intended use c in order to reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources multiple uses of overwater facilities are encouraged d all developments and uses on navigable waters or their beds shall be located and designed to minimize interference with surface navigation to consider impacts to public views and to allow for the safe unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife particularly those species dependent on migration e uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical freshwater habitats shall not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of rcw  and then only when their impacts are mitigated according to the sequence described in appendix a2 critical areas and consistent with this shoreline master program and rcw 9058 the shoreline management act as necessary to assure no net loss of ecological functions f shoreline uses shall be designed and managed to minimize degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions iii designation criteria a the aquatic environment designation is assigned to lands within the city that are located waterward of the ordinary high water mark b clover island high intensity environment i purpose a the purpose of the clover island high intensity environment is to continue to provide economic development and recreation opportunities that add to the existing water dependent uses and public access and view opportunities via a mix of highintensity wateroriented and nonwateroriented commercial multifamily residential and transportation uses while providing additional public access improved aesthetic quality enhanced aquatic and nearshore ecological functions and maintaining view corridors consistent with the clover island high intensity special area plan standards appendix a6 ii management policies a the clover island high intensity environment has been determined by the city to be a special area plan per wac 173262115diia and 173262013dix the clover island master plan goals objectives and master plan elements are consistent with the goals policies and objectives of the citys shoreline master program it is intended that the detail outlined in this kmc 1868 and development enhancement and public access standards provided in appendix a6 will control development on clover island b the clover island high intensity special area plan standards and this shoreline master program give priority to waterdependent uses the city recognizes the many existing clover island waterdependent uses including but not limited to existing marinas boat launch boat docks and the fuel
