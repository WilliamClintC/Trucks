is adopted under the authority of of the massachusetts constitution the home rule amendment mgl c 93  29 and all other authority conferred by the general laws as amended a the authority for control of all signs is delegated to the sign commission subject to the general laws no signs are allowed on or above any public way or on private property within public view of a public way public park or reservation in the town except lawful traffic regulation devices or except as hereinafter provided b the williamstown envisioned under this chapter is one with major patterns of use and general appearance little changed from today but with greater opportunities within the community for a broader range of diversity of citizens and businesses  a town not only undamaged by change but made better a economic growth appropriate to williamstowns character is actively sought not as an end to itself but as a means of broadening the diversity of opportunity in williamstown in turn supporting a rich and diverse community life and population there is room enough for all the development which realistically the town can expect to experience without the defacing of its special assets and places including both natural and manmade features rural vistas and historic monuments b the basic form of williamstown is that of a classic new england town with a strong central village sharply contrasting with and benefiting from the openness of the surrounding lands the present arrangement works well for almost everyone it provides wonderful living possibilities within easy walk of both central services and open lands it organizes development in an easily serviced way it creates a visually rich and satisfying community character c there is little doubt williamstown residents intend the policies of the sign commission to enhance these qualities such conflicts within the community as the sign commission may encounter should be reconciled with this public vision in mind it is instructed to use incentives and rewards wherever possible as a way of implementing sign policy however the following guidelines are intended to be as clear and unambiguous as possible the primary function of onpremise signs is to index the environment to tell people where they can find what selling is a subordinate purpose 1 d  5311 general provisions  5312   5313 purpose the purposes of this chapter are 2 signs should be expressive of the individual proprietors identity signs should be appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain 3 signs should be compatible with the visual character of the area surrounding them carved signs are compatible in all areas and this chapter encourages their use 4 signs should be legible in the circumstances in which they are seen 5 a to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the towns ability to attract tourism and other sources of economic development and growth b c to improve pedestrian and traffic safety to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property d to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of sign

article iii submission and approval of plans  17031 review process project types there are four subdivision types each with its own set of procedures minor lane residential development entails simplified procedures for certain subdivisions of not more than three lots 1 major residential development requirements of zoning apply to all residential subdivisions of more than eight lots  a special permit is required 2 nonresidential subdivision differs procedurally from residential subdivision in that massachusetts law requires nonresidential subdivisions to go preliminary plan while for residential developments that is optional 3 a standard project would be one of not more than eight lots in a residential district not seeking the minor lane residential development procedural exemptions 4 a applicant team all parties benefit if the subdivision is considered in all its elements from the start applicants are encouraged to involve from the beginning not only the land surveyor and engineer legally required for subdivision filing but also related development professionals such as wetland scientists architects and landscape architects who will eventually be retained to help in meeting the design guidelines of this chapter to assure integration of land planning site planning and building design b relationship to zoning  major residential developments major residential developments as defined by zoning more than eight lots will require a special permit the special permit and the subdivision plan approval under this chapter are both acted upon by the planning board while there is no mandated sequencing between the special permit and subdivision actions in the usual case the following will be appropriate presubmission review to discuss informally the entire approach a preliminary subdivision plan submittal and special permit application simultaneously information requirements for both are at a comparable level of specificity and each provides information for the other b special permit and preliminary plan decisions each of which may include conditions which impact how the definitive plan is to be shaped c 1 c  17031 general provisions  17031   17032 presubmission review before investing in extensive professional design efforts for subdivision plans and their formal submittal it will often prove useful to review informally the proposed development of a parcel of land with the planning board in order that general approaches choice of subdivision type possible use of minor lane residential development procedures and potential problems can be freely explored simple sketches which need not be professionally prepared will assist the discussion and might show some but not all of the information shown on a preliminary plan in some cases this presubmission review may eliminate the need for a preliminary plan  17033 preliminary plan d definitive plan submittal e definitive plan decision which also may impose conditions decision deadline extensions and conditional approvals will be used to reconcile any relational difficulties imposed by statutory timing rules 2 relationship to zoning  minor lane residential development minor lane residential developments must obtain a special permit from the planning board prior to definitive plan approval of the minor lane by the planning board the suggested sequence of special permit and definitive plan actions are the same as that for major residential developments listed in above d when preliminary plan is required a preliminary plan of a subdivision must be submitted for any

in appendix a or shall be divided into subareas each of which is designed to be consistent with one of these types village village subdivisions are appropriate within or adjacent to densely developed areas or where a future village center is proposed they are intended to continue the pattern of traditional development in light of relatively small lots and short frontages drainage systems will be closed and sidewalks and granite curbs will be installed 1 gathering gathering subdivisions are intermediate between village and dispersed such as in the developed portion of a subdivision having low overall density but clustered lots drainage will usually be closed but sidewalks will be required only in certain cases curbing if provided need not be vertical granite the road edge may sometimes be a grass berm 2 dispersed dispersed subdivisions involve large lots and long frontages so drainage may normally be open streets may be without curbs or berms and sidewalks are required only in special
