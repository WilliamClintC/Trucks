advantages especially for abundant supplies from the surrounding country he remained here until january 1781 when here lord cornwallis marquee was near the oak in front of mount zion college after inquiry general sherman in february 186 placed his marquee upon the same spot during the revolution a large military hospital was situated upon the premises now occupied by mr george h mcmaster and was used by both armies in turn the british dead were buried in his front yard and the americans in rear extending to where the tombs of captain james mitchell and of lt coland the tumulus over his

response management area of this state 1the system serves approximately 9500 people throughout the county by way of 3612 residential taps and 585 commercial taps the town also serves a secondary population of 3400 people by way of two mastermeter connections therefore the total population served is 12900 people 2a brief description of the layout of the water system follows the primary raw water intake is located on mill creek reservoir a 192acre lake that is owned by the town there is a threelevel intake structure and the raw pumps are located at the end of a concrete pier both variable speed raw water pumps are 300 hp vertical turbine pumps rated at 2777 gpm and 40 mgd a new pump station has been recently added at the rion rock quarry for recharging the mill creek reservoir a new pump station in this same quarry is under construction at this time in addition there is another supplemental raw water source for the town this is the sand creek pump station this source has a 65 mgd withdrawal rate and is used to reduce the withdrawal rate from the reservoir 3there are two onsite finished water storage clearwells at the plant one is a rectangular 230000gallon tank and the other is a round 200000gallon tank from these water is pumped into the distribution system there are seven storage tanks throughout the distribution system ranging in size from 75000 gallons to 875000 gallons didentification of water system specific drought or water shortage indicators operators of every water system must develop historical trends that are valuable indicators of a systems ability to meet demand when demand begins to outpace supply the town has developed triggers for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of the drought response ordinance are implemented the system triggers are as follows 1moderate drought phase areservoirs are 80% full  bstorage falls below 25% of capacity  and cstream flow is less than 28 cubic feet per second 2severe drought phase areservoirs are 65% full  bstorage falls below 35% of capacity  and cstream flow is less than 17 cubic feet per second 3extreme drought phase areservoirs are 50% full  bstorage falls below 45% of capacity  and cstream flow is less than 10 cubic foot per second ealternative water supply sources successful drought management requires a comprehensive program by the water utility the town identifies the following alternative water sources the old town reservoir which is located adjacent to the current town reservoir sand creek pumping station and rion quarry #1 and #2 together these alternate water supplies yield approximately 11 billion gallons of water the old town reservoir and both quarry pits are piped directly into the existing town reservoir these sources are utilized when the level in the reservoir drops and is not being replenished fast enough to offset the water demand the sand creek pumping station can be pumped directly to the water plant or into the reservoir fdescription of predrought planning efforts before the occurrence of a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of the ordinance it is important that certain preresponse measures be taken with the aim of conserving the systems source water as well as the water distributed to the customer 1actions taken in regards to the conservation measures listed below the town has taken the following actions aidentification of all major water users of the system town of ridgeway and midcounty water system  bidentification of those users with whom there are conservation agreements once the drought ordinance is issued these users are contacted and asked to inform their users to conserve water town of ridgeway and midcounty water system  and ca vigorous public education program is critical for achieving substantial water use reductions an effective public outreach program will keep the public informed about the water supply situation what actions will mitigate drought emergency problems and how well the public is doing in terms of meeting the program goals keeping the public involved informed and participating in the decisionmaking process is key to implementing an effective drought management plan 2description of the utilitys efforts to develop an effective droughtrelated public education program the town has a local access channel on the fairfield communications cable network drought information is posted on this channel and customers are kept informed of the actions of the state drought committee as well as what measures the town is taking to conserve or limit water use in addition press releases are run in the local paper the heraldindependent to ensure the public stays informed of the drought gcapital planning and investment 1description of capital planning and investment for system reliability and demand forecasting water utilities routinely find that capital improvements to the system strongly enhance their ability to get of drought it is important that every water utility aggressively plan and build for future needs the utility must continue to provide for system operation flexibility improved pumping and storage capacity and new technologies to meet the demands of tomorrow 2description of the utilitys capital improvement program and how past efforts have enhanced the systems ability to meet demand during drought conditions the town water treatment plant adjusts the schedule as necessary in order to meet the demands of the customers during times of extreme hot weather and higher than usual water consumption the operators at the treatment plant are prepared to run a 24hour schedule in order to meet the demands of the system the town is currently constructing two new water tanks that will allow for increased storage capacity the town actively pursues grants and any funding that will allow for the upgrade and maintenance of the water distribution system there are currently plans underway to enlarge the raw water capacity from the reservoir to the treatment plant once this new line is installed the treatment plant capacity will reach 40 mgd in addition the town also has a capital improvement plan underway to upgrade the telemetry system for the entire distribution system this new system will allow better control over the water levels in each tank and immediate feedback from pumps and tanks in the distribution system hdescription of other system improvements the utility should consider to prepare for future droughts and increasing water demands 1in order to prepare for future droughts the water distribution department needs to continue its preventive maintenance program in order to identify any leaking pipes meters hydrants or valves that would lead to loss of water in the distribution system  and 2in order for the water treatment plant to be able to supply and treat a higher volume of water once the new raw water line has been installed the plant will more than likely have to be upgraded personnel are currently evaluating the filter system at the plant in order to determine if an upgrade will be necessary in order to treat larger amounts of water passed 632003  5343 drought response ordinance  policy and authority athe objective of the drought response ordinance codified as  5343 is to establish authority policy and procedure by which the town will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a droughtrelated shortage the ordinance satisfies the requirements of the drought response act of 200 being sc et seq and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use sanitation and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner bthis subchapter outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the town these actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply cto satisfy these goals the town hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water this subchapter is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the town dif it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought the town is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water use demands the proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water use for human consumption sanitation fire protection and other essential needs becomes endangered eimmediately upon issuance of this proclamation regulations and restrictions set forth under this subchapter shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded fwater uses that are regulated or prohibited under this subchapter are considered to be nonessential and continuation of the uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water subjecting the offenders to penalties passed 632003 editors note the ordinance codified as  5343 officially approved the drought management plan of  5342  5344 moderate drought phase aupon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist andor upon determination by the town that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels the town will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods specifically the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of 20% in residential water use and 15% in other water uses such as commercial industrial institutional and irrigation  and a reduction in overall water use of 15% bto accomplish this the town will take the following actions 1issue a proclamation to be released to local media town customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that

development of large sites subject to specific regulations concerning permitted uses but only subject to regulations concerning lot area building coverage yard spaces and building height in so far as the town council shall deem appropriate to fulfill the intent of this upon presentation of certification from the owners developers or other parties of interest in the development of such sites that they will adhere to development policies which will fulfill the intent of this types of planned development districts three types of planned development districts accommodating primarily residential

such districts as secondary uses 3 pdm planned development  mixed use 46 the pdm is intended to accommodate a variety of mixed uses with both residential and commercial uses integrated into a design which follows neotraditional neighborhood design standards where both types of uses of such district are primarily uses typically on the same lot intent the types of residential dwelling units and the types of nonresidential uses allowed to be established in such districts increase with the increasing site size of such districts based upon the premise that increased site size will allow proper design including functional interrelations buffer treatments separating uses with potentially incompatible characteristics of uses within such planned development districts with uses in adjacent

establish requirements for placement installation and maintenance of business and advertising signs in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens as regulation of placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the police power so too is regulation of placement installation and maintenance of signs since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings regulation of placement installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by their purpose which is to draw mental attention to them potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and to the safety of the motoring public to which a majority of signs are oriented therefore it is the intent of this regulate the size and location of business and advertising signs so that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions finally it is the objective of this protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating placement installation and maintenance of signs the fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact grants to business and advertising signs a proportionately greater role that other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community the aesthetic impact of business and advertising signs is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property  therefore the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality it is contended that it is not irrational for a communitys citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized 82 definitions in addition to the definitions set forth in of this
