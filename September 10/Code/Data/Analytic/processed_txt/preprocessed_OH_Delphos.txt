ordinances of delphos ohio  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the

for estimating runoff the total watershed that produces stormwater runoff across the site being developed shall be included when estimating flood discharge runoff dependent on watershed size three principle methods shall be used to estimate design discharge 1 for small watersheds of 25 acres or less the design runoff shall be determined by the rational method this method is also used for catch

county area this curve relating the expected rainfall intensity in inches per hour to the storm duration in minutes is expressed in tabular form on table a and shall be used to estimate design discharges the ten year values can be converted to other recurrence years by applying the following factors  to convert tomultiply table value by 1 year frequency 055 2 year frequency 067 5 year frequency 086 10 year frequency 100 25 year frequency 121 50 year frequency 143 time of concentration one of the basic assumptions underlying the rational method is that runoff is a function of the average rainfall rate during the time required for water to flow from the most remote part of the drainage area under consideration to the design point the time of concentration determines the average rainfall rate on the rainfall intensitydurationfrequency curve four urban storm sewers the time of concentration consists of an inlet time or time required for runoff to flow over the surface to the nearest inlet and time of flow in the sewer to the point under consideration inlet time will vary with surface slope depression storage surface cover antecedent rainfall and infiltration capacity of soil as well as distance of surface flow pipe flow time can be calculated by mannings formula overland flow paths should not be taken perpendicular to contours on proposed subdivisions since the land will be graded and swales will often intercept the natural contour conducting water to the street in less time inlet time or the initial time of concentration for overland flows can be estimated from
