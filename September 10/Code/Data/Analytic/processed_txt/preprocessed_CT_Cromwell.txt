period in accordance with a master sewer plan established by the sewer authority or in an area that is to be serviced by a sewer system that has been designed but not constructed the developer shall be required to connect his proposed sewer system to said public sewer if in the opinion of the sewer authority such connection is impractical because of the location of the proposed development in relation to the public sewer or because the capacity of said public sewer cannot accommodate the projected flow from such development the authority may by resolution waive said requirement to connect to said public sewer when the authority is of such opinion it shall notify the developer that 1 he is released from the requirement to provide a public sewer system for his proposed development  2 he

indicators a direct indicators the wildlife species listed below require vernal pools for successful reproduction and are therefore considered obligate vernal pool species they serve as direct indicators of the existence of a vernal pool ecosystem and are the primary beneficiaries of vernal pool ecosystem protection documentation of vernal pool use by these species is the best way to identify vernal pool ecosystems either of the following categories will verify the existence of a vernal pool ecosystem 1 category 1 the existence of a seasonal watercourse in a confined basin or depression that lacks a fish population and shows evidence of breeding or development by any of the following amphibian obligate species spotted salamander  marbled salamander  wood frog  jefferson salamanderbluespotted salamander complex as required by this definition acceptable proof of breeding or development of these obligate species include one or more of the following items breeding a breeding adults 1 wood frogs breeding chorus andor mated pairs  2 obligate salamanders courting individuals andor spermatophores b two or more egg masses of any of the abovenamed species development c tadpoles or larvae of the above species  d transforming juveniles 1 wood frogs tail stubs evident  2 obligate salamanders gill remnants evident 2 category 2 the existence of a seasonal watercourse in a confined basin or depression that lacks a fish population and contains fairy shrimp or their eggs b indirect indicators in the absence of direct indicators typically when the pool is dry from late summer fall or during the winter indirect indicators may be used to gauge the likelihood that a watercourse is capable of supporting 18 obligate species the more indirect indicators there are especially indirect indicators 1  the greater the likelihood that a particular watercourse is a vernal pool a defined depression or basin should be examined for the following indirect indicators 1 fingernail clam shells snail shells caddis fly cases diving beetles or evidence of other aquatic invertebrates among the leaf litter  2 presence of algal strands hanging over branches or siltstained leaves  3 dense wetland plant growth eg buttonbush burrreed etc in the interior of the basin or depression  4 a distinct waterline on the base of tree trunks or shrubs in the basin  items 1 are strong indicators indicating that the pool holds water long enough to support breeding by obligate species 5 discolored waterstained gray leaf litter within the basin as distinguished from the brown leaves on the adjacent upland floor  6 hummocks supporting moss grass sedges or woody growth along the edge of the basin or depression  7 unvegetated lowlying area or areas in the basin interior  8 standing water or ice in winter items 5 are moderate indicators that might signify the presence of a vernal pool but do not provide strong evidence that the pool holds water long enough to support breeding obligate species 712 for any permit application involving property subject to a conservation restriction or preservation restriction the following shall apply a for purposes of this section
