wetland overlay district subd 1 findings intent and incorporation by reference a the city has determined that wetlands serve to maintain water quality by filtering water that is discharged into ground water aquifers and by retaining inorganic sediments toxicants and nutrients they also retain and reduce the discharge of phosphorus and transform nutrients from their inorganic to organic forms thereby protecting streams and water bodies from eutrophication and contamination wetlands also store runoff and reduce the velocity and magnitude of flood peaks b wetland vegetation also prevents the erosion of shoreline areas wetland vegetation provides food shelter and important habitat for wildlife all of these wetland characteristics provide valuable recreation and education resources c the city has also found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered wetlands within the city exhibit great variations in their floral diversity quality of wildlife and fishery habitat degree of fluctuation in response to storms the extent to which their shorelines have been altered or eroded and their relative value in protecting water quality therefore the city has found it necessary and beneficial to classify wetlands based upon their functions and values the city has also found that it is in the best interest of the general health and welfare of the city to achieve no net loss of wetlands within the community d the city recognizes that a substantial amount of wetland degradation results from sedimentation and nutrient loading related to construction projects therefore the city finds it necessary to require extraordinary measures to prevent such construction related degradation e in addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the city also finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of lands surrounding wetlands buffer strips are necessary and beneficial to maintaining the health of wetlands these strips of land surrounding wetlands protect their shorelines from erosion while serving to filter sediment chemicals and other nutrients before the storm water discharges into the wetland buffer strips are also beneficial in providing habitat for wildlife f this incorporates by reference the wetlands conservation act of 1991 minn stat 103g221 et seq hereinafter referred to as the wca and any future amendments adopted by the legislature all overlay districts   wetlands as defined in this including those governed by the department of natural resources are covered by the other provisions of this there are circumstances under which the strict enforcement of these regulations may be unreasonable and in circumstances that meet the criteria established in subd 5 of this departures from the strict application of these standards may be permitted g it is the intent of this avoid the alteration and destruction of wetlands when wetlands are altered or destroyed the mitigation must be provided to recreate the functions and values of the wetland subd 2 purpose and implementation a through the adoption and enforcement of this the city shall promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation as provided for in the wca when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this the city seeks to accomplish the following purposes 1 to satisfy the requirements of the wca as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city  2 to balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city  3 to preserve the natural character of the landscape maintenance of wetland ecosystems  4 to promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water to retain sediment and toxicants and filter nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into community lakes and streams thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features  and 5 to provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city b to accomplish these purposes the city 1 has conducted an inventory of wetlands and other natural areas within the city  overlay districts   2 has developed a system of classification for wetlands within the city and classified the citys wetlands based upon their relative values related to floral diversity wildlife habitat water quality protection fishery habitat flood storage shoreline protection and aesthetic recreational and educational benefits using the minnesota rapid assessment mnram methodology  3 has prepared and maintains a comprehensive set of official maps identifying the location and classification of wetlands inventoried in the natural resources inventory  4 has established wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood plain and shoreland protection regulations  5 requires sound management practices to protect conserve maintain enhance and improve the quality of wetlands within the community  6 enforces standards for the alteration of wetlands when alteration is allowed including standards and procedures for the mitigation of the loss of wetland areas and their functions and values when alteration or destruction occurs  7 obtains protective easements over or acquires fee title to wetlands as appropriate  8 educates the public about the numerous benefits and features that wetland provide and the adverse effects of improperly managed development on wetlands subd 3 general provisions a identification and delineation of wetlands 1 this apply to all land containing wetlands and land within the setback and buffer areas required by this shall be subject to the requirements established herein as well as restrictions and requirements established by other applicable federal state and city ordinances and regulations these wetland protection regulations shall not be construed to allow anything otherwise prohibited in the zoning district where the wetland is located 2 a wetland is land that meets the definition of wetlands set forth in classification of a wetland shown on the natural resource communities quality ranking map will be prima facie evidence of the classification of a wetland overlay districts   3 the presence or absence of a wetland on the official maps does not represent a definitive determination as to whether a wetland covered by this or is not present wetlands that are identified during site specific delineation activities but do not appear on the official wetland maps are still subject to the provisions of the that appear on the official wetland maps as wetlands that are not identified as wetlands during site specific delineation activities are not subject to the provisions of this it will be the responsibility of an applicant for required city approvals or permits to delineate the exact wetland boundary or to determine that no wetland exists on a subject property all delineations must be reviewed and approved by the city or its delegated authority 5 if an applicant questions whether a wetland exists or disputes its classification on the official map the applicant shall have the burden to supply detailed information for review supporting the applicants assertion including but not limited to topographic hydrologic floristic andor soil data deemed necessary by the city to determine the jurisdictional status of the wetland its exact boundary and its classification wetland delineations supplied by applicants shall be certified by a qualified wetland delineator wetland delineators must satisfy any certification requirements that may be established by the us army corps of engineers or the minnesota board of water and soil resources 6 applicants seeking a change in wetland classification must submit to the city a completed mnram version 10 form or the most recent version the technical evaluation panel will review the request for change the technical evaluation panel will make a recommendation to the city regarding a change in classification 7 only that portion of a property within the boundaries of a wetland shall be subject to the provisions of this this three wetland classifications as defined in high quality medium quality and low quality subd 4 general standards the following standards apply to all lands within andor abutting a wetland a septic and soil absorptions systems must be setback a minimum of 75 feet from the city approved boundary of the wetland overlay districts   b the lowest ground floor elevation shall be 2 feet above the 100year flood elevation or three feet above the ordinary high water mark of public waters regulated by whichever is greater c structures intended to provide access across a wetland shall be prohibited unless a permit is obtained in conformance with state regulations d the mpcas best management practices shall be followed to avoid erosion and sedimentation during the construction process e city inspection schedules and fines for erosion control will double on projects abutting wetlands f before the city issues a building permit for a lot with a required wetland buffer the lot owner shall 1 record a notice of the wetland buffer requirement against the title to the lot with the office of the hennepin county recorder or registrar of titles and 2 install the wetland monuments required by subd 7 of this  wetland buffer strips and setbacks a for lots of record created after  a buffer strip shall be maintained abutting all wetlands identified in subd 3 below the setback and buffer provisions of this not apply to lots of record on  to developments for which conditional use permits site plans and preliminary plats final plats or preliminary or final planned unit development plans have been approved by the city within 2 years prior to  or to developments for which complete applications for any of the above actions have been accepted by the city for review but not yet acted upon prior to  the city does however strongly encourage the use of a wetland buffer and setback on all lots in the city b wetland buffer strips and structure setbacks shall apply to all parcels of land whether or not the wetland is on the same parcel as a proposed development overlay districts   c wetland buffer strips are required on wetland sizes and types as follows wetland buffers and setback requirements high medium low wetland buffer average width 50 25 15 wetland buffer width min 40 20 10 wetland buffer width max 60 40 20 structure setback from buffer 15 15 15 total buffer and setback average 65 40 30 buffer widths in excess of the listed maximums shall not be used in calculating average buffer width these setbacks shall take precedence over other setbacks required in this setbacks apply to structures onlya 5foot setback is required for roads and parking lots trails that serve an interpretive function may be exempted from buffer and setback requirements example of buffer and setback applied to a high quality wetland d notwithstanding the foregoing wetland buffer strips are not required for 1 a wetland if minnesota statutes subdivision 4 5 or 9 would exempt the draining or filling of that wetland from the replacement plan requirements of minnesota statutes or 2 a wetland that is a type 1 2 or 6 wetland as defined in minnesota statutes subdivision 17b and that is located outside the natural resources corridors identified on official city maps overlay districts   e buffer strip vegetation shall be established and maintained in accordance with the requirements found in this subdivision during the first 2 years any buffer vegetation that does not survive must be replanted after 2 years if the condition of the buffer area changes processes not caused by the property owner the owner shall not be required to reestablish the buffer area to meet the standards contained in subd 8 of this strips shall be identified within each lot by permanent monuments approved by the city f for roadways that must be aligned either adjacent to or across wetlands and are subject to wca replacement requirements additional wetland filling to create a buffer strip shall not be required trails that the city has determined serve an interpretive function may also be exempted from the buffer requirement all other roadways and trails shall meet the buffer standards established in this subd or in subd 6 below g if the area of the buffer has a preconstruction slope of 12 percent or greater the buffer shall be at the applicable maximum for width for the wetland classification the use of a meandering buffer stripe to maintain a natural appearance is encouraged but not required in areas of flat topography h the required structure setback shall apply to all structures except that such structure setback shall be reduced to 5 feet for roadways trails and parking lots and their related retaining walls and fences i wetland buffer strips not required by this be voluntarily created in conformance with the requirements of this with approval of a site plan or in the absence of a site plan upon approval of an administrative permit subd 6 alternative wetland buffer strips and setbacks with extraordinary management measures a
