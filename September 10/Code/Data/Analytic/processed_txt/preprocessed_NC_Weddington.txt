advance the legitimate needs of their citizens  2 as legislators who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting ordinances orders and resolutions  3 as decisionmakers

accordingly f board members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents each official must find within his

surrounding the board members action would conclude that the action was inappropriate b if a board member believes that his or her actions while legal and ethical may be misunderstood the member should seek the advice of the town attorney and should consider publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it such as consulting with the attorney  performance of

the town council may grant an exception to the requirement for a marginal access street in granting said exception the town council shall find that the spirit and intent of this chapter are preserved and that circumstances particular to the subject property such as topography or shape of the tract exist to warrant the exception d buffering along thoroughfares 1 where side and rear lot lines abut

land uses shrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum screening effect guidelines for the arrangement of plant material are illustrated in table 4676 8 in the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of this section but the plant materials are not on the approved list the zoning administrator may waive the requirements for plant materials if a plant material is not on the approved list the zoning administrator may determine whether it is acceptable 9 berms may be used as screening provided such berms are at least six feet in height with a maximum slope of  as measured from the exterior property line a berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped  and b if a berm is constructed shrubs are required but the number may be

town in accordance with the trip generation standards set forth in subsection iia1 see the town of weddington tia process and procedures manual for additional information 2 the determination of the number of trips generated also shall take into account passby trips internal trip capture for mx projects eg roadway andor pedestrian connectivity and any proposed transportation demand management system where adequate guarantees are provided by the applicant to the town which ensure the proposed demand management system will function as proposed for the life of the project 3 for redevelopment projects including changes of use trip generation thresholds shall be defined as the number of net new trips anticipated to be generated by the proposed development over and above the number of trips generated by the current use of the site 4 no tia shall be required for special events which either are temporary in nature consistent with the town zoning or which generate trips that meet or exceed the thresholds set forth in subsection 1 but which do not occur during the peak hours of the roadways adjacent to the proposed development 5 nothing herein shall prohibit the town from requiring

developments may not be phased or subdivided in piecemeal fashion to avoid application of this appendix two or more developments represented as separate developments shall be aggregated and treated as a single development where the administrator determines the developments to be part of a unified plan of development and physically proximate to one another based on the following factors 1 there is common ownership indicated by the fact that a the same person company partnership or legal entity controls the developments  b the same person company partnership or legal entity has ownership or a significant legal or equitable interest in the developments  c there is common management of the developments which controls the form of physical development or disposition of parcels of the development  d there is proximity in time between the completion of 80 percent or less of one development and the submission of a development proposal for a subsequent development indicating a common development effort  e the sharing of infrastructure or improvements between multiple developments  f there is a common advertising scheme or promotional effort or plan for the developments  or g any other credible information gained by the town suggesting that the project is being phased or subdivided to avoid the requirements of this appendix c tia submission and completion requirement once the town has made a determination of need for a tia the applicant may proceed with the tia study in accordance with the terms of the most recent version of the town of weddington tia process and

compliance 1 the applicant must determine the existing base level of service los for all intersections within the impact area as described in the applicant shall be required to identify mitigation improvements to the roadway network if at least one of the following conditions exists when comparing base level of services to project conditions 1 the total average delay at an intersection or individual approach delay increases by 25% or greater while maintaining the same los  2 the los degrades by at least one level  3 or los is an f this determination shall be based on the most currently accepted highway capacity manual hcm methodology for turning lanes mitigation improvements shall be identified when the simtraffic analysis indicates that the max queue exceeds the storage capacity of the existing lane the proposed mitigation measures required to meet the los standards may be modified subject to final approval of the town council to substantially achieve the standards purpose and intent of this ordinance the determination of substantial achievement based upon an expert opinion provided by the towns designated transportation engineer 2 as an alternative to mitigation the developer may elect to phase the project reduce its intensity or delay the project until the los standards have been met as a result of a transportation improvement planned by the town the north carolina department of transportation ncdot or another party b mitigation mitigation measures shall be consistent with the design standards found within the town of weddington roadway standards mitigation may include participation by the town or other governmental agencies or private parties and also may include the funding of road improvements planned by other governmental agencies such
