floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of susanville b within an adopted regulatory floodway the city of susanville shall prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge c if subsections a and b of this section are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   2013 variance procedures  nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of susanville to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2013  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of susanville need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of susanville believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the lassen county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  2013  appeal board a the city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter the application forms and fees shall be the same as required for zoning variances b in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances d variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance e upon consideration of the factors of subsection a of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  2013  maintenance of flood protection measures the maintenance of any and all flood protection measures levees dikes dams or reservoirs is required of the jurisdiction agency or other entity to whom such measures provide protection if these measures are privately owned an operation or maintenance plan is required of the owner the city shall acknowledge all maintenance plans by the adoption of such plans by ordinance  2013

real property for adult entertainment businesses variously described as adult bookstores adult motion picture facilities figure model studios adult cabarets adult motels and massage parlors have serious objectionable operational characteristics which if such uses were allowed to become concentrated in certain areas of the city may have adverse and deleterious effects upon the character of such areas and adjacent neighborhoods and may contribute to blight and skidrow atmospheres b permitting the concentration of adult entertainment businesses may tend to create and foster a blighted andor downgraded atmosphere in surrounding neighborhoods and areas within the city leading to reduction of property values c permitting adult entertainment businesses in residential zones or in zones adjacent to schools regular school bus stops churches or public recreational areas or within close proximity to such uses may expose minors to such facilities and this may adversely affect such minors due to their immaturity d special locational regulation of adult entertainment business uses is necessary to insure that such uses do not become incompatible land uses and further will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of zones in which they are permitted thereby adversely affecting property values and deterring or interfering with the development and operation of other businesses within the city e there is a higher incidence of crime especially crimes against the person in areas in which adult entertainment businesses are permitted to cluster or become concentrated and that such crimes and the incidence thereof increase in the late evening and night hours requiring increased effort on the part of public and safety personnel to police such activities with resultant costs to the city f the city has reviewed studies from the cities of austin texas  indianapolis indiana  los angeles california  phoenix arizona  and saint paul minnesota which document the secondary impacts of adult entertainment businesses and determined that the findings of these studies support the concerns of the city of susanville  2006 amended during 1200 supplementation  zoning ordinance
