including its land use patterns and natural resources the pud district is intended to achieve the following land use objectives 1 provide a variety of housing and lot sizes to promote the planning of a development that is more sensitive to the protection of natural resources on sites by clustering the housing in areas physically suited to accommodating development and preserving the resources in open space 2 minimize the number of residential lots that are less than the stated lot area minimums for the underlying residential zoning district 3 encourage the protection of open space by permitting developments with a range of densities that also provide both active and passive open space consistent with the open space character of the surrounding area 4 preserve open spaces to reduce erosion improve water quality provide wildlife habitats retain scenic views and reduce storm water runoff 5 preserve areas with steep terrain by respecting topography and other natural features in the
