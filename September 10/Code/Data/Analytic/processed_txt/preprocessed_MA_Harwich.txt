residential wind energy systems purpose it is the purpose of this regulation to promote the safe effective and efficient use of residential wind energy systems installed to reduce the onsite consumption of utilitysupplied electricity a findings harwich finds that wind energy is an abundant renewable and nonpolluting energy resource and that its conversion to electricity will reduce our dependence on nonrenewable energy resources and decrease the air and water pollution that results from the use of conventional energy sources distributed small wind energy systems will also enhance the reliability and power quality of the power grid reduce peak power demands and help diversify the states energy supply portfolio small wind systems also make the residential electricity supply market more competitive by promoting customer choice 1 the commonwealth of massachusetts has enacted a number of laws and programs to encourage the use of smallscale renewable residential energy systems including rebates net metering property and sales tax exemptions and solar easements however many existing zoning ordinances contain restrictions which while not intended to discourage the installation of small wind turbines can substantially increase the time and costs required to obtain necessary construction permits 2 therefore it is necessary to standardize and streamline the issuance of permits for small residential wind energy systems so that this clean renewable energy resource can be utilized in a costeffective and timely manner 3 b definitions as used in this section the following terms shall have the meanings indicated residential wind energy system  a wind energy conversion system consisting of a wind turbine a tower and associated control or conversion electronics which has a rated capacity of not more than 25 kw and which is intended to reduce onsite consumption of residential utility power for a single residential lot rotor  the blades and hub of
