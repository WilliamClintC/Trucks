statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of gulfport florida does ordain as set forth in this chapter  5587 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas in the city of gulfport are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life property damage health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which could adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages  5587 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  5587 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  5 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  5587 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be

years of development the area that this section is intended to cover will be referred to as the conservation overlay district development of this area started in the early 1900s and continues to be a popular residential area the original predominant housing types were singlestory bungalow and cottage styles many of which were built as vacation homes these homes were small and have been built onto throughout the years currently there are a number of housing types that have created an eclectic mix of styles that have been remodeled and added to by a diversity of property owners throughout the years the eclectic nature of the conservation overlay district created by a diversity of housing styles built at a human scale is the very thing that residents are concerned about protecting new development pressures and flood plain regulations have created a pattern of development that is inconsistent with the character of these neighborhoods while this area of the city has attracted new residents because of the character their desire to build larger homes devoid of any architectural features or landscaping next to smaller single story homes is actually leading to the demise of the very thing that attracts new residents to the conservation overlay district the desire to build homes with modern interior layouts has led to the use of readily available tract home construction plans when built next to each other using the same architectural style same general footprint and with little to no landscaping these designs give the appearance of a new subdivision as opposed to complementing the scale diversity and maturity of the surrounding neighborhood twostory development can create an even greater sense of incompatibility if the design does not include attention to massing or scale this becomes problematic particularly with redevelopment of existing structures on smaller lots many times the only cost effective way to build an addition is to build up flood regulations require elevating structures which in turn creates a home that is often out of scale with surrounding homes the citizenry of the area have voiced their concerns about incompatibility issues with new residential development based upon this urging the city council instructed staff to develop a set of architectural standards that would still encourage redevelopment of the conservation overlay district while protecting the character of this unique part of the city that character being defined in part by homes built on a human scale has created the small town atmosphere found in this area human scale is the relationship or proportion between the human form and a structure gulfport is in fact a small town and the preservation of that character in the older part of the city is of paramount importance not only to the homeowners within the conservation overlay district but to the city as a whole these guidelines are not intended to limit creativity rather they are established to act as a tool for sitespecific design of new and redeveloped structures that recognize and enhance the character of the surrounding neighborhood the shape of a house its arrangement of doors and windows its roof style its architectural style all make up the character of a house and contribute to the collective appearance of the neighborhood b applicability the cod conservation overlay zoning district regulations shall apply to all property within the district in addition to any other zoning district regulations applicable to said property these regulations shall apply to all new singlefamily and multifamily development and redevelopment or remodeling of existing singlefamily and multifamily development within the district as set forth herein c definitions the following definitions shall apply to these zoning district regulations architectural features features that enhance the residential or humanpedestrian scale examples of such architectural features are bay windows dormers open porches and entryways arbors and trellises garden walls and window and door awnings  articulation the giving of emphasis to architectural elements like windows balconies entries etc that create a complementary pattern or rhythm dividing large buildings into smaller identifiable pieces articulation also includes the use of projections and recesses that divide large facades into humanscaled proportions that reflect singlefamily dwellings nearby and avoid repetitive monotonous undifferentiated wall planes  block front the street front area on both sides of the street extending a full block in either direction from the end of the block the subject property is located on  canopy tree any species of tree that when mature provides a shade canopy including oak trees and pine trees such species shall be approved trees as identified in article xx of this chapter  differentiation showing a difference in appearance see also articulation  dormer a projection from a sloping roof that contains a window  facade the front of the building facing or oriented toward the street or roadway excluding alleyways  human scale the proportional relationship of a particular building structure or streetscape element to the human form and function human scale relates the size andor height of a structure to the height and mass of a pedestrian traveling along the sidewalk or street adjacent to that structure  human scale these diagrams help illustrate the concept of human or pedestrian scale the diagram to the left shows no human scale in relation to the building the diagram to the right shows human scale features such as columns awnings and entryways that bring the same building into relationship with pedestrians primary entrance the primary or principle pedestrian entrance of all buildings except outbuildings the primary entrance is the entrance designed for access by pedestrians from the sidewalk or street if a sidewalk is not present this is the principle architectural entrance even though daytoday residential access may be via a secondary entrance associated with a garage driveway or other vehicular use area  primary street front the street or roadway to which the home is oriented  scale the apparent relationship between two entities such as the relationship of a buildings height to human height the relationship between different buildings heights or the relationship between the size of an addition and the building to which it is attached  secondary street front on a lot with multiple street fronts the secondary street front is the street or roadway to which the home is not oriented  street tree a tree or group of trees that line the edge of a street or roadway this would include trees in the rightofway  understory vegetation low to the ground vegetation such as shrubs and similar plants this definition does not include sod which is considered ground cover d standards the following standards shall be applied to the design and construction of structures within the cod conservation overlay zoning district 1 existing single and multifamily structures it is the existing singlefamily structures that for the most part have created the uniqueness and character of this area for this reason care should be taken to maintain that character when remodeling and redeveloping these homes the application of these standards ensures that an upgrade to an existing structure does not detract from the overall appearance and scale of the surrounding neighborhood while still allowing for redevelopment of the older housing stock and reinvestment into these neighborhoods all existing single and multifamily structures in the district shall be constructed in accordance with the following regulations a the remodeling of facades on existing structures shall at a minimum match the design elements of the existing facade these elements include but are not limited to window size and spacing roof pitch and overhang of eaves of the existing structure for example in enclosing an existing garage for extra living space the facade of the new enclosure would have to provide a number of openings in the form of doors andor windows of a size and spacing consistent with those of the existing facade if however the garage enclosure is part of an entirely new facade the new facade elements shall be as set forth in subsection 2 of this section when an existing single or multifamily structure erects a second story or a new garage the elements for new single and multifamily structures shall be as set forth in subsection 2 of this section as it concerns multistory structures and garages 2 new single and multifamily structures all newly constructed single and multifamily structures in the district shall be constructed in accordance with the following regulations a facade the facade of a building is the front of the building facing or oriented toward the street or roadway excluding alleyways the primary street front in the case of lots with multiple fronts is the street front that the pedestrian entryway is oriented and that which the majority of houses are oriented towards the secondary street front is the front that is not designed for primary pedestrian access from the street or sidewalk garages may sometimes be located on either primary or secondary street fronts however the garage is not considered as a pedestrian entryway facades new houses without front porches do not contribute to the richness and warmth of the block all facades shall be constructed as follows 1 finish all facades shall have a finish treatment such as siding stucco or similar aesthetic wall treatment simply painting an unfinished exterior like concrete block is not sufficient to meet this standard the base material shall have an aesthetic finish 2 minimum features a facade whether primary or secondary shall exhibit at least two 2 of following features a articulation  b awnings or shutters  or c porches andor entryway features 3 windows the facade shall have at least one window every twenty 20 feet per floor the size of any facade window including the frame shall be a minimum of nine 9 square feet b primary entrance orientation the primary entrance is the entrance designed for access by pedestrians from the sidewalk or street if a sidewalk is not present this is the principle architectural entrance even though daytoday residential access may be via a secondary entrance associated with a garage driveway or other vehicular use area the entryway is an important feature for maintenance of neighborhood characteristics porches front porches are fundamental characteristics of some architectural styles and always add a sense of presence and welcome the house without an entry feature lacks the architectural interest and sense of welcome of the other houses all primary entrances shall be constructed as follows the principle entrance of all buildings except outbuildings such as sheds or garages shall be oriented directly toward the primary street front c garages the location size position and appearance of a garage can have a great effect on the appearance of a home and should be designed with care garages were not prominent features of the earlier housing stock found within the conservation overlay district and should not dominate new housing or redevelopment of existing housing garage this illustrates the use of a recessed garage with a prominent entrywayporch feature garages shall be constructed as follows the garage shall not be the prominent feature of the front facade a garage shall be staggered from adjacent garages and shall not be placed beside an existing garage on an adjacent property unless both adjoining and adjacent properties have garages located directly adjacent to the subject property at least 2 of the following features shall be used in designing new garages unless the garage is placed facing the secondary street front on corner lots or the garage is placed toward the rear of the property facing an alleyway 1 articulation of the facade to set the garage back from the rest of the facade  2 use of a side load garage with window openings as per the facade requirements  3 no more than onehalf 12 of the facade shall be used for a garage  and 4 a prominent entryway with open porch shall be used that spans onehalf 12 of the facade garage width garage no more than half the width of the house d landscaping landscaping has a dramatic affect on the appearance of a home and in making new homes appear more mature and in keeping with the existing neighborhood character the maintenance of existing tree canopies and street trees creates continuity between established neighborhood development and new infill development understory low to the ground and foundation plantings mitigate the severity of new construction by melding nature with urbanization a newly completed home without landscaping often leads to the feeling that it does not fit in with the surrounding neighborhood a well thought out landscape plan can make that same home look like it was built years ago the following landscaping shall be required 1 general a minimum landscaped area of twenty 20 square feet of landscaping per one thousand 1000 square feet of lot area shall be required this is inclusive of any green space or permeable surface regulations set forth in the applicable zoning district 2 street trees when street trees are present on the block at least one tree per 50 linear feet shall be planted along the street front which may be in the rightofway the minimum requirement for street trees shall be four 4 inches in diameter as measured at breast height with a minimum height of eight 8 feet the species shall be of the same type as other street trees found along the block face if there is a mature existing street tree canopy on the property meeting the foregoing requirements no additional street trees shall be required alternative species may be used if overhead utility lines make replication of the existing tree canopy impractical and the spacing requirement shall be adjusted to meet the intent of providing a canopy cover when said trees mature 3 canopy trees there shall be a minimum of two 2 canopy trees per site at least one 1 of these trees shall be placed within the front yard existing canopy trees and required street trees as long as they are canopy trees may be applied toward this minimum the minimum size shall be four 4 inches in diameter as measured at breast height with a minimum height of eight 8 feet adjustments to the required location of canopy trees may be made to accommodate an existing tree canopy 4 existing trees encroachments of new structures into the required side and rear yard setbacks to accommodate existing mature canopy trees are allowed without a variance provided such encroachments do not project by more than twentyfive 25 percent of the required setback 5 foundation plantings all facades shall include foundation plantings along the periphery of the facade excluding driveway areas there shall be a minimum planting area of three 3 feet in width landscaped with understory vegetative materials foundation plantings may be counted toward the landscape requirements set forth elsewhere in this section e multistory structures singlestory houses dominate the singlefamily homes found within the conservation district with the trend toward larger homes multistory development and redevelopment is becoming popular in an effort to maximize the useable area of small lots floodplain regulations require elevation of structures above a defined flood elevation many people elect to build above the required flood elevation to take advantage of the large space left under the structure for garage and storage areas this type of larger scale development can dwarf adjacent single story development and disturb the character of an area simply due to the scale and bulk of the new or remodeled home attention to massing and scale can help to offset these disturbances and even be used to create the uniqueness that has lead to the creation of the neighborhood character scale house no 3 appears out of scale because its form is too simple revised scale the revised design of house no 3 became compatible with its neighbors by stepping back the second story and providing variation in the roof and building forms the following regulations apply to structures having more than one 1 story whether each story is for living or habitable area or not 1 facade variations repetitive monotonous undifferentiated wall planes shall not be permitted buildings shall be articulated with projections recesses covered entryways porches balconies covered box or bay windows andor similar features dividing large facades into human scaled proportions good example of providing human scale and compatibility with adjacent home use of dormers and maintaining a single roof eave line poor example  while this example does exhibit some standards the entryway is out of scale and there are too many roof pitches 2 second story differentiation the second living or habitable story shall be differentiated from the ground floor or first living floor in a home required to be elevated to meet fema related regulations by utilizing the following features a setbacks the second living or habitable story shall be set back from the side and front building lines of the ground floor or first living floor in a home required to be elevated to meet fema related regulations by no less than two 2 feet and shall be centered over the ground floor when not prohibited by required engineering practices andor fema related regulations the foregoing setback shall not be required where the eave line of the roof at the facade or facades in the case of a lot with multiple fronts is brought down to the ground floor eave line see illustration below dormers shall not make up more than twothirds  23  of the second floor facade width the only projections allowed into the second story setback area are roof overhangs of no more than 18 inches no cantilevering of a

trips generated by the proposed development meets or exceeds five 5 percent of the facilitys peak hour capacity 3 should the impacted facility be operating at an los that meets the locally adopted los standard it would not be eligible for the application of proportionate fair share provisions 4 should the impacted facility be operating at a substandard los based on existing conditions or as a result of the impacts of a proposed development the facility would be identified as eligible for proportionate fair share provisions and the applicant would be notified as such 5 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include without limitation separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 6 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless
