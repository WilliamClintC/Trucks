general principles underlying this code of ethics athe stability and proper operation of democratic representative government depend upon public confidence in the integrity of the government and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon their elected officials bgovernmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented channels and processes of the governmental structure cboard members must be able to act in a manner that maintains their integrity and independence yet is responsive to the interests and needs of those they represent dboard members must always remain aware that at various times they play different roles 1as advocates who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens  2as legislators who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting ordinances resolutions and orders  3as decisionmakers who arrive at fair and impartial quasijudicial and administrative determinations eboard members must know how to distinguish among these roles to determine when each role is appropriate and to act accordingly fboard members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents each official must find within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate passed 7202010  3042 ethical conduct aboard members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the board board members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do bat the same time board members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow board members or citizens to declare that a board member is behaving unethically because one disagrees with that board member on a question of policy and not because of that board members behavior is unfair dishonest and irresponsible and is itself unethical passed 7202010  3043 acting with integrity board members should act with integrity and independence from improper influence as they exercise the duties of their offices characteristics and behaviors consistent with this standard include the following aadhering firmly to a code of sound values bbehaving consistently and with respect toward everyone with whom they interact cexhibiting trustworthiness dliving as if they are on duty as elected officials regardless of where they are or what they are doing eusing their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it presenting their opinions to all in a reasonable forthright consistent manner fremaining incorruptible selfgoverning and unaffected by improper influence while at the same time being able to consider the options and ideas of others gdisclosing contacts and information about issues that they receive outside of public meetings and refraining from seeking or receiving information about quasijudicial matters outside of the quasijudicial proceedings themselves htreating other board members and the public with respect and honoring the opinions of others even when the board members disagree with those opinions inot reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard jshowing respect for their offices and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on those offices krecognizing that they are part of a group and acting accordingly lrecognizing that individual board members are not generally allowed to act on behalf of the board but may do so only if the board specifically authorizes it and that the board must nonetheless take official action as a body passed 7202010  3044 impropriety aboard members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties their official actions should be above reproach although opinions may vary about what behavior is inappropriate this board will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable person who is aware of all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the board members action would conclude that the action was inappropriate bif a board member believes that his or her actions while legal and ethical may be misunderstood that member should seek the advice of the town attorney and should consider publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it passed 7202010  3045 setting a good example aboard members should faithfully perform the duties of their offices they should act as especially responsible citizens whom others can trust and respect they should set a good example for others in the community keeping in mind that trust and respect must continually be earned bboard members should faithfully prepare for and attend meetings they should carefully analyze all credible information properly submitted to them mindful of the need not to engage in communications outside the meeting in quasijudicial matters they should demand full accountability from those over whom the board has authority cboard members should be willing to bear their fair share of the boards workload to the extent appropriate they should be willing to put the boards interests ahead of their own passed 7202010  3046 openness in board affairs aboard members should conduct the affairs of the board in an open and public manner they should comply with all applicable laws governing open meetings and public records recognizing that doing so is an important way to be worthy of the publics trust they should remember when they meet that they are conducting the publics business bthey should also remember that local government records belong to the public and not to board members or their employees cin order to ensure strict compliance with the laws concerning openness board members should make clear that an environment of transparency and candor is to be maintained at all times in the town government they should prohibit unjustified delay in fulfilling public records requests  they should take deliberate steps to make certain that any closed sessions held by the board are lawfully conducted and that any such sessions do not stray from the purposes
