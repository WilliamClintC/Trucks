2862928649  reserved stormwater management findings of fact the city council the governing body of the city makes the following findings 1 the management of stormwater runoff is necessary to reduce pollutants siltation sedimentation flooding inflow and infiltration into the city storm drainage system and receiving waters all of which adversely impact land and water resources and the health safety property and welfare of the citizens of the city 2 the city maintains or must ensure maintenance of a system of stormwater management facilities including but not limited to inlets conduits manholes channels ditches swashes drainage easements retention and detention basins infiltration facilities and other components as well as natural waterways 3 it has been determined a stormwater system survey and condition assessment that much of the citys storm sewer infrastructure is in need of more regular maintenance rehabilitation upgrading or expansion in order to prevent flooding and water quality impacts from storm events 4 there is a lack of resources equipment manpower funds in the city to adequately address the stormwater system improvements and maintenance necessary to reduce future flooding and water quality impacts 5 the city needs to enhance the ability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures 6 every built upon parcel of real property in the city either uses or benefits from the stormwater management system and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly benefit the owners of all real property 7 in the city the extent of use of the stormwater management system by each classification of real property is dependent on a variety of factors that influence runoff such as land use topography intensity of development amount of impervious surface and location in a particular watershed or basin 8 in the city property owners and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system and benefit from the system charges therefore should bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the service and every effort should be made to fairly and reasonably spread the cost of the system to all property owners and users 9 it is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and most specifically the owners of real property that a stormwater management utility with interim fees and classifications be established by ordinance and implemented as part of the citys utility enterprise system as authorized by sc sections 481410 to 4814150 supp 1991  section 5730 supp 1991  and other relevant laws and regulations of the state 10 creating a permanent stormwater management utility rate structure and schedule of fees is a difficult time consuming and costly endeavor and the city is committed to such an undertaking but finds it is necessary to provide for interim stormwater management utility fees and classifications until the completion of a citywide impervious surface study thus council finds that a stormwater management utility with interim fees and classifications should be established with the intent of establishing permanent stormwater management utility fees and classifications based on the results of further study to include determination of impervious surface areas throughout the city the city council further finds that the interim fees and classifications established hereby are reasonable and equitable given the use of and benefits accruing to properties within each of the various classifications 11 the interim stormwater utility fee will not be imposed on agricultural lands forestlands or undeveloped lands pursuant to the amendment of sc a75 r70 s453  9122017 authority this article may be cited as the stormwater management utility is adopted pursuant to sc sections 481410 et seq sc sc et seq  9122017 definitions unless the context specifically indicates otherwise the meanings of words and terms used in this article shall be set forth in sc sc supp 1992  9122017 establishment of a stormwater management utility  administration  duties and powers city council hereby establishes a stormwater management utility utility to carry out the purposes functions and responsibilities herein set forth the governing body of the utility shall be city council the city administrator shall administer the utility and billing will be accomplished billing and administration of the citys water and sewer system the utility shall have the duties and powers set forth below which powers are not necessarily exclusive to the utility to wit 1 regular inspections of public and private stormwater management facilities and measures and the construction thereof 2 maintenance and improvement of stormwater management facilities that have been accepted by the city for that purpose 3 retrofitting existing stormwater management facilities to reduce existing flooding problems or to improve water quality 4 acquisition of interests in land including easements 5 design and construction of stormwater management facilities and measures and acquisition of equipment 6 billing and collecting stormwater management utility fees pursuant to the fee schedule set forth in this as it may be amended from time to time 7 any and all duties and powers delegated or granted to it as a local government implementing agency under the laws and state regulations and the ordinances of the city  9122017 boundaries and jurisdiction the boundaries and jurisdiction of the utility shall encompass all those portions of the incorporated city as they may exist from time to time and such additional areas lying inside the corporate limits of those jurisdictions within the city as shall be approved by the city council  9122017 stormwater management utility fees city council shall establish amounts and classifications for stormwater management utility fees to be implemented to help fund the utility and its programs and projects city council shall consider among other things the following criteria in establishing fees 1 the fee system must be reasonable and equitable so that property owners and users pay to the extent they contribute to the needs for and benefit from the utility city council recognizes that these benefits while substantial in many cases cannot be measured directly  2 stormwater maintenance costs constructioninfrastructure improvement costs and the overall operational costs of the stormwater system should be borne equally by all classifications of property owners in the city in that all will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits of an improved and wellmaintained system  3 the components of the calculations used to establish fees shall be based on whatever is determined to be reasonable and fair to be approved by city council and may include but shall not be limited to the cost factors of administration duties and powers found in section 28653  and 4 the practical difficulties and limitations related to establishing calculating and administering such fees  9122017 stormwater management utility rates creating a permanent utility rate structure and schedule of fees is a difficult time consuming and costly endeavor and the city is committed to such an undertaking but finds it is necessary to provide for interim stormwater management utility fees and classifications collectively interim fees until the completion of a citywide impervious surface study thus council finds that the utility with interim fees should be established with the intent of establishing permanent stormwater management utility fees and classifications collectively permanent fees and together with the interim fees the fees based on the results of further study to include determination of impervious surface areas throughout the city city council shall establish the permanent fees following the completion of the stormwater management utility rate study and shall amend the interim fees citys annual budget ordinance or otherwise thereafter the permanent fees will be reviewed and may be amended as necessary by city council annual budget ordinance or otherwise as needed the interim fees shall be as follows a for all parcels containing a singlefamily residence a monthly fee of $400 per parcel shall be assigned for parcels containing multiple residences on the parcel a monthly fee of $400 per unit shall be assigned b for all parcels containing multifamily residences apartments duplexes condominiums

maintained onsite d for all developed parcels containing nonresidential land use commercial or industrial a monthly fee of $4400 per parcel shall be assigned e for all developed taxexempt and nonprofit properties a monthly fee of $1400 per parcel shall be assigned  9122017 investment and reinvestment of funds and borrowing funds generated for the utility from fees bond issues other borrowing and other sources shall be utilized only for those purposes for which the utility has been established including but not limited to the following purposes planning  acquisition of interests in land including easements  design and construction of facilities  maintenance of stormwater system  billing and administration  and water quality and water quantity management including surveillance private maintenance inspection construction inspection and other activities which are reasonably required such funds shall be invested and reinvested pursuant to the same procedures and practices established by the city for investment and reinvestment of funds city council may use any form of borrowing authorized by the laws of the state to fund capital acquisitions or expenditures for the utility  9122017 stormwater management utility fee billing delinquencies and collection a the fees will be part of the citys water bill and may be sent united states mail or by alternative means notifying the property owner of the amount of the bill the date the payment is due and the date when past due the fees may be levied collected and paid in the same manner as user fees applied to water bills the fees may also be billed and collected along with other charges including but not limited to other city assessments fees or property taxes as deemed most effective and efficient failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment nevertheless if a property owner is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land the city may backbill for a period of up to one year b in addition to any other penalties or remedies provided in this article the city upon the recommendation of the city attorney and approval of the city administrator may institute a civil action in the appropriate court to obtain compliance with the provisions of this chapter or remedy or prevent the violation or threatened violation of any provision of this chapter  9122017 city liability nothing

be invalid for any reason then this holding does not affect other provisions or applications of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application and to this end the provisions of this article are severable  9122017 part ii  land use code flood damage prevention article i  in general statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in sc titles 5 and 6 and amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry art 1  a 11112014 findings of fact a the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages art 1  b 11112014 statement of purpose and objectives a it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally this chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands b the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding c floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs art 1  c 11112014 lands to which this chapter applies a this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the federal emergency management agency fema in its flood insurance study dated  with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter b upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the federal emergency management agency fema in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of the county with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter art 1  d 11112014 establishment of development permit a development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities art 1  e 11112014 compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations art 1  f 11112014 interpretation in the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail art 1  g 11112014 partial invalidity and severability if any part of this chapter is declared invalid the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force art 1  h 11112014 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder art 1  i 11112014 penalties for violation violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more that $50000 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days or both each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation art 1  j 11112014 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have
