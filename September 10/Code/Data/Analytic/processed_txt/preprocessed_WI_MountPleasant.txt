suppression  c the village board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity in light of wis stats  3 and does not intend by adopting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived to regulate obscenity and since nudity in and of itself is not obscene it declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns  d bars and taverns featuring live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity  disrupt the peace and order of the communities  depreciate the value of real property  harm the economic welfare of the  613 general provisions  613  communities and negatively affect the quality of life of the communities  and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of citizens  e the village board recognizes the us supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment and the village board further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights  f however the village board is aware based on the experiences of other communities that bars and taverns in which live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the village board believes are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village  g among such secondary effects are the 1 potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses  2 potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist  3 health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and 4 potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct h the village board desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the village  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight  and i the village board has determined that enactment of an ordinance prohibiting live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages promotes the goal of minimizing preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity 2

minimize the risk of reoffense for those sex offenders who will recommit sex offenses against children there is a compelling need to separate sex offenders from places where children congregate or play in public places 2 intent this a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the village from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close

and comprehensive plan or component neighborhood plan if any of the village or county in areas for which detailed neighborhood plans have not been completed the street layout shall conform to the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relationship to existing and proposed streets to the topography to such natural features as streams and tree growth to further the public convenience and safety to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets to existing or planned utilities and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas the subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street or approved way  74182 arterial street arrangement 152 a arterial streets shall be platted with greater rightofway widths and built with flatter vertical curvature to accommodate their planned heavier traffic volumes including possible transit service  be properly integrated and continuous with the existing and proposed system of arterials  and often will be restricted as to the location and amount of direct access to be provided to adjacent lands in order to protect the trafficcarrying capacity and safety of arterials and to provide some shielding of adjacent residential uses from the adverse impacts of arterial traffic whenever the proposed land division contains or is adjacent to an arterial highway or major collector street design of the street and lot layout shall take the following into account 1 in the case of nonresidential land uses the proliferation of many high volume access points shall be discouraged in favor of fewer planned openings that are shared or that provide service internal street system 2 in the case of residential land uses with high vehicle density the minimum access for nonresidential uses shall be observed or use made of the reversed frontage access approach both with consideration for screening of the uses from arterial traffic impact 3 in the case of residential uses with lower vehicle densities direct access to the arterials shall be limited to the lowest density residences with encouragement of deeper lots and greater setbacks and all other residential uses shall be arranged on internal streets or ways including reversed frontage shielded toward the arterial by a screening area consisting of earth mounds or plantings the width of side lots and the depth of reversed lots  74181 general provisions  74182   74183 collector street arrangement 153 collector streets may be platted with a width somewhat greater than the local streets they serve and a somewhat flatter gradient in order to convey the traffic from residential areas to the arterial street and highway system and to accommodate possible transit routes or bicyclepedestrian paths collector streets may also contain along their routes neighborhood or subcommunity retail school or other institutional facilities although access is usually not restricted between a collector street and any abutting parcels when the amount of traffic volume is expected to be sufficiently high residential uses desirably should take their primary access from the feeder local streets rather than from the collector streets collector streets should also be positioned with respect to topography to permit an efficient design for storm and sanitary sewers  74184 local street arrangement 154 with such screening shall be adequate to accommodate a screening area no less than 20 feet in width a local streets are primarily for the purpose of providing access to property and should therefore be designed to avoid as much as possible any or any fast movement of vehicles the emphasis should instead be on the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists fitting the local street and lot pattern to topography to achieve good building sites and to permit efficient water storm and sanitary utility service achieving such criteria will involve emphasis on shorter streets and avoiding excessive widths or straightness both of which can contribute to high speeds and accidents three subcategories of local streets are as follows 1 subcollector a subdivision street having limited usually only the amount originating or destined within that subdivision in order to both keep the limited at slower speeds and to provide an aesthetically pleasing and functional placement for building sites the rightsofway should be gently curving avoiding straightness rightsofway and paving width for subcollectors shall be sufficient to accommodate their subsidiary role of handling limited   however the width shall still be less than for collector streets in recognition of the dominant purpose of access to parcels and the need for pedestrian and bicycle safety 2 lane serving somewhat less traffic than the subcollector being either a longer culdesac or loop street or providing access to a series of short places branching off the lane rightsofway and pavement widths should be kept limited consistent with providing space for underground utility needs and expected onstreet parking or snow storage rather than traffic volume  74182 mount pleasant code  74184   74185 adjacent properties 155 proposed streets intended to serve or extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided shall normally be extended as part of

be quite low both because of the limited number of traffic generating parcels on the street and the total absence of the rightsofway and paving widths can be the least of any of the local streets with such requirements set more by the expected amount of onstreet parking and snow storage space or the need for underground utilities or vehicle turnaround space rather than traffic volume a whenever a proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad rightofway or limited access highway a highway where rightofaccess has been purchased by a unit of government or restricted as provided by

pleasant approved or adopted storm water management plans for specific areas or watersheds b findings of fact the village board of trustees finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater  74232 mount pleasant code  74233  recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage

regulation of the district in which they are located a background and purpose recent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of telecommunication services these new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or conforming existing towers this requires that the village regulate these wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances 1 a number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the village and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers 2 the intent of this proposed regulation is to provide for the establishment and or expansion of wireless telecommunication services within the village while protecting neighborhoods and airport safety zones and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunications facilities design siting and screening more specifically this regulation has been developed in order to a maximize use of existing and approved conforming towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the community  b encourage providers to colocate their facilities on a single tower  c minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas  d encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities  e encourage the use of monopole towers as more ecofriendly and more  f protect residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication towers   864 general provisions  865  g avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower
