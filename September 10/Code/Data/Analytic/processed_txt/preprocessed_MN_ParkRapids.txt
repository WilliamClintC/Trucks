gathering supplied the alcohol the park rapids city council finds that aevents and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of twentyone are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement  bprohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons as well as the general public from injuries related to alcohol consumption such as alcohol overdose or alcoholrelated traffic collisions  calcohol is an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user doften events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents however there are times when the parents isare present and condone the activity and in some circumstances provide the alcohol  eeven though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime it is difficult to prove and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption  and fa deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
