11  payday and title loan businesses legislative findings these businesses should be regulated by the city because certain payday and title loan lending practices have proven detrimental to the financial security of individuals and families residing in the city payday and title loan lending practices often have an unreasonably adverse effect upon the elderly the economically disadvantaged and other residents of the city frequently taking a payday or title loan puts borrowers in much worse financial shape than before they took the loan therefore the purpose of this ordinance is to require licensing for the purpose of regulating certain payday and title loan lending practices to minimize the detrimental effects of such practices on the citizens of the city by regulating payday and title loan lending practices occurring in the city consistent with the laws of the state of kansas furthermore the city finds there is a need to regulate the placement and location of payday and title loan businesses throughout the city a clustering of these businesses can have a detrimental effect on the neighborhood and create the appearance of a commercial district in decline these businesses do not create much foot traffic for adjacent businesses and a proliferation of them at particular locations can overwhelm a neighborhood and can be a disincentive for the location of other neighborhood businesses in close proximity to them finally the fact that many surrounding communities in the metropolitan area are adopting or considering adopting restrictions on the location of such businesses could result in the city having an undue concentration of these businesses in the city unless location regulations are enacted  definitions the term payday loan business shall refer to any

curbs regardless of system design capacity e stormwater management 1 new development or redevelopment as defined in shall incorporate stormwater management measures to control runoff from the site the allowable runoff is defined by the volume timing and peak rate of runoff and is dependent on the watershed characteristics allowable runoff may be limited by the need to minimize flood damage prevent erosion andor minimize impacts to the ecology and water quality of the downstream drainage system 2 stormwater management for site development may include structural facilities andor nonstructural solutions the developer shall evaluate the site development plan according to the flowchart in figure 56011 this chart provides decision criteria for determining the potential impacts of the site on

answer to the question in the dialog box and continue to next box to the right or below according to the answer where runoff controls are required lowimpact development practices or offsite control of runoff in addition to or instead of the standard wet or dry bottom basins may be used see e15 b 3 notwithstanding the foregoing it is the opinion of the city that any development will degrade water quality cause stream erosion and contribute to adverse ecological impacts therefore at the discretion of the public works director controls shall be implemented for the 10% and 100% storms 4 flood problems are defined as one or more of the following conditions  a homes buildings or other structures downstream from a proposed development are flooded in a 1% or more frequent flood  b flood damage

downstream drainage system to the point the developments land mass is less than 10% of the total watershed unless waived by the city the city may require additional analysis of the downstream drainage system to identify flooding problems especially in sensitive areas or where flooding has occurred downstream 5 if flooding problems will occur as defined above runoff from the development shall be controlled by limiting the stormwater release rates for the 1% 10% and 100% design storms to the predevelopment peak flow rates for the 1% 10% and 100% storms respectively if flooding problems will not occur as defines above detention of the 1% storm will not be allowed 6 additionally the city may require a study to verify downstream predevelopment peak flow rates are not increased at specific downstream locations due to the development some communities may also establish more stringent release rates in sensitive watersheds f overflow systems each conveyance element of the stormwater drainage system whether open enclosed or detention shall include an overflow element when the insystem capacity defined in is exceeded the overflow element shall be designed to route the surcharge downstream types of overflow systems are sitedependent and may include streets channels overland surfaces redundant piping or spillways or combinations thereof the insystem capacity combined with the

section 16402b shall be for the purpose of encouraging and requiring orderly development at a quality level generally equal to or exceeding that commonly found in projects developed under conventional zoning but permitting deviations from the normal and established development techniques the use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage largescale developments efficient development of small tracts innovative and imaginative site planning conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land the following are specific objectives of the planned zoning districts a the conventional zoning districts should generally not be applied to the improvement of land by other than lotbylot development consequently with the exception of residential subdivisions development proposals which are intended to be subdivided into multiple lots should generally be rezoned to one or more planned zoning districts to ensure the compatibility coordination timing and sequencing of development from and after the adoption of these planned zoning provisions property shall not be rezoned to either office building district or retail business district except under unique circumstances and only upon a showing that requiring rezoning to a planned zoning district would result in undue hardship upon the landowner b planned developments are groupings of buildings or building sites that are planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the zoning was approved by the city the sale subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt or protect the portions thereof from complying with the development standards architectural quality sign concepts and other conditions that were committed to at the time of the rezoning the submittal by the developer and the approval by the city of development plans represents a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans in concept intensity of use aesthetic levels and quantities of open space c planned commercial and industrial developments should be designed so as to result in attractive viable and safe centers and clusters as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares control of vehicular access architectural quality landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods and to assure minimum adverse affects on the street system and other services of the community d the developer will be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land not feasible under application of conventional zoning requirements e deviations from the performance and development standards as provided for in section 16449 may be approved if it is deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the extent that an equal or higher quality development is produced planned zoning districts  standards of development a the uses permitted in any planned zoning district shall be those set forth in the section applicable to that planned zoning district provided however were found to be reasonably necessary in the interest of the public health safety and general welfare the city may condition approval of a development plan by specifying that certain uses otherwise permitted in the district shall not be allowed in that particular development b at the time of preliminary development plan approval the applicant may propose or the city may require that a phasing plan be submitted setting forth the timing and sequencing of development among various types of uses or subgroups of uses or buildings in the development c as a general rule the floor area ratio shall be as set forth in the section applicable to a particular planned zoning district provided however that as long as the overall density of the development does not exceed the density otherwise permitted for a parcel of that size taking into consideration standard street patterns and rightofway requirements the density of portions of the development may vary from that otherwise applicable to that planned zoning district in determining whether or not to allow the density of development to be varied the planning commission and governing body shall give consideration to the following 1 the amount location and proposed use of common space  2 the location and physical characteristics of the site of the proposed development  and 3 the location design and type of uses d any common open space resulting from the variance of standards for density of land shall be set aside for the use and benefit of the occupants of the development the amount of common open space shall be determined at the time of preliminary development plan approval as a condition of preliminary plan approval the planning commission or governing body may require that the developer provide for and establish an agency for the ownership and maintenance of any common open space and may require assurance of the financial and administrative ability of any agency further the planning commission or governing body may require that any agency shall not be dissolved or permitted to dispose of any common open space by sale or otherwise except to a new agency assuming all the duties and obligations of the original agency without first offering to dedicate the same to the city or any other government agency failure of the agency to maintain the common open space shall be considered to be a violation of the ordinance from which this chapter derives e at the time of

from a public street rightofway may be reduced to 75 percent of the stated requirement 2 setbacks of buildings from a property line other than a public street rightofway may be reduced to 85 percent of the stated requirement and setbacks of paved areas from a property line other than a public street rightofway may be reduced to zero if existing or proposed development on that adjacent land

 sign regulations purpose the purpose of this article is to create the framework for a comprehensive and balanced system of content and viewpointneutral regulation of signs to facilitate easy and pleasant communication between people while protecting the first amendment rights of resident individuals and businesses of the city and preserving and improving the quality of the citys environment by avoiding visual clutter harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety property values business opportunities and community appearance with these purposes in mind it is the intent of these regulations a to authorize the use of signs that are 1 compatible with their surroundings 2 appropriate to the activity that displays them 3 expressive of the identity of individual activities and the community as a whole and 4 legible under the circumstances in which they are seen  and b to ensure that nonconforming signs are eliminated in the city after a reasonable grace period that allows sign owners to recoup their initial investments in those nonconforming signs findings and intent  interpretation a signs obstruct views distract motorists displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation the purpose of this article is to regulate the size color illumination movement materials location height and conditions of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation thus ensuring the protection of property values the character of the various neighborhoods the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic investment this article allows adequate communication while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design location size and purpose of all signs this article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the first amendment guarantee of free speech this article is based on the following legislative intent and findings 1 a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of the land or building therefore the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure that they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for the intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified above 2 these regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain are not distracting to motorists and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition 3 these regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the city rather they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above 4 these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather they strike an appropriate balance that that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs 5 these regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected maintained or otherwise posted owned or leased by the federal government the state of kansas johnson county or this city the inclusion of government in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation but instead helps illustrate the type of signs that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation 6 many signs are intended to be temporary in nature and so do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and present a potential hazard to persons and property severe weather conditions include but are not limited to thunderstorms with accompanying high winds tornadoes ice accumulation and flooding and are characteristic of local weather conditions 7 the primary purpose of signs unrelated to traffic and placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions this concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers 8 signs inherently are out of keeping with their surroundings  they are intended to attract attention their purpose fails if they meld into the landscape as such they are a visual blight where the visual clutter of signs is at odds with the citys policy to make structures blend into the topography and be compatible with their natural surroundings 9 signs have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of a city and thus risk depreciating property values this potential adverse effect conflicts with the citys policy to enhance the quality of life land use regulations 10 residents are virtually captive audiences of signs displayed by neighbors  signs are an intrusion into residential privacy and interfere with the enjoyment of a residents property because the vista from the residents property may become so marred by the clutter of signs that the resident cannot successfully avoid observing the sign clutter revised  1 4172017 editors note revised  1 adopted  changed the

nonconforming situations and vested rights nonconforming situations  definitions unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context the words and phrases defined in this article shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article a expenditure a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation the term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position b nonconforming dimension a nonconforming situation that occurs when the height size or minimum floor area of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and the other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located c nonconforming lot a lot existing on  and not created for purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the zoning district in which the lot is located d nonconforming project any structure development or undertaking that is incomplete on  and would have been inconsistent with one or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned e nonconforming sign a sign that on  did not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this chapter f nonconforming site improvement a nonconforming situation that occurs when on  an existing site improvement on a lot including but not limited to parking areas storm drainage facilities sidewalks and landscaping no longer conformed to one or more of the regulations of this chapter applicable to the property g nonconforming use a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in any manner made unlawful by the use regulations or development and performance standards applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property h nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives an existing lot structure or improvement or the use of an existing lot structure or improvement no longer conforms to one or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot structure or improvement is located continuation of nonconforming situations and completions of nonconforming projects a unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on  may be continued b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of c the burden shall be on the landowner or developer to establish entitlement to continuation of nonconforming situations completion of nonconforming projects nonconforming a this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it for purposes of this section a substantial structure shall include any structure in excess of 600 square feet in floor area which was constructed for a use which was a principal use permitted in the zoning district at the time of construction a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished only in accordance with b when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum lot area applicable to that zoning district then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size of a particular district is permissible on a nonconforming lot c when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot be complied with then the governing body may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 development of the property is not reasonably possible for the use proposed without deviations  2 the deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety d for purposes of subsection c above development in compliance with the applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with the setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible e subject to the following sentence if on the date the ordinance from which this chapter derives becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his or her successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where the lot is located and within 500 feet of the lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require the combination when that would be out of character with the neighborhood that has previously been developed extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if the activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space or building area devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to subsection 161204d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by the ordinance from which this chapter derives was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate this use however except as otherwise provided in section 161209 a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c except as otherwise provided in section 161209 a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming  provided however that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the land may be expanded to other portions of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on  and where the development and performance standards otherwise applicable to a use were complied with d the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes inkind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur e notwithstanding subsection a above any structure used as a onefamily dwelling and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of the existing nonconformities with respect to these matters as setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in section 161208 repair maintenance and restoration of property where a nonconforming situation exists a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures and property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure to be renovated shall not be permitted b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or restoration would not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value then the damaged structure may be repaired or restored only in accordance with a nonconforming situation permit issued by the building inspector pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for onefamily dwellings which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a building permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided by subsection 161204e c any repairs renovation or restoration of a structure pursuant to this section which would require the issuance of any permit under of the city also require the issuance of a nonconforming situation permit by the building inspector in support of the application for the permit the applicant shall submit information as may be required to satisfy the city engineer that the cost of the proposed repairs renovation or restoration would not exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure d for purposes of this chapter 1 the cost of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish the renovation repair or restoration 2 the cost of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the total cost of all intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this chapter by doing the work incrementally change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may not be made except in accordance with subsections 161206b e however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this title applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this title is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible only if the governing body issues a nonconforming situation permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the governing body finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter that the intended change will not result in a violation of section 161204 and that all of the applicable requirements of this chapter will be complied with that are reasonably possible compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting these requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible further in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created d in making a determination under subsection 161206c whenever 1 there exists a lot with one or more structures on it and 2 a proposed change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for the lot and 3 the parking or loading requirements that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on these lots because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded by the governing body as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation in violation of section 161204 however if the proposed use is approved the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements than can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain offsite parking if parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the land use permit is required and the offsite parking is reasonably available if offsite parking is not reasonably available at the time the nonconforming situation permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the nonconforming situation permit nonconforming site improvements a on lots with nonconforming site improvements no additions to or repairs or renovations of any structure or site improvement may be made without first either bringing the nonconforming site improvements into complete conformity with the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot is located or obtaining a nonconforming situation permit pursuant to this section provided however that this section shall not apply to the following circumstances 1 repairs or restoration of a structure pursuant to subsection 161205b  or 2 minor repairs or renovation of a structure or site improvement b for purposes of this section minor repairs or renovation shall mean repairs or renovation costs which do not exceed ten percent of the fair market value of a structure or site improvement c when an addition to or repairs or renovation of any structure or site improvement is proposed on a lot with a nonconforming site improvements the governing body may approve a nonconforming situation permit allowing the addition or repairs or renovation if it finds that 1 the nonconforming site improvements is the only nonconforming situation pertaining to the property 2 compliance with the site improvement requirements applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located is not reasonably possible and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety d for purposes of subsection c mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance with the site improvement requirements is not reasonably possible abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the governing body issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations the permit may be issued if the governing body finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent the apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by the ordinance from which this chapter derives was vacant or discontinued on  the 180day period for purposes of this section began to run on  completion of nonconforming projectsvested rights a all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before  as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on  may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as those permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired and a vested rights permit is obtained from the public works director if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction b except as provided in subsection 161209a or in 161210 all work on any nonconforming projects shall cease on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a vested rights permit issued in accordance with this section by the governing body the governing body shall approve a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the development regulations as they existed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete its project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the governing body shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unprovoked building land use or sign permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the development regulations that existed before  2 except as otherwise provided in subdivision b1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before  may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the development regulations that existed before  an expenditure is made at the time a person incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made these expenditures 5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the developer 6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development regulations affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to that person 7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development regulations affecting a development site the governing body may still find that the person acted in good faith if the person did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance for example the governing body may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection 161209b in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subsection 161209b6 the governing body shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed and 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in a manner or location or to a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if the approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations d the governing body shall not consider any application for a vested rights permit authorized by subsection 161209b that is submitted more than 60 days after  the governing body may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives completion of singlefamily residential developments nothing in this chapter shall prevent the developer of a singlefamily residential development from developing in accordance with the terms of a final plat duly recorded in the office of the register of deeds of johnson county provided however if construction is not commenced on any land within five years of the recording of the plat the development rights shall expire provided further that if construction has commenced on any project but is thereafter abandoned for a period in excess of five years the project may only be completed in accordance with the provisions of section 161209 nonconforming signs a subject to the remaining restrictions of this section and the provisions of section 161208 nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives may be continued b no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign without limiting the generality of the foregoing no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign c a nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced and the message may not be changed except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this chapter except for sign maintenance as defined in section 4903 of the city d subject to the other provisions of this section nonconforming signs may be maintained and repaired so long as the cost of the work within any 12month period does not exceed 50 percent of the value tax value if listed for tax purposes of the sign no work shall be done without the person proposing to do the work first submitting information as may be required to satisfy the city engineer that the cost of the work would not exceed 50 percent of the value of the sign e if a nonconforming sign other than an outdoor advertising sign advertises a business service commodity accommodation attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days after abandonment by the sign owner owner of the property where the sign is located or other person having control over the sign f if a nonconforming outdoor advertising sign remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall within 30 days after abandonment be altered to comply with this article or be removed by the sign owner owner of the property where the sign is located or other person having control over the sign for purposes of this section a sign is blank if 1 it advertises a business service commodity accommodation attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted  or 2 the advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part  or 3 the advertising copy paid for by a person other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed article 13  floodplain

health safety and general welfare findings of facts a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in subsection a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal
