homes in burlingame are either built on flat lots or on hillsides the flat lots are typically of relatively small size with substantial lot coverage hillside developments are visible from a wide area placement of satellite antennas can interfere with views of streetscape natural vegetation and scenery in both flat and hillside areas therefore in order to maintain the aesthetic objective of minimal intrusion into views of neighborhood streetscape existing landscaping long distance views and other natural effects it is necessary that satellite antennas in residential zones be placed in the least obtrusive location upon residential properties while still allowing access to satellite signals the purpose of this ordinance is to establish criteria for the location of satellite antennas consistent
