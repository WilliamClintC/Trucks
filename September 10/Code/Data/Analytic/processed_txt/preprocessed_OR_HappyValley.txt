surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items i to xi inclusive in subsection d6d have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section c variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in this section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare g variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection d7 of this section conditions for variances and otherwise complies with a general standards h any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation  2008   1987  provisions for flood hazard reduction a general standards in all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required 1 anchoring a all new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation collapse or lateral movement of the structures resulting from hydrodynamic and

with c2 the applicant shall submit the following information regarding the real property lot or parcel a the information described in c1a e  and b a documented demonstration of the misalignment between the hca map and the propertys tax lot boundary lines for example an applicant could compare the boundary lot lines shown for roads within five hundred 500 feet of a property with the location of such roads as viewed on the aerial photograph of the area surrounding a property to provide evidence of the scale and amount of incongruity between the hca maps and the property lot lines and the amount of adjustment that would be appropriate to accurately depict habitat on the property 3 property developed between summer 2002 and  where a property was developed between the summer of 2002 when

described in b4 below 4 mitigation requirements for disturbance in hcas in order to achieve the goal of reestablishing forested canopy that meets the ecological values and functions described in tree replacement and vegetation planting are required when development intrudes into a hca according to the following standards except for wetlands mitigation requirements imposed by state and federal law a required plants and plant densities all trees shrubs and groundcover must be native plants selected from the happy valley plant list appendix a an applicant must meet mitigation option 1 or 2 whichever results in more tree plantings  except that where the disturbance area is one acre or more the applicant shall comply with mitigation option 2 i mitigation option 1 this mitigation requirement is calculated based on the number and size of trees that are removed from the site trees that are removed from the site shall be replaced as shown in table 3 conifers shall be replaced with conifers bare ground shall be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs nonnative sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs table 3 tree replacement size of tree to be removed inches in diameter number of trees and shrubs to be planted 6 to 12 2 trees and 3 shrubs 13 to 18 3 trees and 6 shrubs 19 to 24 5 trees and 12 shrubs 25 to 30 7 trees and 18 shrubs over 30 10 trees and 30 shrubs ii mitigation option 2 this mitigation requirement is calculated based on the size of the disturbance area within a hca native trees and shrubs are required to be planted at a rate of five trees and twentyfive 25 shrubs per every five hundred 500 square feet of disturbance area calculated by dividing the number of square feet of disturbance area by five hundred 500 and then multiplying that result times five trees and twentyfive 25 shrubs and rounding all fractions to the nearest whole number of trees and shrubs  for example if there will be 330 square feet of disturbance area then three hundred thirty 330 divided by five hundred 500 equals 66 and 66 times five equals 33 so three trees must be planted and 66 times twentyfive 25 equals 165 so seventeen 17 shrubs must be planted bare ground shall be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs nonnative sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs b plant size replacement trees must be at least onehalf inch in caliper measured at six inches above the ground level for field grown trees or above the soil line for container grown trees the onehalf inch minimum size may be an average caliper measure recognizing that trees are not uniformly round unless they are oak or madrone which may be one gallon size shrubs must be in at least a onegallon container or the equivalent in ball and burlap and must be at least twelve 12 inches in height c plant spacing trees shall be planted between eight and twelve 12 feet oncenter and shrubs shall be planted between four and five feet on center or clustered in single species groups of no more than four plants with each cluster planted between eight and ten 10 feet on center when planting near existing trees the dripline of the existing tree shall be the starting point for plant spacing measurements d plant diversity shrubs must consist of at least two different species if ten 10 trees or more are planted then no more than fifty 50 percent of the trees may be of the same genus e location of mitigation area all vegetation must be planted on the applicants site within the hca or in an area contiguous to the hca  provided however that if the vegetation is planted outside of the hca then the applicant shall preserve the contiguous area by executing a deed restriction such as a restrictive covenant in addition an offsite mitigation option is provided in a streamlined discretionary review process but in all cases mitigation shall be provided within the city of happy valley city limits f invasive vegetation invasive nonnative or noxious vegetation must be removed within the mitigation area prior to planting g tree and shrub survival a minimum of eighty 80 percent of the trees and shrubs planted shall remain alive on the fifth anniversary of the date that the mitigation planting is completed h monitoring and reporting monitoring of the mitigation site is the ongoing responsibility of the property owner plants that die must be replaced in kind the developer shall submit a twoyear maintenance bond covering the continued health and survival of all plantings i to enhance survival of the mitigation plantings the following practices are required i mulching mulch new plantings a minimum of three inches in depth and eighteen 18 inches in diameter to retain moisture and discourage weed growth ii irrigation water new plantings one inch per week between june 15th to october 15th for the three years following planting iii weed control remove or control nonnative or noxious vegetation throughout maintenance period j to enhance survival of tree replacement and vegetation plantings the following practices are recommended i planting season plant bare root trees between december 1st and february 28th and potted plants between october 15th and april 30th ii wildlife protection use plant sleeves or fencing to protect trees and shrubs against wildlife browsing and resulting damage to plants 5 standards for partitions subdivisions and puds the purpose of this section is to allow for partitions in a manner that limits the total amount of allowable development within hcas on the partitioned parcels  and to require that new subdivisionpud plats delineate and show the moderate and high hcas as a separate

three hundred thirty 330 square feet of disturbance area then three hundred thirty 330 divided by five hundred 500 equals 066 and 066 times five equals 33 so three trees must be planted and 066 times twentyfive 25 equals 165 so seventeen 17 shrubs must be planted bare ground must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs nonnative sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded in equal

and to promote a comprehensive identity for nonresidential developments within the community that are three stories or below in height application of the happy valley style appendix b and the standards of so that 1 the location size shape height and spatial and visual arrangement of the uses and among buildings building entrances existing and proposed structures are compatible with each other with consideration given to increased setbacks building heights shared parking common driveways and other similar design considerations  and 2 that there are interrelationships between transit stops transit facilities and routes parking and loading areas vehicular and pedestrian circulation open spaces landscaping and related activities and uses on the site b relationship to other standards

shelters etc as determined by the planning official 4 institutional office buildings and schools are exempted from h2 storefront appearance for commercial and office buildings e character of the happy valley style as described in more detail in of appendix b the happy valley style promotes a residential character for projects by drawing on features from certain historical architectural styles as well as use of complex massing and varied rooflines materials of the happy valley style draw on the pacific northwests natural resource heritage equally important to incorporating a residential character the happy valley style also promotes a pedestrian friendly environment using faade design that creates a storefront appearance at the ground level the overall development pattern should contribute to a sense of arrival and departure to and from the city core happy valleys unique topography and natural features should be incorporated into project design where feasible while it is influenced by historic architectural styles the goal of the happy valley style is not a literal replication of historic residential buildings but appropriate contemporary interpretation of timetested and proven design principles the happy valley style is also flexible enough to allow for variety acknowledging different needs and preferences of various uses projects do not need to include all features that make up the happy valley style however projects should reflect the styles characteristic elements in varying combinations f pedestrianoriented building siting standards in order to orient buildings to the pedestrians walking on the pedestrian network and to activate the pedestrian environment and emphasize pedestrian movements development shall meet the minimum standards in this section additional recommendations for pedestrianoriented building siting are included in of appendix b 1 maximum setback a at least fifty 50 percent of the building frontage must meet the maximum setback of eight feet from a property line along a public or private street b surface parking facilities and vehicular circulation facilities such as driveways and queues are prohibited between the

commission or city council may allow additional evidence testimony or argument concerning any standard criterion condition or issue relevant to the original application i reconsideration of permit approvals 1 purpose the ability to reconsider publicly a land use or limited land use approval provides an opportunity to determine if the use or development is in compliance with this chapter it also allows for clarification of prior land use approvals as part of this reconsideration the ability to add new conditions or revoke the approval provides a strong enforcement mechanism andor an opportunity to improve the terms of the development 2 situations when permit approvals may be reconsidered all quasijudicial land use and limited land use approvals and master plans except plan amendments and zone changes and those uses that become conditional uses or nonconforming uses due to a change of zoning regulations mapping or annexation may be reconsidered upon a request by the city manager to the city council a decision may be reconsidered by the city council if there is evidence of any of the following a one or more conditions of the approval have not been implemented or have been violated  b the activities of the use or the use itself are substantially different from what was approved  c the use is subject to the conditional use or nonconforming use regulations has not been subject to a conditional use or nonconforming use review and has substantially changed its activities or substantially increased the intensity of its operations since it became a conditional use or a nonconforming use  d when the city and the applicant agree that the approval terms andor conditions can be improved  and e reconsideration will not cause the city to violate the deadline for a final local decision ie the 120day deadline including any extensions requested by the applicant 3 initiating the reconsideration the city manager and designee may initiate a reconsideration if there is substantial evidence that one of the situations described applies to the use or development the evidence relied on shall be made part of the record the reconsideration may be initiated any time after thirty 30 days have passed from the first notice of violation pursuant to subparagraphs a b and c in the preceding paragraph 4 procedure for reconsideration by review authority a after initiation the reconsideration is processed using the public hearings procedure an application does not have to be submitted a preapplication conference is not required and a fee shall not be charged

be mailed at least twenty 20 days prior to the scheduled hearing written comments from the property owner applicant or operator shall be received fifteen 15 days prior to the public hearing date to be included in the staff report ii additional public notice in addition to people who are mailed notice pursuant to the public hearing procedure requirements people who have complained or otherwise provided comment or input in writing about the use or development shall also be mailed notice of the hearing 5 possible actions at the reconsideration hearing depending on the situation the review authority may take any of the actions described below the review authority may not approve the new use or one more intense than originally approved unless the possibility of this change has been stated in the public notice a uses or development which are alleged to have not fulfilled conditions or are alleged to be different from what was approved or which violate conditions are subject to the following actions i the review authority may find that the use or development is complying with the conditions of the approval in this case the use or development is allowed to continue ii the review authority may find that the use or development does not fully comply with the conditions of approval but that the violations are not substantial enough to warrant revocation and that the use can comply with the original approval criteria if the conditions are met in this case the review authority may modify the existing conditions add new conditions to ensure compliance with the approval criteria and refer the case to the city manager for enforcement of the existing conditions iii the review authority may revoke the approval if it finds that there are substantial violations of conditions or failure to implement conditions of prior land use decisions such that the original approval criteria for the use or development are not being met b where the city manager and the applicant convince the review authority that the development terms can be improved and the review authority so finds the review authority may modify the terms of development approval j reconsideration of conditional and nonconforming uses conditional uses and nonconforming uses that have not been subject to a land use review by the city are subject to the following actions 1 the review authority may find that the use and its activities including its intensity are consistent with what was on the site at the time it became a conditional or nonconforming use in this case the use may continue 2 the review authority may find that the use and its activities are substantially different from what was on the site at the time it became a conditional use or nonconforming use and that the differences do not comply with the current approval criteria for the site in this case the review authority may apply conditions or restrictions or require an application for a development permit to ensure that the differences comply with the approval criteria k enforcement of revocation in the event that the land use or limited land use approval is revoked the use or development becomes illegal the use or development shall be terminated within thirty 30 days of the date the revocation final order is signed by the city council unless the decision provides otherwise revocation actions are appealable pursuant to land use decision appeals the filing of an appeal shall stay the revocation action but not any other action taken by the city l use of new regulations or mapping applications

conferences may be requested and held m prior conditions of land use approvals 1 incorporating prior conditions of land use actions over time there are instances when uses or development previously approved with conditions are subject to new zoning regulations this may result from a change of the content of zoning regulations or from legislative zone changes including annexation rezonings this subsection addresses situations where a use or development was approved with conditions as a part of a land use or limited land use review under zoning regulations that no longer apply to the site the regulations stated below apply to all prior conditions of approval unless the conditions of approval or the ordinance adopting the conditions specifically refer to the situations outlined below and provide for the continuance of the conditions in that instance the conditions of approval will continue to apply 2 zone changes if a site is subject to conditions as the result of a zone change the conditions continue to apply if the site is rezoned to a comparable zone as part of an annexation rezoning or as part of a legislative remapping 3 conditional uses a an allowed conditional use if a use was an approved conditional use under the prior regulations and is a conditional use under the new regulations pertaining to the site any conditions of approval shall continue to apply b use allowed outright if the use is a permitted use the conditions of approval shall continue to apply c use no longer allowed if the use was a conditional use without an expiration date and is no longer allowed it becomes a nonconforming use under the new regulations and shall continue to meet the conditions as well as the nonconforming use regulations 4 variances if the variance was to a standard or regulation which is now allowed and the development on the site conforms with the current regulations then the prior variance conditions of approval no longer apply 5 other land use actions if the use

for calculating the overall density for any site that may contain both constrained land partially constrained land and unconstrained land the minimum and maximum number of dwelling units permitted on a site is limited by both the number of units allowed by the applicable zoning districts and the amount of buildable land the need to provide infrastructure and the presence of easements for major utilities corridor also impacts the number of units permitted on a site the shared outdoor recreation areas requirements of not affect the density calculations as outlined in table 1 density calculations steps 1 establish the maximum number of potential dwelling units allowed on a site given the zoning districts andor overlay districts however if site constraints are present there may not be enough buildable land capacity for all of the potential dwelling units to be constructed on site steps 5 establish capacity in terms of the number of dwelling units that can physically be built on a site given site constraints and available buildable land if as a result of constrained land or partially constrained land the total number of dwelling units generated is more than the capacity of the site the site may qualify for density transfer pursuant to subsection f2 1 for the purposes of calculating density land shall be categorized as follows a constrained land which includes any land

introduction the happy valley plant list is an integral component of the city of happy valleys natural resource protection program native plants identified on the list are required within the citys habitat conservation areas pursuant to of the land development   invasive or harmful plants identified on the nuisance or prohibited plant lists are prohibited happy valleys native plant policy is designed to ensure the continued viability and diversity of indigenous plant and animal communities promote the use of plants naturally adapted to local conditions and educate citizens about the regions natural heritage and the values and uses of native plants a healthy native plant community serves many important functions it provides habitat for native wildlife and preserves critical habitat for rare threatened and endangered animals and plants  enhances air and water quality by trapping airborne particulates and by filtering sediments and pollutants from runoff before they enter streams and aquifers  stabilizes stream banks and hillside slopes and dissipates erosive forces  ameliorates the local microclimate and reduces water and energy needs  and provides scenic recreational and educational values which in turn enhance happy valleys livability native plants are part of the regions natural heritage the three lists native nuisance and prohibited the happy valley plant list is divided into three sections native plants nuisance plants and prohibited plants these sections are summarized below the native plants section is a listing of native plants historically found in the portland region the list divides the plants into three groups trees and arborescent shrubs shrubs and ground covers for each group the list includes the scientific latin name of a species its common name its wetland indicator status and its associated habitat type the habitat types are wetland riparian forest forested slopes thicket grass and rocky the nuisance plants section is a listing of plants found in the portland region which can be removed manually without requiring further city review  other local state or federal laws may still regulate removal of certain plants on this list nuisance plants may be native naturalized or exotic they are divided into two groups plants which are considered a nuisance because of their tendency to dominate plant communities and plants which are considered harmful to humans each group identifies the scientific and common plant names and their indicator status the prohibited plants section is a listing of plants which the city of happy valley prohibits from use in all reviewed landscaping situations within the city limits these plant species pose a serious threat to the health and vitality of native plant and animal communities manual removal of these plants is exempt from land use review modification of lists plants may be added to or removed from the native plant list or nuisance plant list as follows when a request to amend either list is received the planning official will consult with three or more knowledgeable persons with botany biology or landscape architecture backgrounds to determine whether the requested change is warranted this decision will be forwarded to the applicant and will be final the primary source for native plant determination is the fivevolume set flora of the pacific northwest by hitchcock and cronquist adding to or removing plants from the prohibited plant list must be done legislative procedure as provided in of the land development plants this section provides a list of native plants historically found in the portland region the list divides plants into three groups trees and arborescent shrubs shrubs and ground covers arborescent shrubs are indicated with an  superscript the indicator status refers to the frequency with which a plant occurs in a wetland  the categories are derived from the list of plant species that occur in wetlands northwest region usfws biological report 88269 1988 the status of certain plants was revised using the 1993 supplement to the list for region 9 the indicator categories are as follows obligate wetland obl occur almost always estimated probability >99% under natural conditions in wetlands facultative wetland facw usually occur in wetlands estimated probability 67%99% but occasionally found in nonwetlands facultative fac equally likely to occur in wetlands or nonwetlands estimated probability 34%66% facultative upland facu usually occur in nonwetlands estimated probability 67%99% but occasionally found in wetlands estimated probability 1%33% obligate upland upl occur in wetlands in another region but occur almost always estimated probability >99% under natural conditions in nonwetlands in the northwest region a positive + sign used with an indicator category means that the plant occurs more frequently at the higher end of the range more frequently found in wetlands for example facw+ indicates that the plant is typically found in northwest wetlands with an estimated probability of 83%99% a negative  sign indicates a frequency toward the lower end of the range less frequently found in wetlands an ni no indicator was recorded for those species for which insufficient information was available to determine an indicator status if no category or symbol is indicated for a plant then either the plant does not occur in wetlands or the species was not reviewed by the 1988 or 1993 interagency panels that developed the list the habitat types are wetland riparian forest forested slopes thicket grass and rocky wetland includes all forms of wetlands found in portland riparian includes the riparian areas along the willamette and columbia rivers and other streams in portland forest refers to upland forested areas with little or no slope forested slopes refers to steeply sloping upland forests such as the west hills and various buttes found in portland thicket refers to edges of forests and meadows and includes hedgerows and clumps of vegetation that may be found in meadows grass refers to open areas or meadows it may also include clearings in forested areas rocky refers to rocky upland areas and may include cliffs the information on habitat types is intended to provide general guidance for appropriate planting locations  certain plants however have highly specialized habitats which may make them appropriate for use only in specific areas of the region for this reason it may be helpful to consult with local botanists or published sources when preparing a planting plan sources of native plants native plants can be acquired local and specialty plant nurseries in the portland area a useful native plant directory hortus northwest is available by writing hortus northwest po box 955 canby or 97013 occasionally particularly for large orders or less common plants growers will need time to propagate and raise plants before they are ready for installation for this reason growers may need advance notice of plant orders and project timelines should allow adequate time to fill such orders native groundcovers ab scientific name common name indicator status habitat type wetland
