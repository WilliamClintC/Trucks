2weighting criteriareview mechanism3039 introduction the proposed orland parkeconomic development strategy details a number of steps to enhance market penetration of orland park in order to stimulate job creation and private investment the strategy is particularly oriented to encourage investment in specifically designated geographical areas and types of business activity as determined by the advisory board of trustees the first step in the overall strategy is the creation of the economic development loan program the above is patterned basically after the successful federal program  the urban development action grant program udag administered by the department of housing and urban development the udag program allows for the creation of publicprivate partnerships to induce job creation and investments as such private dollars must be in place in order for the public funds to be committed to the project the use of public monies for this economic development loan program serves three critical purposes 1provides a ready and visible source of funds for encouraging investment in the village by developers and industries 2improves tax base investments payrolls and spinoff investments 3demonstrates strong local economic development capacity proper utilization of currently unrestricted funds of the village enables orland park to leverage such monies in a manner determined by program criteria similar to the udag program as a result village participation will be contingent upon the private developerfirm committing to a certain level of investment job creation and operation evidence of the above would be furnished by the developerfirm  while complemented by analysis of staff and the review of evidentiary materials submitted  in order to determine conformance with village policy and program objectives  the decision would be made by the economic development advisory board and finally the advisory board of trustees as to the funding of the individual projects objectives of orland parks economic development loan program tax base the use of public monies is directly related to tax base every effort will be made to insure that the expenditure of village funds results in increased private investment the increased investment is expected to generate revenues in the form of new real estate taxes sales tax and repayment of revolving loans in short the villages concern will be to develop practical and effective approaches to stimulating capital investment that enlarges the tax base the broadened tax base is necessary to maintain and expand essential public services sustain orland park communities and neighborhoods and general infrastructure necessary to a healthy economy jobs jobs are and will be one of the main objectives the program will seek to retain private sector jobs in the village to foster and sustain job growth in industrial concerns to attract new firms to the village and to help firms within orland park expand their business opportunities enhance development in key sectors of the village the advisory board of trustees desires to optimize utilization of village land ways that complement overall policy objectives of the village in particular the village has acquired a large parcel of land upon which certain municipal facilities will be erected and is desirous of promoting complemental private uses of residual portions of the land  uses which will provide additional taxes to defray operating costs of municipal services and uses which will result in achievement of a longterm objective of this area becoming a true village center additionally the village has identified certain other strategically located areas whose potential for industrial andor commercialoffice development is significant and desires to see such areas developed in accordance with standards which meet overall village objectives selfsufficiency the village recognizes that federal and state monies once available to assist in private development efforts have been significantly constrained in order to control its own destiny and assure residents of quality development the village views the economic development loan program as a mechanism to assist in continuing strong and desired development in this respect the village will be better able to control its own destiny  without requiring dependence on dwindling federal or state monies approach to orland parks economic development loan program overview to be successful in meeting these key objectives orland park must prepare to compete in an increasingly difficult economic environment elements of the program must address both actual cost factors for business and the perceptions which surround capital investment and real estate for the longer run this means that the program must aim at enlisting the private sector not solely in form of civic duty but in business interest advantages which orland park has visavis its surrounding environment orland park brings to the economic competition some significant advantages which will enable it to impact substantially upon the local economy  namely  its powers as a home rule unit of government under

the work necessary to implement such a program has already been initiated or put in process by the village its staff and its consultants visible results a program with early successes a vital element in launching a program which captures the confidence of the private sector is that the program bring early and visible results this means that we must concentrate scarce development resources and sufficiently target such resources to gain early program success clearly such achievements will affect the perception of investors lenders and development specialists who can begin to see strong market advantage to an orland park location a key element of the overall development strategy then is the development of a positive market psychology with sufficiently welldefined targets the village is confident that it can spur business investment at a large enough scale to gain major development momentum creation and organization of the economic development program creation of the revolving

on data and policy in the villages comprehensive plan which recommends a ratio of ten 10 acres of active parks per 1000 residents of the ten 10 acres five 5 acres are designated for neighborhood parks and five 5 acres are designated for community parks the capital improvement cost of village parks averaged $90000 per acre in 1996 the fee schedule is $45000 per acre in 199 $67500 in 199 and $90000 in 1998 because neighborhood parks are intended to contain facilities for immediately surrounding residents and because the need for new neighborhood parks is generated by new residents new housing development is being required by these regulations to pay 100% of land and capital costs it is presumed that other revenues will pay for maintenance and services in the new neighborhood parks because community parks serve all residents new housing development is only being required by these regulations to pay forty percent 40% of land and capital costs it is presumed that other revenues will pay

architectural styles of buildings in the historic district are described with examples below while some buildings have elements of many other architectural styles they were classified under the predominant style national 18351895 national is the term given to indigenous forms of building construction some refer to national buildings as vernacular style although buildings continued to be constructed according to the earlier traditional folk forms the increased availability of lumber millsawn lumber was available after 1850 led to some new shape innovations folk form or vernacular buildings are typically of frame construction and covered with wood siding some may have details taken from high styles such as greek revival or colonial revival  others may have later high style modifications some of the many variants of the vernacular identified in the survey area are fouroverfour a side gable two story center entry house two rooms deep and two rooms wide example 9830 w

form was particularly common in new england and its popularity expanded along the with the expansion of the railroad network and remained a dominant folk form until well into the 20th century its staying power reflected the fact that gablefront houses were well suited for narrow urban lots which were found in many rapidly developing cities examples 14438 second avenue left 9953 w 143rd street 14329 beacon avenue 14420 first avenue and 9856 w 144th place gabled l this house form also descended from styled greek revival houses and the gablefront form this variant shows an additional

commercial vernacular or storefront 20th century commercial and residential buildings converted to commercial uses the storefront type is characterized by a false front faade which is a front wall that extends above the roof andor beyond the sides of the building to create a more imposing faade the typically gabled roof can be seen behind the cornice of the false front in the district these buildings are of wood the facades are sited at the lot line and are composed of a storefront at ground level and an upper story that is topped with a cornice or parapet these buildings often have decorative features in the italianate style   20th century commercial buildings are also defined by their form but are typically masonry with storefront at ground level and an upper story that is topped with a cornice these buildings may also have decorative features of other architectural styles in the district these buildings are of brick with stone decorative details and have a flat roof typically hidden behind a low parapet wall commercial buildings converted from an original residential use should respect the design character and scale of the original buildings good examples of

technical guidance manual tgm abioswale a bioswale is a shallow drainage conveyance trench or shoulder with a gentle slope designed to slowly transport and treat runoff a swale looks similar to a ditch but is slightly wider and may use berms andor check dams to promote settling and infiltration bflowthrough planter a flowis a structure or container placed above or below ground and filled with gravel soil and vegetation runoff is temporarily stored above the soil and slowly filters down water that is not absorbed by the soils or plants is collected in a perforated pipe at the bottom of the planter and routed to a drain system or network of planters these are effective for compact sites next to building foundations or other locations where infiltration may be problematic or soils are poordraining floware permitted for all commercial sites cgreen roof ecoroof a green roof uses living plant material as part of the roofing system green roofs generally include a waterproof membrane root barrier thermal insulation drainage system filter layer growing medium and living plant material the plants roots and soil filters detain and absorb rainwater slowing cleansing and cooling the runoff roof gardens can be either extensive soil depths three to four inches or intensive soil depths six inches or greater green roofs are permitted in all zoning districts dinfiltration planters an infiltration planter is a structure or container with an open bottom that is filled with a layer of soil and vegetation runoff is diverted into the planter and temporarily stored above the soil before infiltrating down into existing soils this can be employed in spacelimited sites where runoff is received by a piped inlet or sheetflow such as parking lot islands plazas and walkways if the soil does not drain well or infiltration is not desired a perforated pipe underdrain can connect to storm sewers or defined stabilized discharge point infiltration trench an infiltration trench is a shallow trench filled with stone sand or rock to create a small reservoir for runoff until it infiltrates into the soil or is released slowly into a storm drain system usually over a period of several days underground infiltration trenches are effective for compact sites with limited space trenches should be covered with stone grass and small plants or shrubs to better incorporate into the urban landscape shallow wide trenches as opposed to narrow deep trenches are best for removing pollutants enative landscaping see landscape and tree preservation amd 1816 fpermeable pavers a series of interlocking concrete pavers that contain drainage voids for passing runoff to the subsurface where the water is further conveyed materials into the ground or storm drain system permeable pavers can be used in parking lots private roads and private sidewalks where no chemicals or other hazardous materials are used in areas where soils do not drain freely permeable pavement can be used in combination with subsurface storm drain systems gporous pavement porous pavement is a mixed and placed hard surface that allows water to infiltrate across the entire area the pavement is made without fine sand or small aggregate to create void spaces that allow rain and snow melt to pass a bed of opengraded aggregate beneath the pervious pavement storm water is then stored until it infiltrates into the underlying soils permeable paving should not be used in areas with the potential for high pollutant loads or high traffic high speed because its loadbearing capacity is typically less than conventional pavement hrain barrels rain barrels are designed to collect storm water from residential single family home and condominium rooftops and stored for later irrigation and nonpotable uses in buildings rain barrels that contain up to 55 gallons are permitted in all zoning districts 1setbacks rain barrels may project up to three 3 feet beyond the established building side and rear yard setbacks irain garden bioretention a rain garden is a shallow depression that captures storm water runoff from roofs driveways streets and parking lots allowing it to infiltrate into the soil these gardens typically utilize a modified soil mixture to ensure that the gardens soak up the water within a twoday period many are designed to have overflow outlet during heavy rainfall events rain gardens may be planted with shrubs perennials or native wildflowers and grasses to increase infiltration and attract biodiversity rain gardens typically absorb 30% more storm water than conventional lawns rain gardens are permitted in all zoning districts jstorm water cisterns storm water cisterns are designed to collect storm water runoff from nonresidential and mixeduse rooftops and stored for later irrigation and nonpotable uses in buildings above ground storm water cisterns that contain up to 10000 gallons are permitted in the lspd biz cor vc ori mfg and r4 zoning districts 1height storm

side and rear yard setbacks a cistern may not locate between the building and the rightofway 3appearance stor m water cistern colors must match existing building colors and the system must be integrated as an architectural feature kunderground storm water cistern dry well an underground storm water cistern dry well is a process where storm water runoff is funneled into an underground rockfilled trench or vault temporarily detained and infiltrated back into the surrounding soils dry wells can reduce the volume of storm water runoff generated by the roofs of structures a significant source of runoff volume that enters storm drain systems they can also potentially recharge local aquifers by diverting storm water into the soils dry wells should be placed near areas that accumulate standing water or receive rooftop runoff from gutter downspouts they can be manufactured made by filling a trench with stone and gravel or utilize a perforated pipe made of concrete or plastic and surrounded by gravel 610 ioutside storage outside storage shall be located at the rear of the principal building it shall be screened on all sides stored materials equipment or vehicles shall not

of wind technologies on nonresidential proper ties in the village they are adaptable systems that can easily be retrofitted onto existing infrastructure and provide opportunities for distributed energy generation without large monopoles turbines new infrastructure or much visual or acoustic impact miniwecs such as those in figures a and b at left demonstrate rooftop turbines for nonresidential and mixeduse buildings figure a is a horizontal aeroturbine that lays on rooftops such turbines usually require a minimum amount of rooftop square footage to obtain the necessary capacity they also need open spaces that are not blocked by rooftop mechanicals parapets or other potential wind obstructions large wide and tall rooftops are appropriate locations for these figure b is a standup roofmounted turbine that extends higher than the roofline this turbine is more adaptable as it can be raised vertically to access wind above any potential obstructions miniwecs can also on occasion be freestanding re newable energy systems as depicted in figure c mixeduse districts are often diverse areas that can accommodate infrastructure that is typically not found in singleuse districts in figure c the monopole stands among mixeduse and multifamily residential structures figures d and e demonstrate concepts to utilize existing vertical infrastructure for miniwecs distribution mounted on parking lot or street light poles miniwecs can take advantage of height and wideopen spaces such infrastructure can offset the energy used to light parking lots or streets at night or to generate power to sell back to the utility and reduce peak energy demand in some cases existing light poles may not structurally accommodate wind turbines such light poles will have to be rebuilt to accommodate the extra height and wind loads associated with turbines the rebuilt systems would be miniwecs with parking lot or street lights rather than street lights with miniwecs such a conversion would be a colocation since the new infrastructure would replace similar infrastructure  3swecs small scale wind energy conversion systems 10 kw to 100 kw can be accessory uses they are

for a uwecs in orland park and they must lo cate near transmission lines to be effective uwecs are not permitted to locate within 500 feet of residential uses due to their scale height is often determined by surrounding obstructions and prevailing wind patterns the height of these turbines however is often no greater than some existing wireless communication cell towers water towers and radio antennas setbacks from specific land uses typically mitigate visual and acoustic impacts of turbines they tend to be no more of a nuisance than wireless communication towers 5general

significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soil limitations in their natural state nontidal wetlands serve man and nature they provide habitat areas for fish wildlife and vegetation waterquality maintenance and pollution control flood control shoreline erosion control natural resource education scientific study open space and recreation opportunities a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining dredging filling excavation building pollution and other acts piecemeal or cumulative losses may over time destroy remaining wetlands damaging or destroying nontidal wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare it is therefore necessary for the village to ensure maximum protection for nontidal wetlands by discouraging development activities in nontidal wetlands and those activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely affect nontidal wetlands and to encourage restoration of already degraded or destroyed systems 595 bpurpose it is the policy of the village of orland park to encourage or require planning to avoid or minimize damage to nontidal wetlands wherever prudent or feasible  to require that activities not dependent upon a nontidal wetland location be located at upland sites  to allow nontidal wetland losses only when such losses are in the public interest and after all practicable measures have been applied to reduce those losses to the unavoidable minimum  to provide for compensation in the form of nontidal wetland restoration or creation to offset further losses furthermore any activities in a wetland must not threaten public safety or cause nuisances by 1blocking flood flows destroying flood storage areas or destroying storm barriers thereby raising flood heights or velocities on other land and increasing flood damages  2causing water pollution means including location of wastewater disposal systems in wet soils  unauthorized application of pesticides herbicides and algacides  disposal of solid wastes or stormwater runoff directly into a wetland site  or creation of unstabilized fills  3increasing erosion  or 4increasing runoff of sediment and stormwater in addition it is the policy of the village not to permit activities in or affecting nontidal wetlands that could destroy natural wetland functions important to the general welfare by
