leandro does hereby determine that the cost to provide emergency medical services at a level required to provide for the health safety and general welfare of its residents exceeds the amount of funds and revenues generated from all other sources of income available for such purpose the city council does further determine that the imposition of an emergency medical services tax on occupants of real property throughout the city as set forth below is necessary to maintain an adequate level of emergency medical services b the imposition of an emergency medical services tax will allow the city to continue to provide paramedic level of service the county of alameda in an effort to deal with the rising costs or maintaining the transport ambulance system throughout alameda county has had to increase the response times for the paramedic transport ambulances the city of san leandro established the paramedic engine company program in an effort to ensure that the residents or san leandro would receive a timely response of paramedics to all medical emergencies within the city the emergency medical services tax will also enable the city to continue funding the following programs which support the paramedic program ems quality assurancequality improvement qaqi ems coordinator ems equipment ems certification ems training ems related community training paramedic services authorized first responder defibrillation improved dispatch emergency medical dispatch records management systems traffic control systems vehicles for specific ems purposes disaster rescue and medical equipment communications equipment improvements c the council recognizes that occupants of different categories of property use different amounts of emergency medical services the tax rates established by this intended to be proportional to and based on estimates of typical use of and benefit from essential services the rates are not tailored to individual use within categories of property both because such tailoring is not administratively feasible and because the city must make emergency medical services available to all residents equally d the tax is based on a benefit unit with different land uses assigned a different number of benefit units the weighted land use classification system was developed in 1983 by the alameda county emergency medical services district ems district and the alameda county assessor under this classification system benefit units were assigned to various land use types based on a countywide survey of the demand for service generated by the land use nonresidential uses are assigned benefit units based on use ranging from two 2 to seven 7 e individual occupants typically do not choose whether or when to avail themselves of emergency medical services which are relied on in emergencies or unexpected circumstances the value of such services is in their availability to all residents and it would be unfair to charge their costs only to those residents who actually use the services f each occupant of property derives value from the availability of emergency medical services even if such services are not presently used by an occupant the services may be used in the future and in any event their availability benefits each occupant such services enhance the health safety welfare and environment of all residents of san leandro and improve their quality of life both directly and indirectly g parcels which are unimproved contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services accordingly the council has determined that owners of unimproved parcels are not subject to the tax h parcels which are improved but vacant contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services accordingly the council has determined that owners of vacant improved parcels may receive a refund of the tax if they can prove that the parcel was vacant rot more than six 6 months during the twelve 12 month tax period i approximately fiftyeight and onehalf percent 585% of san leandros residential units are owneroccupied because these percentages are so high the overall tax impact is not significantly different if the tax is imposed on occupants as opposed to owners however nothing in this is intended to preclude owners from recovering the tax from the occupant whether the occupant is charged depends solely upon the terms of the occupancy agreement moreover nonpayment will not be a lien on the property but a personal obligation of the occupant or owner j it is not feasible for san leandro to collect the tax from the nonowner occupants on whom it is imposed because the records available to the city do not include the names of nonowner occupants therefore the only practical way to collect a tax imposed on occupants is to collect it from the owners of the occupied properties k the tax imposed by this a tax on the privilege or using and the use of emergency medical services it is not an ad valorem tax on real property nor is it any other kind of tax on property or the ownership of property it is not a transaction or sales tax on the sale or real property finally because the tax proceeds are deposited in a special fund and the fund is restricted for emergency medical services the tax is a special tax 213120 definitions as used herein the following definitions shall apply a emergency medical services

acknowledged by the federal september 11 commission in its investigation finding that deficiencies that existed resulted in impaired response subscribers to telephone service derive significant benefit from ongoing operation of the modernized integrated system installed at the san leandro police department and alameda county fire department telephone subscribers will benefit from operating maintaining and upgrading the 911 communication system so it continues to operate at a stateoftheart level a portion of the costs associated with operating maintaining and upgrading the 911 communications system and facility should be allocated among all telephone subscribers because telephone subscribers will reap this significant benefit b every telephone access line can provide independent access to the 911 communication system therefore allocating operating costs on a per line basis fairly distributes these costs according to the benefit telephone subscribers derive from availability of a modernized 911 communication system c the concentration of a large number of access lines in a single location diminishes the marginal benefit of improved access provided by each additional access line  therefore it is appropriate to place a cap on the number of access lines per account per service location on which the tax is charged d subscribers who maintain super trunk

article 6 variance procedure 79600 nature of variances a the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city of san leandro to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 79605 appeal board a the city council of the city of san leandro shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this b the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this c in passing upon such applications the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this   and the following 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d generally

necessary to further the purposes of this f any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of

technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of san leandro need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of san leandro believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause  determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this  to the applicant  and determination

persons with mental or physical disabilities including persons recovering from drug andor alcohol addiction often benefit from living in a noninstitutional residential environment which is frequently costeffective and more humane and therapeutic the council also finds that under the federal fair housing act 42 usc 3601 et seq the city has an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation for the disabled including changing waiving and making exceptions to zoning rules that would otherwise have the effect of limiting the ability of such individuals to live in the residence of their choice in the community the council further finds that the preservation and protection of the character of residential neighborhoods is in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare and that overconcentration of residential facilities for the individuals listed above can impair the character of residential neighborhoods thereby defeating the very reason for providing residential accommodations for such individuals thus the council concludes that a set of land use laws that flexibly limits the concentration of residential facilities for the individuals listed above can balance the citys complementary interests in reasonably accommodating disabled individuals seeking a residential living environment and in preserving the character of residential neighborhoods the purpose of this section is to enact such a law in enacting this law the council has attempted to achieve the goals described above by removing any special requirements for facilities for the disabled that would limit such individuals choice of places to live  to the extent that such residences are subject to requirements different from those applicable to similar uses of land the council has concluded that no less discriminatory alternatives exist that would as effectively promote its interests in reasonable accommodation and the preservation of residential neighborhoods b residential congregate care

districts in which residential uses are either permitted conditionally permitted or subject to administrative review and subject to the limitations prescribed in this section c applicability of

minimum spacing requirement pursuant to this section public notices shall provide notice as set forth in public hearing 2 findings requiring denial of request all applications for adjustment to the minimum spacing requirement pursuant to this section shall be granted unless the board of zoning adjustments finds all of the following a that the proposed residential congregate care facility at the location being requested would impose an undue administrative or financial burden on the city  b that the proposed residential congregate care facility at the location being requested would effect a fundamental change in the nature of the neighborhood in which it proposes to locate  and c that the proposed residential congregate care facility at the location being requested would significantly compromise the citys interest in maintaining either the residential character of the surrounding neighborhood or reasonable accommodation to disabled persons seeking a residential living environment 3 adjustment review process does not limit number of facilities the board of zoning adjustments shall neither interpret nor enforce this subsection in a manner which creates a ceiling quota on the number of residential congregate care facilities that may locate in the city or impose limitations beyond those prescribed by as to the number of persons who may live in such facilities 4 ability to

not to create significant risks or cause adverse impacts to the health and safety of populations in surrounding public and private areas as determined by a health and safety assessment a health and safety assessment by a qualified preparer is required for a proposed facility prior to approval of a local permit to provide technical and environmental evaluation of the proposed facility site and surrounding area a health and safety assessment will provide the information and analysis needed to demonstrate compliance of the proposed facility with the siting criteria the scope of the assessment will vary according to the size type and proposed location of the facility it is not intended that the health and safety assessment duplicate information developed for environmental impact reports or risk assessments required under local state or federal regulations when environmental impact reports and health risk assessments are required their scopes should provide the information and analysis required and thereby suffice for the health and safety assessment ii the health and safety assessment shall evaluate the potential impact of the proposed facility on existing and planned residences and immobile populations at minimum the buffer area prescribed by the alameda county hazardous waste management plan immobile populations include those in schools hospitals convalescent homes jails and other similar facilities within the area of potential impact the health and safety assessment must consider the quantities and the physical and chemical characteristics of the specific types of waste that would be handled the facility design features and planned operations practices the justification for any reduction in buffer areas of the facility from residential areas or immobile populations than that prescribed by the alameda county hazardous waste management plan will be identified the assessment must include a hydrologic evaluation and must assess risks due to physical hazards such as flooding and earthquakes and potential water or air pollution the assessment will detail credible potential accidents including the distance over which effects would carry a variety of options for reducing risks and procedures for dealing with the effects the assessment will identify the capabilities including equipment and trained personnel and response times of existing emergency services with regard to accidents at the facility and will provide an emergency evacuation plan if existing emergency services are deemed inadequate the local agency may require the developer to supplement those services with onsite trained personnel and equipment iii avoidance or mitigation of potential significant health or safety risks must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local permitting agency and the california department of health services b distance from populations all facilities facilities shall comply with local minimum zoning unless a greater buffer distance from other uses is deemed necessary based on a required health and safety assessment 2 ensure the structural stability of the facility a floodplains i all facilities facilities must be designed constructed operated and maintained to preclude failure due to flooding per flood control authorities and requirements provisions must be made to contain and test storm runoff prior to discharge in areas subject to contamination by waste or treated material the required health and safety assessment will address flooding risks associated with the facility ii treatment recycling and collection facilities facilities may be located in areas subject to 100 year flooding only if protected by offsetting engineered improvements such as berms or raising the facility above flood levels this includes areas

20 percent or more and by five spaces or berths or more 2 change in use for the purpose of determining compliance with paragraph 1 above a change of use shall be considered to occur only when a new occupancy andor new activity falls under a different use classification category than the former use the use classification categories are as set forth in street parking and loading spaces required and are as follows residential general  residential singlefamily  residential twofamily  residential mixeduse and multifamily  public and semipublic  commercial  and industrial a change of occupancy andor activity that is within the same use classification category as the former use is not subject to the requirements to provide additional parking unless the zoning enforcement official determines

residential density bonus inclusionary housing  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to a encourage the development and availability of housing affordable to a broad range of households with varying income levels within the city as mandated by state law california government et seq  b promote the citys goal to add affordable housing units to the citys housing stock in proportion to the overall increase in new jobs and housing units  c offset the demand on housing that is created by new development and mitigate environmental and other impacts that accompany new residential and commercial development by protecting the economic diversity of the citys housing stock reducing traffic transit and related air quality impacts promoting jobshousing balance and reducing the demands placed on transportation infrastructure in the region  and d increase the supply of affordable ownership and rental housing in san leandro as identified in the established housing element goal 53 affordable housing development policy 5304 of goal 53 requires the inclusion of affordable housing in new housing developments     findings the city council finds and determines a both california and the city face a serious housing problem that threatens their economic security lack of access to affordable housing has a direct impact upon the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city the city will not be able to contribute to the attainment of state housing goals or to retain a healthy environment without additional affordable housing the housing problem has an impact upon a broad range of income groups including many who are not impoverished by standards other than those applicable to californias and the citys housing markets and no single housing program will be sufficient to meet the housing need b rising land prices along with limited available land have been key factors in preventing development of new affordable housing new housing construction in the city which does not include affordable units aggravates the existing shortage of affordable housing by absorbing the supply of available residential land this reduces the supply of land for affordable housing and increases the price of remaining residential land at the same time new housing contributes to the demand for goods and services in the city increasing local service employment at wage levels which do not permit employees to afford housing in the city providing the affordable units required by this ordinance will help to insure that part of the citys remaining developable land is used to provide affordable housing c the citys adopted housing element has determined that 35 percent to 40 percent of the households in the city have very low or low incomes there is an affordability gap for low and very low income households in san leandro for both rental and for sale units among city groups identified in the housing element with especially significant housing needs are large and extended families also currently there are limited housing choices for young adults or singles within san leandro d development of new commercial projects and marketrate housing encourages new residents to move to the city these new residents will place demands on services provided by both public and private sectors some of these employees earn incomes only adequate to pay for affordable housing not market rate housing because affordable housing is in short supply within the city these employees may be forced to live in less than adequate housing within the city pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to live in adequate housing within the city or commute everincreasing distances to their jobs from housing located outside the city these circumstances harm the citys ability to attain goals articulated in the citys general plan e a lack of new inclusionary units will have a substantial negative impact on the environment and economic climate because 1 housing will have to be built elsewhere far from employment centers and therefore commutes will increase causing increased traffic and transit demand and consequent noise and air pollution  and 2 city businesses will find it more difficult to attract and retain the workers they need inclusionary housing policies contribute to a healthy job and housing balance by providing more affordable housing close to employment centers f the california legislature has required each local government agency to develop a comprehensive longterm general plan establishing policies for future development as specified in the government at c and 65583c the plan must 1 encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels including multifamily rental housing  2 assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low and moderateincome households  and 3 conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock which may include addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling units demolished by public or private action g the citizens of the city seek a wellplanned aesthetically pleasing and balanced community with housing affordable to very low low and moderateincome households affordable housing should be available throughout the city and not restricted to a few neighborhoods and areas therefore our primary goal with this policy is to have diverse housing however there may also be tradeoffs where constructing affordable units at a different site than the site of the principal project may produce a greater number of affordable units without additional costs to the project applicant thus the city finds that in certain limited circumstances the purposes of this chapter may be better served by allowing the developer to comply with the inclusionary requirement means such as development of offsite housing or dedication of land for example if a project applicant can produce a significantly greater number of affordable units offsite it may but not always be in the best interest of the city to permit the development of affordable units at a different location than that of the principal project h federal and state funds for the construction of new affordable housing are insufficient to fully address the problem of affordable housing within the city nor has the private housing market provided adequate housing opportunities affordable to moderate low and very lowincome households       definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the following meanings a affordable rent means monthly rent that does
