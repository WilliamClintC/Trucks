effect of this chapter  2019 manufactured home fair practices commission  preamble a limited manufactured home park space there is presently within the city and surrounding communities a shortage of rental spaces for the location of manufactured homes relative to the demand therefor this limited market situation has resulted in low vacancy rates and contributes or threatens to contribute to rapidly escalating rents this situation has resulted or threatens to result in financial hardship serious concern anguish and stress among a significant portion of santee residents living in manufactured home parks b inability to relocate alternative sites for the relocation of manufactured homes are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces the restrictions on the age size or style of manufactured homes permitted in many parks and requirements related to the installation of manufactured homes including permits landscaping and site preparation additionally the cost for moving a manufactured home is substantial and the risk of damage in moving is significant the result of these conditions creates a captive situation for manufactured home owners this immobility in turn contributes to the creation of a monopolistic market and great imbalance in the bargaining position of the park owners and manufactured home owners in favor of the park owners c unreasonable rent increases manufactured home owners are property owners with sizeable investments in their manufactured homes and appurtenances collectively the manufactured home owners often have a greater investment than does the manufactured home park owner the continuing possibility of unreasonable space rental increases in manufactured home parks threatens to diminish the value of the investment of the manufactured home owners further existing state law permits manufactured home park owners to require manufactured home owners to make reasonable modifications to their homes or spaces for safety purposes landscaping or conformity to park maintenance standards that amount to capital improvements which accrue to the benefit of the park owner by potentially increasing the market value of the park itself d facilitation of bargaining the people of the city of santee find and declare it necessary to facilitate and encourage fair bargaining between manufactured home owners and park owners in order to achieve mutually satisfactory agreements regarding space rental rates in manufactured home parks absent such agreements the people further find and declare it necessary to protect the owners of manufactured homes from unreasonable space rental increases while simultaneously recognizing and providing for the need of the park owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their property

juvenile crime in the city the city finds that juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gangrelated activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime recent local statistics regarding juvenile crime and victimization indicate that enforcement of a curfew for juveniles decreases juvenile victimization and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes during curfew hours the city council believes that having an enforceable juvenile curfew ordinance is critical to preserving the public health safety and welfare b the city further finds and determines that juveniles are repeatedly detained and supervised by law enforcement personnel for violating curfew and that daytime loitering laws impose an extraordinary burden on the resources of law enforcement because juveniles taken into custody by law enforcement personnel must be supervised in an unsecured area of the law enforcement station until they are released to a parent law enforcement personnel who supervise detained juveniles are then unavailable to carry out law enforcement duties in the field which decreases the level of police protection

the city incurs to provide extraordinary law enforcement services to respond to detain and supervise repeat curfew and daytime loitering violators  2019  curfew for juveniles it is unlawful for any

that the city of santee is required by california assembly bill 1881 to adopt a water efficient landscape ordinance that is at least as effective at conserving water as the california model water efficient landscape   2 that some areas of the city of santee have an established recycled water infrastructure  3 that water purveyors with service areas within the city of santee with water budgetbased allocations and tiered rate structures allow the city of santee to document water use in landscapes  4 that current local design practices in new landscapes typically already achieve the state model water efficient landscape use goals in many cases  5 that most city services are metered and all new construction will be metered where service is available from local water purveyors  6 that landscape plan submittal and review has been a long standing practice in the city of santee  7 that the local water purveyors are implementing tieredrate billing water budgeting public education programs and enforcement of water waste prohibitions for all existing and new metered landscape areas throughout their service areas which include the majority of the city of santee  8 implementation of tiered rate structures by the local water purveyors have resulted in a reduction in water use that exceeds the target reduction established by the san diego county water authority  9 that those areas of the city of santee that are not located within the service areas of the local water purveyors obtain water service groundwater supplies  10 over irrigating landscaping can potentially wash pollutants into the storm drain system by contrast appropriately designed and managed landscaping can be used to treat andor infiltrate stormwater before it is discharged to the storm drain system  11 that this chapter is consistent with the policies established by the land use element of the general plan in that it encourages the use of recycled water and is an update of the landscape design standards for future development  12 that this chapter is consistent with the policies established by the conservation element of the general plan in that it encourages the use of droughtresistant vegetation and recycled water for irrigation for private development as well as public projects and facilities  13 that this chapter is at least as effective at conserving water as the state model water efficient landscape a this chapter is applicable to all landscapes identified in the applicability section of the state model b this chapter requires the most efficient and appropriate

eto data or soil moisture sensors d this chapter establishes a maximum applied water allowance mawa based on an evapotranspiration adjustment factor etaf of 055 for residential landscapes 045 for nonresidential landscapes and 10 for new and existing nonrehabilitated special landscape areas e this chapter prohibits overspray and requires that new landscape areas be designed to retain storm runoff including from impervious surfaces such as roofs and paved surfaces and allow rainfall to permeate f this chapter includes audit and maintenance provisions that meet the minimum requirements of the state model g this chapter requires a landscape documentation package that complies with state model as part of this package plants are grouped into hydrozones h this chapter requires the use of recycled water where it is available i this chapter requires a minimum of three inches of mulch in all landscape areas except for those which contain turf or creeping or rooting groundcovers as specified in the state model j this chapter requires that the soil be assessed and amended if necessary prior to planting k this chapter incorporates mechanisms such as a tiered rate structure by local water purveyors penalties for water waste and allows irrigation surveys and audits and water use analyses to ensure compliance with requirements of this chapter l landscape guidelines have been drafted to provide further information for project applicants in the implementation of this chapter b the state legislature has found 1 that the waters of the state of california are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  2 that continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 that it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in the city of santee by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  6 that of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use c consistent with these findings the purpose of the city of santee water efficient landscape to establish an alternative ordinance at least as effective as the state model the context of conditions in the city of santee in order to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate stormwater runoff retention and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  5 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies  6 encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water such as implementing a tieredrate structure d landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this chapter conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and esthetic benefits 2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3 conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment 4 protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced materials and using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion 5 protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants climate adapted nonnatives and avoiding invasive plants utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action  2019  applicability a this chapter shall apply to all of
