recreational areas and amenities in the form of neighborhood and community parks as a function of residential development in the city of la porte this section is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city of la porte granted under the texas constitution and statutes of the state of texas including without limitation vtca local government et seq and   et seq it is hereby declared by the city council of the city of la porte that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks and related amenities and improvements are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such requirement into the procedure for planning and development of property of a residential subdivision in the city of la porte whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas neighborhood and community parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby the standards for which are set forth in the la porte parks recreation and open space master plan or neighborhood and community areas the park zones established by the la porte parks and recreation department and shown on the official la porte parks recreation and open space master plan or neighborhood area shall be prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby the cost of the neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities therefore the following requirements are adopted to effect such purposes in order to provide an equitable method of determination of the requirements for future development of residential areas of the city of la porte the following formula is hereby adopted the population of the city based on the latest united states census data adjusted on an annual basis based on the predicted growth of the city as found in the parks and open space master plan for the year in which the adjustment is made is identified the resultant number is divided by the number of acres of available neighborhood and community parkland inventory in the city of la porte resulting in the number of persons per neighborhood or community park acre in the city of la porte this result is then divided by the number of la porte persons per dwelling unit as identified in the latest united states census data giving the number of dwelling units per acre of neighborhood or community parkland this number is then divided into the total acquisition cost for land at the average appraisal value and development cost per acre for development of the land into a typical park as identified in the parks and open space master plan of the city this formula provides a baseline for determining the number of dwelling units per acre rate for future development within the city the parkland dedication or in lieu acquisition costs for parkland and the cost of future park development this formula shall be applied and reviewed periodically to assure that the process for future development remains fair and equitable as established herein in the event that the periodic review results in a determination of inequity an amendment to the ordinance to correct the inequity will be presented to council for consideration b general requirement for dedication of land and payment of park development fee 1 whenever a final plat is filed of record with the county clerk of harris county texas or a development site plan or a property survey is submitted and filed with the approving authority of the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other planning and development ordinances that may be contained within the

specifically excluded from the park development fee requirements of this chapter any proposed plat or site plan or property survey submitted to the city of la porte for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section the required land dedication of this section may be met by a payment in lieu of land where permitted by the city of la porte or required by other provisions in this chapter in the event a plat is not required and a development site plan or property survey is filed the dedication of land or payment in lieu of land required under this section shall be met prior to the issuance of a building permit by the approving authority of the city 2 the city council of the city of la porte declares that development of an area less than one acre for neighborhood park purposes is impractical therefore if fewer than 93 dwelling units are proposed by a plat filed for approval the approving authority may require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount as provided in subsection c below 3 in addition to the required dedication of land as set forth above there shall also be a park development fee paid to the city of la porte as a condition to subdivision plat approval or issuance of a building permit such park development fee shall be set from time to time by ordinance of the city council of the city of la porte sufficient to provide

documentation is provided water surface elevation means the height in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum ngvd of 1929 or other datum where specified of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas  42610 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in vtcs delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses  42610 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of la porte texas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  42610 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  42610 lands to which this article applies the article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard with the jurisdiction of city of la porte texas  42610 compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be located altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations  42610 interpretation in the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be  1 considered as minimum requirements  2 liberally construed in favor of the governing body  and 3 deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes  42610 basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the

this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  42610 abrogation and greater restrictions this article is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article and another ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail  42610 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations on rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or
