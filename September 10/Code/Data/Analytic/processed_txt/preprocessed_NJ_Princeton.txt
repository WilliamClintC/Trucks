buildings occupied in the discharge of official duties will address these harms and leave open ample alternative venues of political fundraising  and whereas our laws in new jersey do not presently recognize the misuse of public property for political fundraising as a distinct offense therefore it is accordingly found and determined that the municipalitys interests in an independent and efficient government  2212 borough adopting ordinance  2214 bao605 workforce and a government that is undermined by neither the fact nor appearance of improper influence of political contributions on

water charged to each such owner during the calendar year preceding the service year or if a winter quarter meter reading is available a sum equal to four times the amount of metered water charged to such owner during the winter quarter if the winter quarter is zero the amount charged would be the amount of metered water charged to each such owner during the calendar year preceding the service year in the event that it is contended by the engineer or by the owner or occupant of any house or building that the calculation of the service charge upon the basis of metered water does not fairly reflect the amount of the sewage discharge into the sanitary sewage system either because it discharges into the system from sources other than metered water or because of elimination from the system of metered water that is disposed of elsewhere the sewer service charge may be adjusted for good cause shown by filing first an administrative appeal to the  3428 borough adopting ordinance  3430

t10b1881 bao1040 division 9 residential clusters  t10b189 statement of purpose  the municipal council to implement the goals and objectives of the princeton master plan has determined that the residential cluster development technique should be allowed and encouraged in particular zoning districts as an alternative to conventional development in order a to allow for innovation in residential development to meet the demands of the citizens for a variety of housing types sizes designs and forms of ownership and affordable housing opportunities b to provide a flexible design method which can relate the type and layout of residential developments to the particular site constraints and to the particular demands for housing and related facilities c to protect environmentally sensitive lands such as stream corridors steep slopes and other critical site features and natural resources by requiring that the more fragile areas of the site remain in preserved open space d to allow the most developable areas of the site to be more intensely developed in return for retaining other portions of the site in common open space e to allow residential developments to be designed and constructed at a lower cost per dwelling unit for streets utilities and other site improvements f to reduce the amount of blasting and other subsurface disturbances required for street and utility installations g to provide for recreation facilities which are appropriate to the needs and convenient to the residents of the development h to allow for the installation of pedestrian and bicycle circulation networks to serve the residents of the development and which are integrated with the other community facilities i to provide a desirable visual environment development techniques and design arrangements related to the particular site j to provide substantive and administrative regulations which can control development pressures so that the flexibility and innovation allowed is

common open space approved by the planning board with the use of those walking paths being dedicated by easement to the municipality for the use of the general public  or 2 residential clusters designed with more than 50% common open space  or  t10b1911 borough adopting ordinance  t10b1912 bao1045 3 residential clusters designed with an active recreation area of at least onehalf acre dedicated and conveniently accessible to the public provided that the municipal council has agreed to accept said dedication this area may also be counted toward the developers obligation to provide onsite active recreation areas for the residents of the development  or 4 residential clusters which dedicate suitable land for affordable housing provided the municipal council has agreed to accept said dedication the dedicated land must have a sewer service or be in an area that permits sewer service  and b frontage on an existing road or proposed roadway which is part of a development  and c no more than 20% in steep slopes defined as slopes greater than 50% wetlands wetland buffers and wetland transition areas as shown on an approved letter of interpretation and flood hazard areas and riparian areas d all structures removed and be free of any environmental hazards the density bonus units shall be in addition to the number of units which may be constructed under the calculation in a the bonus units in a residential cluster shall be subject to the same requirements as apply to the units permitted under a the housing units to be constructed in the dedicated affordable housing site are not subject to the provisions of the residential cluster but shall be subject to the standards adopted by the municipal council c the number of bonus units shall be calculated as follows 1 for public access to the approved walking paths in the common open space the bonus shall be 5% but this bonus may be increased by an additional 5% if the linear feet of dedicated paths exceeds 1000 linear feet and is equal to the lesser of i 5000 linear feet or ii that number which is 1% of the area of the preserved open space the total bonus for this category shall not exceed 10% 2 for common open space in excess of 50% the bonus shall be 5% for each additional 10% of common open space but the total bonus for this category shall not exceed 10% 3 for a dedicated public active recreation area

are not currently wooded such landscaping shall consist of a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs so as to produce a screen at least eight feet in height within two growing seasons the

one acre of land dedicated to the municipality for affordable housing in excess of one acre the developer shall receive a 15% bonus for housing units in a conventional development this land dedication shall not relieve the developer from any other applicable affordable housing fee the total bonus for this category shall not exceed 30% if the developer exceeds the minimum requirements for a bonus in a category there shall be an additional bonus interpolated from the above numbers eg a 7% bonus for 64% common open space or 12% bonus for a 19 acre public service recreation area if the developer qualifies for a bonus in more than one category the bonuses shall be cumulative but shall not exceed 50% a fractional bonus for units of 05 or more shall be rounded up by way of example if the number of dwelling units authorized under a is 50 units and if the residential cluster is designed with 64% open space and if a one and ninetenths acre active recreation area is dedicated as a public active recreation area the bonus for these two categories will be 19% or 10 additional units in addition to the above if the residential cluster is designed with eight acres of preserved open space and with public access of 2790 lineal feet of walking paths then the bonus for this category will be 9% and the total bonus will be 28% or 14 additional units  t10b1912 borough adopting ordinance  t10b1913

federal communications commission fcc has issued personal wireless telecommunication licenses for personal telecommunication services and other wireless technologies  and whereas the fcc requires license holders to provide coverage to areas where personal wireless telecommunications licenses have been acquired and this may require that such facilities be constructed in specified locations and manners determined by engineering standards to achieve such coverage  and whereas the federal telecommunications act of 1996 fta preserves local zoning authority to reasonably regulate personal wireless telecommunication facilities pwtfs  but the fta mandates that localities may not unreasonably discriminate among fcc license holders and that localities cannot prohibit or adopt regulations which have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services and the fta gives the fcc sole jurisdiction over radio frequency emissions of pwtfs so long as pwtfs meet fcc standards  and whereas it is necessary to reasonably regulate pwtfs and associated personal wireless telecommunications equipment facilities pwtefs to minimize potential aesthetic impacts  and now therefore there is
