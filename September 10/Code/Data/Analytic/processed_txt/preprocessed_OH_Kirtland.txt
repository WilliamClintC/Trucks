drainageways with side walls having slopes of 12 to 25 percent  and all highly unstable slopes exceeding 25 percent  bforest cover consisting primarily of diverse lowland forests found within flood plains and forests of uncommon species found in the ravine areas of the city  and chistoric and cultural features significant to the heritage of the community and consisting of an historic and cultural district encompassing the original settlement area of the community and individual sites and places identified as significant to the historic and cultural heritage of the community o43 passed 761976  122206 preservation of natural features the natural features included in the environmental overlay districts are intended to remain undeveloped to the extent possible for the following reasons athe alluvial soils are floodprone and are subject to the requirements of of the building and housing bthe remaining soil areas are generally excessively steep are highly unstable and would be subject to erosion and mass movement if ground cover were to be removed and the soil exposed development should generally not be permitted in these areas clowland forests are generally found within flood plains and the high diversity of vegetation types provides a wide range of potential wildlife niches the forest canopy along the east branch of the chagrin river and its tributaries helps to maintain soil stability by preventing erosion protects surface and ground water resources and water quality and provides a habitat conducive to the diverse fish species population presently found this forest cover should be preserved and protected to the extent possible and any removal should be highly selective dthe ravine forests have characteristics of ecological associations common in locations farther to the north and thus provide local habitat for wildlife species uncommon to the kirtland area the ravine forests help to maintain soil stability and prevent soil erosion on the highly unstable steep slope areas and protect surface and ground water resources by helping to control runoff rates infiltration and siltation this forest cover should be preserved and protected to the

slowing the velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow  2assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks  3reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses  4reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses  5provide watercourse habitats with shade and food  6reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a diverse aquatic system  7provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation  and 8benefit kirtland economically by minimizing encroachment on watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams retention basins and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of watershed
