brazil does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b1the flood hazard areas of brazil are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages cit is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve those uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program dthe objectives of this subchapter are 1to protect human life and health  2to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in a manner so as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7to ensure that potential
