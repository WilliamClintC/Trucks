operation maintenance repair and to obtain necessary improvements for the departments facilities and areas placed under their supervision where the amount contemplated to be spent is $2500 or less the commission may expend such funds without the necessity of soliciting competitive bids or obtaining public bids prior to expenditure of those funds the commission if it desires may delegate this responsibility to the department head or retain that responsibility within the commission itself with respect to the expenditures of funds falling within this category it is still the responsibility of the commission or department head making such purchase or expending such funds to be reasonably assured that the purchase price to be paid is reasonable in relationship to the item to be purchased or the services to be secured 2 two thousand five hundred dollars to $5000 a whenever the amount proposed to be expended exceeds $2500 up to and including the sum of $5000 written competitive bids shall be obtained prior to expenditure of those funds written competitive bids does not mean that there has to be an advertisement placed in a newspaper soliciting bids the obtaining of written bids of various parties who would reasonably be expected to be interested in submitting such bids with respect to the proposed expenditures is sufficient to meet the competitive bid requirement it is recognized that oftentimes the services sought or the product proposed to be purchased is of a specialized nature so that the seeking of written competitive bids is an unnecessary or useless act in such event a written bid should be sought from that person or persons who can reasonably be expected to provide the specialized service or product sought b caution is urged in reducing or restricting the seeking of competitive bids under the theory that the items or service sought is specialized wherever possible written competitive bids are to be actively sought especially where the amount involved moves closer to the $5000 limit c the commission may retain this right within itself or delegate all or any portion thereof to its department head because the majority of purchases will probably fall within this category the commission if it decides to delegate this responsibility to the department head should set up internal guidelines for the department heads to operate under with respect to seeking written bids within this category 3 where any purchase or contract is contemplated to exceed the sum of $5000 formal public bids shall be solicited in this situation an  672 general provisions  672  advertisement should be placed in the townships official newspaper soliciting formal sealed bids for the proposed item to be purchased or services to be performed bids will be opened in public at the time and place established in the invitation to bid record of all bids will be maintained and a resume of the bids will be available on request 4 no contract or purchase shall be subdivided to avoid the requirements of this section 5 it is recognized that there may occur an emergency situation where to follow the foregoing bid procedure would either cause or increase the potentiality of damage to township properties or facilities or would cause or would increase the danger to township personnel or to the public at large or would in general cause or maintain a situation which would be injurious to the public health safety and general welfare under such situations the commission could bypass the bid procedure in order to secure services or such other items

requirements of this chapter but which were lawfully established prior to the date of adoption or amendment of this chapter such nonconformities are considered to be incompatible with the current or intended use of land buildings or structures in the district in which they are located this article is intended to meet the objectives stated below by establishing regulations that govern the completion restoration reconstruction extension andor substitution of nonconformities and specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities shall be permitted to continue b the objectives of this chapter are to eliminate or bring into compliance lots buildings structures and uses which legally existed at the date of adoption of this chapter but do not meet the current standards of this chapter this chapter also has special provisions to permit certain nonconforming situations considered to be less harmful to continue under certain conditions but to discourage their expansion enlargement or extension the standards of this article are intended to accomplish the following 1 terminate and remove any use building accessory structure or any combination thereof that was established after the effective date of this chapter and in violation of this chapter such uses buildings or accessory structures are classified as illegal nonconformities and shall not receive any of the rights privileges or protection conferred by this article for legal nonconforming situations 2 eliminate nonconforming uses which are more intense than the uses permitted within the zoning district and are considered to be incompatible with permitted uses or encourage their redevelopment into a more conforming use 3 permit legal nonconforming buildings structures or uses to remain until they are discontinued or removed but to discourage their survival 4 encourage a gradual upgrading to a more conforming status of site plans which were developed in compliance with the standards at the time of their construction but which do not meet the site standards of this chapter and its amendments 5 encourage the combination of contiguous nonconforming lots of record to create lots which conform to current standards to avoid 285181 general provisions 285181  285182 applicability to avoid undue hardship nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in plans construction
