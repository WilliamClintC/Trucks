for exercising judgment 1 the hpc shall consider only the exterior features of a landmark or structure and shall not consider any interior arrangements 2 the hpc shall be strict in its judgment of plans for those sites and structures determined by research deemed to be significant for historic archeological or architectural reasons 3 the hpc may not strictly judge plans for a site or structure of little historic archeological or architectural significance or plans involving new construction unless such plans would seriously impair the historic archeological or architectural significance of the surrounding site or structures 4 the hpc is not required to limit new construction alteration or repair to the architectural style of any one period e commission decision 1 if the hpc fails to act on a completed application within 45 days after the date when the completed application was filed the application shall be considered approved unless the applicant and the hpc agree to an extension of the 45day period 2 the applicant shall receive a written notification and findings of fact of the hpcs decision in the event of a denial of a permit reasons for such denial shall be included with the written notification 3 in reviewing applications and filing its decisions the hpc shall state in writing its findings of fact f applications for structures of unusual importance 1 if an application is submitted for reconstruction or alteration affecting a site or the exterior appearance of a structure or for the moving or demolition of a structure the preservation of which the hpc deems of unusual importance to the city or of unusual importance to the state or nation the hpc shall attempt with the owner of the structure to formulate an economically feasible plan for the preservation of the site or structure unless the hpc is satisfied that the proposed construction alteration or reconstruction of the 123 site or structure will not materially impair the historic archeological or architectural significance of the site or structure the commission shall reject the application filing a copy of its rejection with the department of public works or building inspector or other public bodies or parties as may be appropriate 2 the hpc shall have 90 days after the date on which the hpc concludes that an economically feasible plan cannot be formulated under this section to negotiate with the owner and other parties to find a means of preserving the site or structure 3 in the case of a site or structure deemed to be valuable for the historic archaeological or architectural significance the hpc may approve the proposed construction reconstruction or alteration moving or demolition if a the structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the city of cambridge  b retention of the site or structure would cause undue financial hardship to the owner  or c the retention of the structure would not be in the interest of a majority of persons in the community   certificates of approval modification or rejection a certificate of appropriateness to be filed the hpc shall file with the building inspector zoning official or other public boards and commissions as may be required and necessary a certificate of appropriateness certifying its approval approval with conditions modification or written notice of rejection of all applications and plans submitted to it for review work shall not be commenced on any such project until such a certificate of approval has been filed by the hpc if such project requires site plan or other approval as provided for under this a certificate of appropriateness does not relieve an applicant from obtaining such plan approval from other boards or commissions or zoning official as may be required prior to issuance of a building permit public boards or commissions zoning or building officials shall not act to approve or modify a project for which the hpc has filed a certificate of approval or of

person aggrieved by a decision of the historic preservation commission has the right of appeal in accordance with  f   demolition by neglect a in the event of a case of demolition by neglect the hpc may request the zoning official to notify in writing the property owners of record any persons having a right title or interest therein and the occupants or other persons responsible for the maintenance of the property of the deterioration the notice shall specify the minimum items of repair or maintenance necessary to correct or prevent further deterioration b prior to the issuance of a written notice the hpc may request the zoning official to establish a record of demolition by neglect such a record may include dated materials such as photographs andor written reports to correct or prevent further deterioration c the notice shall provide that corrective action shall commence within 30 days of the receipt of said notice and be completed within a reasonable time thereafter the notice shall state that the owners of record of the property or any persons of record with any right title or interest therein may within ten days after the receipt of the said notice request a hearing on the necessity of the items and conditions contained in said notice in the event a public hearing is requested it shall be held by the hpc upon 30 days written notice being mailed to all persons of record with any right title or interest in the property and to all citizens and organizations which the hpc determines may have an interest in the proceedings d if after the public hearing the hpc determines that the corrective actions remain necessary the hpc may request the zoning official to issue a final notice to be mailed to the owners of record and all parties of record with any right title or interest in the subject property advising them of the items of repair and maintenance necessary to correct or prevent further deterioration the owners shall institute corrective action to comply with the final notice within 30 days of receipt of the revised notice e upon failure neglect or refusal of the property owners or other responsible persons duly notified to take the corrective actions specified in the final notice within the time allotted the hpc may request that the zoning official institute any of the remedies and penalties provided by law for said violations the above procedures do not preclude the zoning official from pursuing other remedies independent of the hpc as may be required to remedy a zoning violation in the historic area overlay district 125   violations any persons who violates the provisions of this section by willfully performing or allowing to be performed any work without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness failing to

future displacement and suffering of its residents this protection is achieved review of all activities proposed within identified flood plains and by the issuance of permits for those activities that comply with the objectives of this chapter b floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced c
