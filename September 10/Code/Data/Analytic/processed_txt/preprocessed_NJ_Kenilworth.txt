as described in njac a58e as follows 1 profile pits shall be excavated if possible to a minimum depth of 10 feet below the existing ground surface or to solid bedrock where encountered if the profile pit becomes unstable due to lack of soil cohesion or the presence of groundwater or both the pit may be terminated at a depth less than 10 feet and soil evaluation below the depth of the pit may be carried out by means of three or more soil borings performed as prescribed in njac 58f the depth of the soil evaluation shall never be less than two feet below the proposed lowest subsurface floor

inclusive water levels may be measured directly within soil profile pits or borings whenever the borough determines that there has been a significant departure from normal climatic conditions the borough may with due notice to the administrative authority lengthen or shorten the period allowed for direct measurement during any given year in lowlying coastal areas where groundwater levels fluctuate with the tides measurements shall be taken at the time of highest groundwater elevation in response to tidal fluctuation  or b during other times of the year the depth to the shwt may be obtained from the soil conservation service county soil survey report provided that the soil series present at the site is identified based upon comparison of soil profile morphology observed within a soil profile pit and the soil profile description provided for the soil series in question within the county soil survey report in cases where the shwt is shown as a range of elevations in the county soil survey report the highest elevation of the range shall be used as the seasonal high water table the highest elevation determined by this method shall be decreased by a factor of 15 for example a shwt depth of six feet shall be reduced to four feet 3 when the determination of the shwt must be made in disturbed ground recognized as prescribed in njac a510 direct observation during the months of

appropriately scaled and legible to motorists amended at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art ii d fencing 1 fencing should be an integral part of the gateway scene for all the primary

materials that are similar to fencing used in the region but unique enough to establish an unquestionable identity e brick pavers brick masonry and paving is an element that is often visually associated with the downtown historic buildings and the borough core incorporation of brick pavers in the design for the primary gateways will reinforce their connection to downtown and help orient the traveler f decorative planting landscape provides an opportunity to reinforce kenilworths support of attractive features and the beauty of the borough a feature that should be enforced and encouraged throughout the borough variations of the planting scheme will ultimately extend throughout the borough plant material color and forms should be used to reinforce the unique character of each gateway each gateway should be somewhat structured and formal plant material proposed for the primary gateways should be selected to reflect seasonal change ornamental shrubs annuals and perennials should be introduced to emphasize entry introduce the character of the corridor and reinforce kenilworths appreciation of the beauty of the landscape g public art gateways are the front door to the borough and are prime locations for public art because of the visual exposure they provide public art helps to define gateways and the character of the borough by providing an image that
