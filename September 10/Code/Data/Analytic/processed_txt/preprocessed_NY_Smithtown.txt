board of the town of smithtown that a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the town g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  1531 general provisions  1533   1533 statutory authority in accordance with  10 of the municipal home rule law of the state of new york the town

the authority to regulate their roads and rightsofway to protect the public therefore the purpose of this article is to require utilities that use town roads and rightsofway to promptly remove their plants cables lines equipment and terminals from old and damaged poles and to further require the prompt removal of double poles once all plants cables lines terminals and other fixtures have been

smithtown has grown into a mature suburban town there is relatively little vacant land left for new residential subdivision development much of this land has remained undeveloped until now because of certain sitespecific obstacles to construction eg steep slopes or lowlying wetlands however the increasing demand for new housing coupled with favorable market conditions has made these remaining properties more attractive for development b the town planning board recognizes that these properties should be developed according to sound planning engineering and environmental principles more specifically they should be developed with the following goals in mind 76editors note see ch 322 zoning  24830 general provisions  24831   to preserve open space and subsequently to provide opportunities for passive or active recreational uses  to design environmentally compatible layout and construction so as to prevent the destruction of or minimize the adverse impacts to significant natural resources such as natural landforms steep slopes groundwater floodplains tidal and freshwater wetlands ponds streams prime agricultural soils vegetation wildlife scenic corridors and vistas clean air and solar or wind energy sources  to reduce the longterm municipal maintenance costs that must be borne by the town  to preserve and enhance the character of established neighborhoods  to prevent or minimize adverse impacts to or the destruction of significant cultural resources such as historic sites and structures and archaeological sites c the preservation and protection of these and other natural and cultural resources will benefit the general health safety and welfare of the present and future residents of the town clustering of residential development is a proven means of protecting natural and cultural resources when the physical nature of the land or its location within the community is such that a standard subdivision does not attain these goals or would be inappropriate whether for environmental or safety reasons then a cluster design shall be required d in addition to these benefits good cluster design helps reduce street construction and maintenance costs reduce vehicular trip miles conserve fuel and other energy and minimize school tax burdens good cluster design can also help preserve the established character of an area enhance social interaction within the community strengthen community identity and finally provide the variety of living environments necessary to meet the needs and desires of the town 2 criteria for review and
