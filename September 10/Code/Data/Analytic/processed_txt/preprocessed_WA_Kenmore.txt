all modes at one time safety is a primary concern for the city and the target zero resolution guides the pursuit of increased safety for pedestrians and cyclists which can require the separation of some uses on certain roads a citywide network as described in the comprehensive plan transportation element which accommodates users of all modes of transportation including airseaplane and freight and users of all abilities on appropriate networks of roads paths and trails balances the principles of complete streets with the realities of promoting a transportation system that is fiscally economically and environmentally sustainable within existing and future constraints using a toolbox of diverse techniques the city will plan for design construct operate and maintain a transportation network that meets these goals recently developed projects and those in future years will incorporate traditional and modern tools such as traditional modern sidewalks shared use paths paved shoulders bike lanes buffered and sharrows street trees and planting strips narrow vehicle lanes curbs with ramps transit priority lanes crosswalks enhanced pavement markings and symbols pedestrian signals countdown and lead pedestrian signals signage bulbouts and refuge islands transit stops and facilities rectangular rapidflash beacon enhanced crosswalks speed bumps bike parking raised medians street furniture and temporary installations street lighting textured and colored pavements  focused led street lighting and pedestrianlevel lighting  traffic circles and roundabouts  chicanes the city will emphasize the layered network approach to complete streets in the review of private development plans transportation system improvements and the citys sixyear transportation improvement plan tip this approach shall include new construction reconstruction and rehabilitationoverlay projects except as noted in kmc  exceptions a contextsensitive approach to each project will consider neighborhood character underserved modal choices and school transportation routes including busing walking and vehicle circulation around schools in addition to safety and fiscal considerations projects must meet the requirements of the current system and the needs of the updated future network as described in the comprehensive plan specifically as it applies to nonmotorized modal choices consideration will be given to accommodation of future transportation technologies such as driverless cars and the impact these may have on other modes of travel in the layered network   design guidance the city public works department maintains design criteria standards and guidelines based upon recognized best practices in street design construction and operation these criteria standards and guidelines include but are not limited to the latest editions of the american association of state highway transportation offices aashto policies for vehicular and bicycle facilities national association of city transportation officials nacto urban bikeway and street design guides publications and recommended practices from the institute of transportation engineers ite the washington state department of transportation wsdot design manual and the manual on uniform traffic control devices mutcd public works department employees have taken and will continue to take advantage of local training opportunities to become more familiar with these standards and their associated updates the city has adopted road standards 2016 and a street planning toolkit transportation element figure 12 which include a number of complete streets principles to guide all public and private transportation projects in the city these documents emphasize consideration of multiple modes of travel especially pedestrian and bicyclists use of a number of the techniques described in kmc  policy the road standards include provisions for flexibility and the adoption of new techniques and tools with the approval of the city manager new techniques and future developments in design which enhance the safety of all transportation users may be incorporated into future versions of the road standards   exceptions exceptions to the policies of this chapter must be submitted to the public works director and approved by the city manager the circumstances under which the city manager may consider exceptions to a complete streets approach to enhancement of the layered network are as follows astreet projects may exclude those elements of the policies of this chapter that would require the accommodation of street uses prohibited by law grants or other agencies  bmaintenance activities such as mowing snowplowing sweeping spot repair joint or crack sealing surface treatments or pothole filling do not require that elements of the policies of this chapter be applied beyond the scope of that maintenance activity  cstreet construction reconstruction and maintenance projects may exclude elements of the policies of this chapter when the accommodation of a specific use or mode is expected to 1require more space than is physically available topographic or rightofway where acquisition of additional rightofway would significantly increase project costs or 2be located where both current and future demand is demonstrated as being absent including a lack of current or planned transit routes or 3significantly increase project costs and equivalent alternatives for those travel modes that are documented to exist within close proximity or 4be incompatible with the layered network comprehensive plan transportation element or 5be incompatible with neighborhood character or 6have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams wetlands ditches floodplains or historic structures or sites above and beyond the impacts of currently existing infrastructure   implementation the city recognizes that many other agencies have a direct or regional interest in the citys transportation network because transportation frequently crosses city borders ensuring compatibility for all modes with neighboring cities is crucial to an effective network the city fosters partnerships with local transit providers king and snohomish counties washington state department of transportation wsdot and northshore school district to implement complete streets principles in projects involving these entities wsdot owns a regionally significant facility passing city and shares in the citys dedication to complete streets and a layered network approach the city has developed and continues to update a sixyear tip based on the comprehensive plan the comprehensive plan identifies both pedestrian and bicycle priority networks in addition to vehicular transportation network improvements the tip and comprehensive plan shall guide the development of projects projects will be constructed with a combination of city funds and grant funding the city will stay informed of and will apply for grant funding programs especially those with a focus on complete streets and nonmotorized travel improvements funding agency partnerships such as those mentioned above are key to implementation of complete streets projects within the layered network lowcost projects which can be achieved within existing pavement widths using temporary installations signing and striping are continually identified and implemented by the city   performance measures the public works director andor designees shall report annually to the city council on projects that were completed in the last year that are planned for the coming year and that further the vision of this complete streets ordinance the report shall identify yearly progress in advancing the lineal feet of bicycle and

needs existing level of development of the adjoining land is intensive sr 522 is distinguished by existing or planned nonrestrictive medians restrictive medians may be used as operational conditions warrant to mitigate turning weaving and crossing conflicts minimum connection spacing standards should be applied if adjoining properties are redeveloped 2access control design standards the public street intersection spacing and driveway connection spacing distances specified are minimums greater distances may be required by the city engineer to provide desirable traffic operational and safety characteristics if greater distances are required the city engineer will document the reasons based on traffic engineering principles for such greater distances nonconforming permits may be issued allowing for less than minimum spacing where no other reasonable access exists a variance connection permit may be issued where it can be substantiated by a traffic analysis to the satisfaction of the city engineer that allowing less than the minimum spacing or more than the maximum number of connections would not adversely affect the desired function of sr 522 and would not adversely affect the safety maintenance or operation of sr 522 apublic street intersections sr 522 should generally be capable of achieving a posted speed limit of 40 to 45 mph in the city where higher volumes are present

minimum distance to another public or private access connection shall be 250 feet nonconforming connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage topography or location would otherwise preclude issuance of a conforming connection permit 3variance permits may be allowed if conditions warrant these conditions must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city engineer by a traffic analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer 3corner clearance corner clearances for connections shall meet or exceed the minimum connection spacing requirements a single connection may be placed closer to the intersection in accordance with the following criteria aif due to property size corner clearance standards cannot be met and where joint access connections meeting or exceeding the minimum corner clearance standards cannot be obtained or is determined by the city engineer to be not feasible because of conflicting land use or conflicting traffic volumes or operational characteristics then the following minimum corner clearance criteria may be used corner clearance at intersections with restrictive median position access allowed minimum feet approaching intersection right inright out 115 approaching intersection right in only 75 departing intersection right inright out 230 departing intersection right out only 100

the state of washington dthe city manager is authorized to enforce this chapter the ordinances and resolutions codified in it and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder pursuant to the enforcement and penalty provisions of kmc ethe program may provide services related to surface water and stormwater management including but not limited to basin planning facilities maintenance regulation financial administration public involvement drainage investigation and enforcement aquatic resource restoration surface and stormwater quality and environmental monitoring natural surface water drainage system planning intergovernmental relations and facility design and construction the program may contract for services with interested municipalities or special districts including but not limited to sewer and water districts school districts port districts or other governmental agencies att e  purpose it is the finding of the city that the surface water management program is necessary in order to promote public health safety and welfare by establishing and operating a comprehensive approach to surface water and stormwater problems which would reduce flooding erosion and sedimentation prevent and mitigate habitat loss enhance groundwater recharge and prevent water quality degradation this comprehensive approach includes the following elements basin planning land use regulation construction of facilities maintenance public education and provision of surface water and stormwater management services it is the finding of the city that the most costeffective and beneficial approach to surface water and stormwater management is actions and protection of the natural drainage system in approaching surface water and stormwater problems the surface water management program shall give priority to methods which provide protection or enhancement of the natural surface water drainage system over means which primarily involve construction of new drainage facilities or systems the purpose of the rates and charges established herein is to provide a method for payment of all or any part of the cost and expense of surface water and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such services these rates and charges are necessary in order to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing uncontrolled surface water and stormwater erosion and water pollution to preserve and utilize the many values of the citys natural drainage system including water quality open space fish and wildlife habitat recreation education urban separation and drainage facilities and to provide for the comprehensive management and administration of surface water and stormwater att e  applicability developed parcels within the city shall be billed each year for surface water and stormwater management services pursuant to rcw  att e  policy ait is the finding of the city that basins are shared with other municipalities and cities in order to achieve a comprehensive approach to surface water and stormwater management the city and municipalities within a specific basin should coordinate surface water and stormwater management services in addition the program may contract for services with interested municipalities bit is the finding of the city that many of the difficulties found in the management of surface water and stormwater problems are contributed to by the general lack of public knowledge about the relationship between human actions and surface water and stormwater management in order to achieve a comprehensive approach to surface water and stormwater management the city should provide general information to the public about land use and human activities which impact surface water and stormwater management cit is the finding of the city that developed parcels contribute to an increase in surface water and stormwater runoff this increase in surface water and stormwater runoff results in the need to establish rates and charges to finance the citys activities in surface water and stormwater management developed parcels shall be subject to the rates and charges of the surface water management program based on their surface water and stormwater percentage of impervious surface coverage on the parcel and the total acreage of the parcel dit is the finding of the city that undeveloped parcels do not contribute as much as developed parcels to an increase in surface water and stormwater runoff into the surface water and stormwater management system undeveloped properties shall be exempt from the rates and charges of the surface water management program eit is the finding of the city that maintained drainage facilities mitigate the increased runoff contribution of developed parcels by providing onsite drainage control parcels served by retentiondetention facilities which were required for development of the parcel pursuant to kmc and approved by the city or can be demonstrated as required in kmc  by the property owner to provide detentionretention of surface water and stormwater to the standards in kmc shall receive a discount as provided in the rates and charges of the surface water management program if the facility is maintained at the parcel owners expense to the standard established by the department fit is a finding of the city that open space properties provide a benefit to the surface water and stormwater management system by the retention of property in an undeveloped state open space properties shall receive a discount from the rates and charges to encourage the retention of property as open space git is a finding of the city that the majority of parcels are residential the administrative cost of calculating the service charge individually for each residential parcel and maintaining accurate information would be very high a flat charge for residential parcels is less costly to administer than calculating a separate charge for each parcel therefore residential parcels shall be charged a flat charge based upon an average amount of impervious surface allowed per maximum impervious percentages set forth in kmc hcity streets and state highway programs provide substantial annual programs for the construction and maintenance of drainage facilities and the streets systems and their associated drainage facilities serve as an integral part of the surface water and stormwater management system city and state streets will not be charged a service fee iit is the finding of the city that comprehensive management of surface water and stormwater runoff must include anticipation of future growth and development in the design and improvement of the surface water and stormwater management system service charge revenue needs shall be based upon the present and future requirements of the surface water and stormwater management system and these needs shall be considered when determining the rates and charges of the program jit is the finding of the city that basin plans are essential to establishing a comprehensive approach to a capital improvement program maintenance of facilities and regulation of new developments a plan should analyze the measures needed to control surface water and stormwater runoff which results from existing and anticipated development within the basin the measures investigated to control runoff should include land use regulation such as setback requirements or community plan revisions which revise land use densities as well as the use of drainage facilities a plan also should recommend the quantity and water quality runoff control measures required to further the purposes set forth in kmc  and community goals the institutional requirements and regulations including but not limited to land use management funding needs and incentives for preserving the natural surface water drainage system should be identified in the plan the proposed ordinances and regulations necessary to implement the plan shall be transmitted to the council simultaneously with the plan kit is the finding of the city that areas with development related surface water and stormwater problems require comprehensive management of surface water and stormwater the use of low impact development best management practices and principles represent the citys preferred and commonly used approach for site development lit is the finding of the city that additional surface water and stormwater runoff problems may be caused by new land use development if not properly mitigated both of natural systems and improvements the surface water design manual this title and kmc titles 15 18 and 19 have been adopted by the city to mitigate the impact of land use development further mitigation of these impacts is based on expertise which continues to evolve as new information on our natural systems is obtained and new techniques are discovered the surface water management program studies basin plans and other special studies will continuously provide valuable information on the existing problems and areas of the natural drainage system that need special protection the city is researching and developing methods to protect the natural drainage system buffering and setbacks to alleviate existing problems setback and buffering measures allow natural preservation of wetlands and stream corridors to occur alleviate erosion and water pollution and provide a safe environment for the small mammals and fish which inhabit critical areas based upon the findings in this subsection and as information and methods become available the city manager as appropriate shall draft and submit to the council regulations and development standards to allow protection of the surface water and stormwater management system including natural drainage systems mthe program will maintain longterm fiscal viability and fund solvency for all of its related funds all required capital and operating expenditures will be covered by service charges stormwater capital facilities charges and other revenues generated or garnered by the program the program will pay all current operating expenses from current revenues and will maintain an operating reserve to minimize service impacts due to revenue or expenditure variances from plan during a fiscal year this reserve will be calculated based on the historic variability of revenue and expenditures the program will adopt a strategic financial planning approach which recognizes the dynamic nature of the programs fiscal operating environment longterm projections will be updated in the programs adopted strategic plan onetime revenues will be dedicated to onetimeonly expenditures and will not be used to support ongoing requirements the programs approach to financial reporting and disclosure will be comprehensive open and accessible nthe program shall prepare an annual multiyear capital improvement program which encompasses all of the programs activities related to the acquisition construction replacement or renovation of capital facilities or equipment all proposed new facilities will be subject to a consistent and rigorous needs analysis the programs capital facilities will be planned and financed to ensure that the benefits of the facilities and the costs for them are balanced over time othe program will manage its debt if any to ensure continued high credit quality access to credit markets and financial flexibility all of the programs debt management activities will be conducted to maintain at least the current credit ratings assigned to the citys debt by the major credit rating agencies and to maintain an adequate debt service coverage ratio longterm debt will not be used to support operating expenses the program will develop and maintain a central system for all debtrelated records which will include all official statements bid documents ordinances indentures leases etc for all of the programs debt and will accurately account for all interested earnings in debtrelated funds these records will be designed to ensure that the program is in compliance with all debt covenants and with state and federal laws pit is the finding of the city that surface water groundwater and stormwater impact public properties rightsofway and privately owned properties within the city except as set forth in kmc  and  unless the city agrees to maintain and operate a drainage facility in accordance with this section a drainage facility shall be a private facility and the person or persons holding title to the property shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of the drainage facility the city may assume ownership maintenance andor operation of drainage facilities only if the following conditions have been met 1the drainage facility is located within a rightofway  or 2the drainage facility is not located within a rightofway  and aall necessary easements or dedications entitling the city to properly access operate and maintain the facility have been conveyed to the city  bthe facility is located on residential property or properties  cthe facility is required for reasons beyond the control of the residential property owner  dthe facility does not contain waters of the state  ethe facility is not required primarily as a result of impacts associated with groundwater  fthe facility is not required primarily as a result of runoff from neighboring private properties  and gbefore assuming maintenance of privately maintained drainage facilities the city will consider 1the cost of assuming maintenance and operations  2the public benefit of assuming maintenance and operations  or 3operation and maintenance of the drainage facility will contribute to protecting or improving the health safety and welfare of the community based upon review of the existence of or potential for aflooding  bdownstream erosion  cproperty damage due to improper function of the facility  dsafety hazard associated with the facility  edegradation of water quality or instream resources  or fdegradation to the general welfare of the community     att e  rate structure athe service charge revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part as determined by the city council of the cost of surface water and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for that purpose bthere is hereby imposed upon all developed properties in the city annual service charges as imposed by the city council by resolution att e  rate adjustments and appeals aany person billed for service charges may file a request for rate adjustment with the city within three years of the date from which the bill was sent however filing of such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge brequests for rate

discharges into city waters stormwater pollution prevention manual administration enforcement hazards criminal penalty civil penalties for water quality construction  intent penalty  purpose athe purpose of this chapter is to protect the citys surface and groundwater quality by providing minimum requirements for reducing and controlling the discharge of contaminants the city council recognizes that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or collective impact of many small discharges therefore this chapter prohibits the discharge of contaminants into surface water and stormwater and groundwater and outlines preventive measures to restrict contaminants from entering such waters these measures include the implementation of best management practices bmps by the residents of the city bthe city council finds this chapter is necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city and the integrity of the citys resources for the benefit of all by minimizing or eliminating water quality degradation  preserving and enhancing the suitability of waters for recreation fishing and other beneficial uses  and preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality and biotic integrity of the water the city council recognizes that implementation of this chapter is required under the clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq in meeting the intent of the clean water act the city council also recognizes the importance of maintaining economic viability while providing necessary environmental protection and believes this chapter helps achieve both goals att f  discharges into city waters ait is unlawful for any person to discharge any contaminants into surface water and stormwater or groundwater contaminants include but are not limited to the following 1trash or debris  2construction materials  3petroleum products including but not limited to oil gasoline grease fuel oil and heating oil  4antifreeze and other automotive products  5metals

state legislature has delegated the responsibility to each community to adopt floodplain management regulations consistent with the national flood insurance program designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry the state legislature also has established that floodplains and other areas subject to flooding perform important hydrologic functions and as such they must also be regulated as critical areas under the growth management act gma this article addresses both mandates as an integrated set of regulations the flood hazard areas of the city of kenmore which encompass the federal emergency management agency fema designated areas of special flood hazard are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of development in areas of flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated anchored or otherwise protected from flood damage contribute to flood losses and may cause damage in other areas the purpose of this article is to establish minimum standards for developments located within or adjacent to flood hazard areas including areas of special flood hazard the following statements describe the purpose of this article aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding  dminimize prolonged business

damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder exh 1  variances in flood hazard areas aconditions for variances 1generally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level provided subsections b1 11 of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures or the citys local landmarks upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance conditions except subsection a1 of this section and otherwise complies with kmc a and b 8any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation bif a variance to the standards in this article is proposed the decisionmaker shall consider in addition to the conditions itemized in subsection a of this section and the standard variance criteria itemized in kmc  1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the

susceptibility and critical aquifer recharge areas  designation of groundwater susceptibility and critical aquifer recharge areas groundwater recharge areas play an important role in groundwater quality and the general environmental health of the area in which they are located although no critical aquifer recharge areas are designated within the city limits at this time the city understands the importance of protecting its groundwater resources for example groundwater can be an important source of water in city streams and wetlands particularly during dry summer months which supports associated vegetation communities and aquatic habitat some communities rely on groundwater for irrigation or drinking water in the city areas susceptible to groundwater contamination have been designated using the city of kenmore groundwater susceptibility map which was developed based on the guidance document for the establishment of critical aquifer recharge area ordinances ecology 1998

percent of the total number of dwelling units being provided cnumber of affordable housing units required affordable housing units shall be provided for any development exceeding the base density of the underlying zone as follows 1tier 1 if the number of bonus units is less than or equal to 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units then for every three bonus units one dwelling unit shall be a moderateincome affordable housing unit and two bonus dwelling units may be bonus market rate dwelling units 2tier 2 if the number of bonus units is greater than 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units and if the overall project density is less than or equal to 120 dwelling units per acre then a combination of lowincome affordable housing units and moderateincome affordable housing units shall be provided as follows for every four bonus units allowed beyond that needed to achieve the 10 percent moderateincome affordable housing units one of the moderateincome affordable housing units shall be made into a lowincome affordable housing unit up to a maximum of 33 percent of the affordable housing units or 33 percent of the total dwelling units in the development 3tier 3 if the overall development density is greater than 120 dwelling units per acre a combination of very lowincome affordable housing units lowincome affordable housing units and moderateincome affordable housing units shall be provided as follows the required numbers of lowincome affordable housing units and moderateincome affordable housing units shall be equivalent to those that would be required under tier 2 assuming that the project were to be developed at a density of 120 dwelling units per acre an amount of very lowincome affordable housing shall be required so that the total combined amount of very lowincome lowincome and moderateincome affordable housing units is equal to 10 percent of the total number of dwelling units in the development 4affordable housing example example is a oneandonehalfacre property with a base density of 48 dwelling units duunit per acre without the tod district overlay the property could achieve up to 72 dwelling units tier 1 example proposed tod development would achieve 93 dwelling units on site for 62 duunit per acre this provides 21 bonus dwelling units above the 48 duunit per acre base density of the zone since the number of bonus units 21 is less than 30 percent of the total units 93 seven of the 21 bonus units must be affordable to moderateincome households meeting tier 1 affordability requirements tier 2 example proposed tod development would achieve 113 dwelling units on site for 75 duunit per acre this provides 41 bonus dwelling units above the 48 duunit per acre base density of the zone since the number of bonus units 41 is greater than 30 percent of the total units 113 11 of the 41 bonus units must be affordable meeting the 10 percent affordability cap nine of these are affordable to moderateincome households and two are affordable to lowincome households 33 of the bonus units used toward achieving 10 percent affordable units 113 plus eight of the bonus units applied toward making two of the affordable units lowincome affordable units 825 2 tier 3 example proposed tod development would achieve 210 dwelling units on site for 140 duunit per acre the first step is to determine how many affordable units would have been required assuming 120 duunit per acre using the tier 2 formula this calculation results in 13 moderateincome affordable housing units and five lowincome affordable housing units to achieve the requirement that 10 percent of the total units in the development be affordable three additional affordable housing units would be needed 2118 3 these three units would be required to be very lowincome affordable housing units in summary the development would provide 13 moderateincome affordable housing units five lowincome affordable housing units and three very lowincome affordable housing units exh a  exh 1    exh 1  community business zone juanita subarea afor properties choosing to develop at higher residential densities in the cb juanita subarea kmc affordable housing units
