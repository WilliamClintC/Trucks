this chapter is adopted by the village of kewaskum village board under the authority granted by   wis stats this chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory regulations previously enacted by village of kewaskum relating to stormwater management and construction site erosion control 01 4102 findings of fact the village board finds that construction site erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land disturbing and land development activities have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically soil erosion and stormwater runoff can a carry a significant amount of sediment nutrients bacteriaother pathogens organic matter toxins and other pollutants to local lakes streams and wetlands  b diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life  c clog drainage systems with sediment which in turn increases maintenance costs  d overwhelm existing drainage ways with increased flows causing bank and channel erosion and increasing downstream flooding and property damage  e reduce groundwater recharge which may diminish stream base flows andor lower water levels in local lakes ponds and wetlands  f contaminate drinking water supplies  and g generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other offsite damage to property or the environment 02 4102 purpose and intent 1 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to set forth requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize sedimentation water pollution flooding and related property and environmental damage caused by soil erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff during and after construction in order to diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the natural resources of washington county 2 intent this chapter is intended to regulate construction site erosion and stormwater management under the authority granted in   wis stats this chapter is not intended to limit activity or land divisions permitted under the applicable zoning and land division ordinances 3 regional stormwater management the village board recognizes that the preferred method of permanently managing stormwater runoff from land development activities is preparation and implementation of regional stormwater management plans by watershed areas which are designed to meet the requirements of this chapter

50 percent ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs modifications or additions such ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and external painting decorating and paneling  the replacement of doors windows and other nonstructural components  and the maintenance repair or replacement of existing sewage systems water supply systems or connections to public utilities c substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the board of zoning appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring uses d

destruction when a structure with a nonconforming use is damaged by fire explosion flood the public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current equalized assessed value it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this including the requirements of section 95117 for nonconforming uses and structures in the fw fc and uf regulatory areas figure no 1 is it 50 percent yet sample problem  lets assume that the owner of a nonconforming house wishes to add a room to the house if the house had an equalized assessed value of $6000000 the property owner would be able to make improvements valued at 50 percent of the present equalized assessed value of the house or $3000000 the improvement would have to be built to zoning standards any further additions or structural alterations could not be allowed unless the entire structure was changed to meet the requirements for a new structure additions and modifications which are permitted are based upon a time period over the life of the structure as shown above therefore if in the example above the property owner constructed a $3000000 addition no further additions could be allowed because the 50 percent improvement limit had been reached however lets assume that the addition was valued at $1200000 or 20 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure $6000000 five years later the property owner again comes in wishing to add an attached greenhouse in the meantime the present equalized assessed value of the house has increased from $6000000 to $8000000 the value of the greenhouse is $800000 or ten percent of the current equalized assessed value of the structure the property owner has now accumulated 20 percent plus ten percent or 30 percent of the allowable additions finally three years later when the equalized assessed value of the house is $10000000 the property owner again comes in wishing to modify his house to the extent of $2500000 $2500000 is 25 percent of $10000000 therefore the property owner could not make the modification since he had already accumulated 30 percent and an additional 25 percent would be greater than the 50 percent allowed however the property owner could make modifications equal to 20 percent of the current equalized assessed value of the home or $2000000 this example is further clarified in the following table note the base for calculation is not the original value of the home at the time the ordinance is enacted but is the equalized assessed value of the home at each time the home is modified year equalized assessed value of home value of modification percent of modification cumulative percentage 1977 $ 60000 $12000 20% 20% 1982 $ 80000 $ 8000 10% 30% 1985 $100000 $100000 $25000
