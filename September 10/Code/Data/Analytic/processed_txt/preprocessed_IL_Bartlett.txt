determined that the proliferation of sanitary landfills in the bartlett area will endanger the health welfare and safety of the residents of the village their children and grandchildren for many years to come e by eliminating aluminum and bimetal cans newspapers and glass bottles from the stream of garbage the capacity of existing landfills to serve the needs of the village for the disposal of nonrecyclable garbage will be increased and extended for several years f in the interim science may find new technological methods for the safe disposition of household garbage without threatening the pollution of our air and our water supplies g the village has called upon the private contractors who collect garbage from residences in the village to provide the village with a curbside recycling

purpose of the planned unit development is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design for land developments than is possible under conventional district zoning regulations the planned unit development also provides for more efficient use of the land and thus results in more economical land development preservation of natural site qualities better amenities more open space and a higher quality project are the normal results of the planned unit development process the following objectives may be obtained use of the planned unit development procedure a to permit a greater choice in types of environment available to the public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application of the other sections of this title b to promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better design and development with the inclusion of aesthetic amenities c to combine and coordinate architectural styles landscape design building forms and building relationships with a possible mixing of different uses in an innovative design d to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods provision of underground utilities and the preservation of natural vegetation topographic and geological features and environmentally appropriate features e to provide for the prevention andor control of soil erosion surface flooding and the preservation of subsurface water f to create a method for the preservation of common open space for the continuous use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development g to provide for more usable and suitably located recreational facilities schools and other public and private facilities h to promote the more efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of utilities circulation and other facilities i to encourage land use which promotes the public health safety comfort morals and welfare j to create a method for the permanent preservation of

utilities including those regulated by the illinois commerce commission shall be reviewed by the village engineer for compliance with the provisions and intent of this section d traffic impact analysis 1 overview of traffic impact analysis the following criteria shall be used to determine the traffic impact for a development and to identify the traffic impact mitigation measures which may be approved by the village as conditions or restrictions on the development for the purpose of lessening or avoiding traffic impact on the public street and highway system evaluation of the traffic impact of a development with respect to these criteria is dependent on the baseline traffic volume and the geometry of the public street and highway system in the study area as well as the site traffic generation of the development itself the extent of traffic impact and the resultant traffic impact mitigation will therefore vary by the particular development proposed at a particular location 2 guidelines for traffic impact analysis traffic impact analysis required for developments under this section shall be based on the traffic impact analysis report guidelines as adopted and set forth in subsection g of this section in the establishment of intersection level of service and in the review of traffic impact analysis as determined below the village shall consider the degree of highway capacity utilization by the development and the extent to which capacity is available for future traffic growth when future highway improvements as might be included on either the impact fee program network or programmed highway network as may be permitted under subsection e2f of this section are utilized for traffic impact analysis the analysis shall include a five 5 year estimate of traffic growth on streets and highways within the study area to reflect traffic generated by land use development outside the study area 3 traffic impact criteria the following criteria are established as the minimum threshold criteria for identification of traffic impact under this section a level of service for critical intersections for developments with site traffic generation greater than one hundred 100 peak hour vehicle trips inbound plus outbound in either of the am or pm peak hours and the saturday peak hour for certain developments the traffic impact on level of service shall be as determined below for critical intersections where 1 baseline level of service better than c the development causes one or more critical intersections to operate at worse than level of service c under baseline plus site traffic conditions as assigned to the existing and committed highway network  or 2 baseline level of service worse than c the development causes the level of service for one or more critical intersections to worsen by more than five percent 5% as measured by the average delay per vehicle or critical lane volume for signalized intersections by reserve capacity for unsignalized intersections under baseline traffic plus site traffic conditions as assigned to the existing and committed highway network b operational or safety considerations traffic impact mitigation shall be required of all developments regardless of site traffic volume which might reasonably be anticipated to create or worsen traffic safety or operational problems related to site access and traffic generation as based on but not limited to the following criteria 1 lack of adequate gaps for site traffic to enterexit the external highway vehicle stream 2 the proposed use involves a drivecarryout or other automobile service oriented operation where automobile stacking or queuing may affect highway operations 3 the development is anticipated to create or worsen safety or operational problems due to  traffic increases on residential streets within the village 4 the parking generation and on street or off street parking design characteristics of the development create or worsen conflicts between nonsite traffic and parked vehicles 5 internal site circulation and access design and related site access improvements deviate from applicable standards and policies for sight distance left turn lanes and other design features in determining the extent and specific nature of traffic impact related to the general safety and operational criteria listed above the standards and policies currently adopted by the american association of state highway and transportation officials the institute of transportation engineers or  sterling codifiers inc  589702 the illinois manual on uniform traffic control devices may apply where they are more restrictive than the standards of the appropriate highway agency e traffic impact mitigation 1 requirement for public hearing and review developments which create a traffic impact as determined by the criteria set forth in subsection d3 of this section and which are appealed shall require a public hearing before the plan commission or zoning board of appeals whichever has jurisdiction as provided for in subsections c4 of this section to review and consider traffic impact mitigation measures 2 traffic impact mitigation measures traffic impacts shall be lessened or reduced application of one or more of the traffic mitigation measures that follow a reduction in development density reductions in trip generation and resultant traffic impacts can be realized by lowering the density of development as measured by floor area ratio or gross residential density the village may take the following action to reduce traffic impact of the development as it relates to density 1 reduce the allowable floor area ratio or gross residential density for the development otherwise permitted in the existing or proposed zoning for the property 2 deny or modify a zoning variation or amendment that would increase the floor area ratio or gross residential density of the project b change to a less traffic intensive land use reductions in traffic generation and resultant traffic impact can be realized by restricting the permitted land uses for the property to those which have lower traffic generating characteristics the village may take the following actions to reduce the traffic impact of a development as it relates to intensity 1 deny or amend a request for a special or conditional use 2 deny or amend a requested zoning amendment or zoning variations to a higher and more traffic intensive zoning classification for the proposed development 3 limit or otherwise specify the permitted land uses that may be developed under the existing zoning classification for the proposed development based on the traffic generating character of those land uses c transportation management strategies traffic impact may be mitigated by reducing the number of auto trips or increasing the occupancy of automobile trips use of operating improvements such as flex hours carpooling or vanpooling programs transit related project or programs subject to the approval of the village provided that 1 the parameters and requirements of the operating program shall be specified in an agreement between the developer and the village recorded as a restrictive covenant running with the land binding all future owners providing for annual inspection and monitoring by the village and penalties for noncompliance and injunctive relief d development phasing a development may be approved in phases so that site traffic added by the development can be accommodated by site or system highway improvements included in the traffic impact analysis as mitigation measures subsequent phases of the development however shall each be required to comply with the provisions of this section e site related highway access improvements site related highway access improvements may be utilized to mitigate the traffic impact of a development subject to criterion listed below and with the approval of the village and the appropriate highway agency 1 site improvements construction of site related highway improvements which improve the level of service or safety of the public street and highway system impacted by the development provided that such improvements are approved by the appropriate highway agency f system improvements developments required to pay an impact fee under the road improvement impact fee law of the state of illinois shall receive credit for highway improvements contained on the impact fee highway network as traffic impact mitigation measures the village may however require that the development be staged or phased over a period of time that the timing of improvement completion bears a reasonable relationship to the timing phasing of traffic generation from the development construction or funding of system related highway improvements over and above those delineated in the impact fee program highway network may be used for traffic impact mitigation provided that each of the following criteria are met 1 the highway improvements are included on the programmed highway network and the timing of improvement completion bears a reasonable relationship to the timing of traffic generation from the development 2 system improvements over and above the programmed highway network may be approved for traffic impact mitigation provided that such improvements are consistent with the long range transportation plan for dupage county and are approved by the appropriate highway agency g other methods other methods proposed for traffic impact mitigation by the developer which have been documented and proven to be effective in mitigating the traffic impacts of development may be considered by the village f variations if the standards imposed by this section place undue hardship on a specific development proposal the applicant may apply to the village for a variation the zoning board of appeals shall review the applicants request for a variation and shall submit its recommendation to the village board of trustees 1 standards for considering variations no variation shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that a the traffic impact mitigation measures
