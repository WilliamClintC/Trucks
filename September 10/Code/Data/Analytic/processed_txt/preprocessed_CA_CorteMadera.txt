square parking fund for the development of parking spaces in the village square area to satisfy the parking requirements of new or expanded developments in the village square which cannot provide onsite parking this fee would only be required for proposed developments which cannot provide required offstreet parking and for which the planning commission finds to be in the public interest to allow the inlieu fee as an option for the required parking  1992   findings a village square is a unique area of the town because of the squares historical significance and because it provides opportunities to create a civic and cultural activities center for corte madera b some properties in the village square area that will be developed in the future do not lend themselves well to the provision of offstreet parking without violating the design objectives established for the square  for example providing offstreet parking on certain properties would contravene the adopted design guideline which reads continuous building facades along block fronts around the park ie parkfacing facades should be unbroken by driveway approaches c because of the uniqueness of the village square area and the need to encourage design around the square which will enhance pedestrian interest the town council desires to establish an alternative for onstreet parking by allowing those properties which cannot provide required onsite parking as determined by the planning commission to pay an inlieu fee for the development of parking elsewhere within the immediate vicinity d the relationship between the inlieu fee and the resulting parking facilities is explained by the fact that the inlieu fee is a way of satisfying a parking requirement which otherwise could not be satisfied thereby enabling development to occur which otherwise could not  1992   village square inlieu parking fee an inlieu parking fee is established that may be applied to projects immediately surrounding menke park in village square that need to provide onsite parking to meet the requirements of the towns zoning ordinance but cannot provide such parking onsite see figure  for the area where the inlieu parking fee may be applied participation in the parking fee is voluntary on the part of the property owner as an alternative to the onsite parking required by the towns zoning ordinance the amount of said fees shall be established by resolution of the town council and amended from time to time for the purpose of reflecting changes in construction costs and land values the costs will be directly related to the fair market value of land required for a parking space and the estimated costs of developing a parking space  1992   village square parking fund establishedlimited use of said fund there is created a village square parking fund into which all inlieu parking fees collected pursuant hereto shall be deposited the money in said fund and interest derived from the fund shall be segregated from other town funds and shall be expended solely for the land or construction costs associated with developing parking spaces in the village square area  1992   applicability specifically to village square this inlieu parking fee program applies only to those properties immediately surrounding menke park and can only be approved for a specific development if found by the planning commission that this alternative to onsite parking is necessary to achieve the objectives described by the village square design guidelines in the best interests of the village square area and promotes the objectives of the towns general plan this alternative to onsite parking is appropriate for village square and this chapter is intended to apply to village square only  1992 figure

housing fund purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish a feasible means by which developers of nonresidential development projects can assist in increasing the supply of affordable housing in close proximity to where new employees to their projects work the impact fees contained in this chapter have been calculated to have a rational relationship between the amount of housing needed as a result of developing various businesses and the amount of subsidy needed to make the development of affordable housing feasible this impact fee shall be deposited into an affordable housing fund and used by the town to create longterm protected affordable housing or cause others to create that housing  part 2001   findings a commercial and industrial developments in corte madera such as office retail research development industrial and warehouse uses hereinafter all referred to as nonresidential developments have been and continue to be a major factor in attracting new employees to the area some of these employees will seek to reside in the town these new employees and their families create a need for additional housing in the town b the availability of housing in corte madera is limited with an over all vacancy rate among all housing units of only 375 percent the availability of affordable housing is even more scarce with an october 2000 survey of major apartment buildings throughout town showing a vacancy rate of only 16 percentie only five apartments were vacant of the three hundred eight total number of apartments surveyed multiple household properties tend to offer the most affordable rental rates c corte madera currently has significantly more jobs than housing units in the town with five thousand eight hundred ten jobs and three thousand six hundred seventy housing units there are also more jobs in corte madera than the four thousand six hundred employed residents new nonresidential development that creates additional jobs will create the need for additional housing to accommodate the new workers d the association of bay area governments has determined that twentysix percent of the projected growth in jobs in corte madera over the next five years will have incomes less than eighty percent of the areas median income many of these new workers will require affordable housingthat is housing costs that do not total more than thirty percent of the household income lack of affordable housing for new employees in corte madera will force many new employees to commute considerable distances adding to the air pollution and traffic problems in the general area e sponsors of nonresidential developments that contribute to the shortage of affordable housing should be required to contribute to programs that increase the towns affordable housing stock corte madera has caused to be prepared a study that examines the connection between nonresidential development and housing needs the report concluded that a clear nexus can be established between the number of jobs generated by various work place types and the number of future employees filling those jobs needing below market rate housing f a study of nonresidential development and housing needs prepared for the town in november 2000 and reviewed by this town council when considering this chapter concluded that a clear nexus can be established between the development of commercial industrial and other job generating uses and the need for housing the workers at these new developments g that study examined the number of employees that can be expected to occupy a prototype building using ten different business types and associated densities of employees and developed a projected number of housing units needed to accommodate such businesses the model was based on a one hundred thousand square foot building and from that an appropriate cost per square foot of new nonresidential development was calculated the nonresidential development impact fees are as follows workplace type impact fee per square foot office $ 479 r + d lab 320 light industrial 279 warehouse 40 retail 838 commercial services 120 restaurant 439 health clubrecreation 200 training

2e 2g  11152016   findings to the extent that any of the provisions of this changes or modifications in the requirements contained in health and safety the corte madera town council does hereby find that such changes and modifications are reasonably necessary because of local conditions prevailing within the town of corte madera a description of said local conditions is hereinafter set forth climatic the weather patterns within the town of corte madera are considered to be moderately affected by the pacific ocean and the san francisco bay which extends the yearround growing season of vegetation the normal years rainfall is approximately 28 inches while the summer condition with its prevalent pacific high cell creates the morning and late afternoon fog normally associated with the san francisco bay while normal temperatures usually do not exceed 7580 degrees during the summer months little or no rain falls during the period between april and november this combination often creates hazardous fuel conditions in the town drying winds in the summer and fall months reduce fuel moisture and relative humidity to the minimum levels thereby creating ideal fire weather conditions the normal afternoon winds that precede the fog can move a fire quickly in the hillside and open space areas of the town because of climatic conditions the county of marin has experienced water rationing in recent years including a mandatory 35 percent reduction in 1989 water shortages can be expected in future years due to limited storage capacities in marin increased domestic consumption and weather patterns that reduce the already minimal annual rainfall while sound management of the water resources is possible actual demands on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted geologic the town of corte madera is geologically mixed with three classifications of rock igneous metamorphic and sedimentary the outstanding material is volcanic in origin with ridges of serpentine reaching in excess of 700 feet in elevation much of the town is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only the steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders and sometimes prevents the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel seismic activity within the town occurs yearly with little or no damage although a real potential does exist with the town situated between two active faults the san andreas and hayward faults landslides have also been experienced in the town in recent years while stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved heavy rainfalls have caused failures these slides can close roadways making accessibility to many locations in the town impossible until properly cleared topographic the town is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side speed limits of 25 miles per hour by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads do not allow quick responses to emergencies the highway 101 corridor goes directly town and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem vehicular access within the town is affected by steep hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines many streets are narrow and winding restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own the town has many deadend streets and on christmas tree hill there is one main access route in or out of the area deadend streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal in addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus the deadend streets also limit egress opportunities for residents many of the commercial buildings in corte madera were largely built long before present code requirements existed consequently many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety wood frame construction of older buildings especially those in mountainous areas creates an adverse exposure problem not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings actual physical heat conduction and flying embers fire history in the town has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air throughout the town there are areas in which there are no water mains constructed at all meadow valley has no water main supply other than domestic and there is minimal water supply along casa buena drive fronting the auto dealerships and the other major commercial establishments the buildings on christmas tree hill many of which were constructed 50 or more years ago are serviced by minimal water main sizes the lack of adequate water supply in this area along with winding streets creates a unique fire problem the generalized water shortage in marin county results in occasional inadequate water volume and pressure for firefighting purposes in certain areas of the town  11152016   appeals whenever the fire disapproves an

findings a findings the town council of the town of corte madera has determined and finds that the adoption of the 2006 edition of the international wildlandurban interface the above changes or modifications are needed and are reasonably necessary because of local climatic geologic and topographic conditions as described below b local conditions local conditions have an adverse effect on the prevention of 1 major loss fires 2 major earthquake damage and 3 the potential for life and property loss resulting from fires occurring within the town making necessary changes or modifications to the 2006 international wildlandurban interface order to provide a reasonable degree of property security and fire and life safety in this jurisdiction below are listed adverse local climatic geologic and topographic conditions 1 climatic a precipitation precipitation ranges from fifteen to fortytwo inches per year with an average of approximately twentyfive inches per year approximately ninety percent falls during the months of november ten percent from may b relative humidity humidity generally ranges from fifty percent during daytime to eightsix percent at night it drops to twenty percent during the summer months and occasionally drops lower c temperatures temperatures have been recorded as high as one hundred four degrees fahrenheit average summer highs are in the seventyeight degree to eightyfive degree range d winds prevailing winds are from the northwest however winds are experienced from virtually every direction at one time or another velocities are generally in the five to fifteen mph range gusting to twenty to thirty mph particularly during the summer months extreme winds up to fifty mph have been known to occur e summary these local climatic conditions accelerate the speed intensify the degree and increase the size of fire in the community wood shake and shingle roof types proliferate within the town times of little or no rainfall of low humidity and high temperatures create extremely hazardous conditions particularly as they relate to wood shake and shingle roof fires and conflagrations the winds experienced in this area can have a tremendous impact upon structure fires of buildings in close proximity to one another commonly found in corte madera during wood shake and shingle roof fires or exposure fires strong winds such as those regularly experienced by the town can carry sparks and burning brands to other structures in close proximity thus spreading the fire and causing conflagrations in building fires strong winds can literally force fires back into the building and can create a blowtorch effect in addition to preventing natural ventilation and crossventilation efforts these conditions make it difficult to stop a fire after it has begun increases the need to rapidly reach the fire before it spreads or intensifies and increases the risks of property damage personal injury and loss of life resulting from the fire 2 geologic a the fire environment of a community is primarily a combination of two factors the areas physical geologic characteristics and the historic pattern of urbansuburban development these two factors alone and combined create a mixture of environments which ultimately determines the areas fire protection needs b landslides have also been experienced in the town while stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved heavy rainfalls have caused failures these slides can close roadways making accessibility to many locations in the town impossible until properly cleared c the relatively young geological processes that have created the san francisco bay area are still active today the district sits between two active earthquake faults san andreas and the haywardcalaveras and numerous potentially active faults one hundred percent of the town is in the strong to violent seismic hazard zones d fire following an earthquake has the potential of causing greater loss of life and damage than the earthquake itself the majority of the towns industrial complexes are located in the highest seismic risk zones the highest seismic risk zone also contains the largest concentration of hazardous materials hazardous materials particularly toxic gases could pose the greatest threat to the largest number should a significant seismic event occur the towns resources would have to be prioritized to mitigate the greatest threat and may likely be unavailable for smaller singledwelling or structure fires the greater risk of earthquakes results in a higher likelihood of a fire which could lead to substantial damage or loss of life within the town 3 topographic a because of the differing topography of corte madera the characteristics of the fire environment changes from one location to the next therefore the town has not one but a number of fire environments each of which has its individual fire protection needs b the service area of the corte madera has a varied topography and vegetative cover a conglomeration of bay plains hills and ridges make up the terrain development has occurred on the flat lands in the central portion of the district development in the hillside areas on the west and south sides of town is predominantly limited to residential remodeling and additions c many of the buildings in corte madera were built long before present code requirements existed consequently many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety wood frame construction of older buildings especially those in mountainous areas creates an adverse exposure problem not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings actual physical heat conduction and flying embers fire history in the town has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air d much of the town is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only the steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders and sometimes prevents the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel e vehicular access within the town is affected by steep hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines many streets are narrow and winding restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own the town has many deadend streets and on christmas tree hill there is one main access route in or out of the area deadend streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal in addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus the deadend streets also limit egress opportunities for residents f the town is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side speed limits of twentyfive miles per hour by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads do not allow quick responses to emergencies the highway 101 corridor goes directly town and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem g there is much diversity in slope percentages christmas tree hill slopes run from nearly level to over seventy percent h corte maderas semiarid mediterraneantype climate produces vegetation similar to that of most of marin county with specific growth locale a result of topography and prevailing wind the south facing exposure is primarily rye grass highly flammable brush with occasional clumps of bay and oak trees in the more sheltered pockets the north facing slopes are heavily wooded from lower elevations to ridge with oak and bay trees and minor shrubs of the general chaparral class i historic development of the residential community extended into areas of heavier vegetation and has resulted in homes existing in close proximity to dense natural foliage often such dwellings are completely surrounded by highly combustible vegetation compounding the fire problem from a conflagration point of view of particular recent note is the increase in dead down fuel and litter accumulation directly associated with the dead oak syndrome which has heightened the risk of fire being caused and spreading in many areas of the town 4 summary the above local climatic geologic and topographic conditions serve to increase the magnitude exposure and access problems characteristic of fire hazards existing within the town of corte madera other special circumstances that may tend to increase and intensify the fire hazards facing the town are a the extent of damage that may be done to the water system serving properties in the area in times of fire there are areas within the town in which there are no water mains at all constructed meadow valley has no water main supply to serve properties in the area other than domestic and there is minimal water supply that can serve properties along casa buena drive an insufficient water supply will increase the risk of a fire not being able to be controlled and increasing in degree and in the number of properties being affected after it has begun  b the extent of isolation experienced by town residents in the event that a fire or other catastrophe beginning a fire causes the bridge andor freeway overpass to collapse  c the extent of roadway damage andor amount of debris blocking the roadways of the town in the event of a fire  d climatic conditions hot dry weather with high winds which increase the risk and spread of fire  e time of day will influence the amount of traffic on roadways which would present an obstacle to timely respond to a fire and could intensify the risk to life during normal business hours when traffic is busiest the town of corte madera covers approximately four square miles including a population estimated at nine thousand one hundred many town residents commute to work in other cities which increases the traffic within the town there are two fire stations and a total of twenty career and twenty volunteer fire department personnel the fire department handles diverse responsibilities including wildland urban freeway and paramedical f the availability of timely mutual aid or military assistance is an important factor in the ability to respond to fires the town depends heavily on mutual aid resources for even a singledwelling structure fire in a widespread disaster those resources would be unavailable g the close proximity of residences and large portion of dwellings with wood shingle roof coverings within wildlandurban interface fire areas could result in conflagrations that spread rapidly from residence to residence 5 conclusion local climatic geologic and topographic conditions impact fire prevention efforts and the frequency spread acceleration intensity and size of fire involving buildings in this community further they impact potential damage to all structures from earthquake and subsequent fire therefore it is found to be reasonably necessary that the 2006 edition of the international wildlandurban interface adopted as amended herein to mitigate the effects of the above conditions  part 2008   appeals whenever the fire chief disapproves an application or refuses to grant a permit applied for or when it is claimed that the provisions of the code

floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the town council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter shall be rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this section are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon appeals and applications for variances the town council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d the importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity of a waterfront location to the facility where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access for ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the town council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the town council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the marin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency 7 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 8 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 5 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 9 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b1 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the town council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter

cognizant that portions of the sewer service system within the district are very old with multiple hillside singlefamily homes being historically serviced by one private sewer lateral eg one private sewer lateral for two or more homes where no apparent deficiency exists with a shared sewer lateral the district shall allow the shared sewer lateral where repairs are necessary the owners of the residences served by the shared lateral shall jointly be responsible for the repairs where repairs andor replacement of such a shared lateral is necessary the district may require the construction of a new private sewer lateral for each residential singlefamily home or the construction of a new larger private sewer lateral to accommodate the residences that share the sewer lateral b the district encourages owners of shared sewer laterals to enter into a maintenance agreement between all of the owners sharing the private lateral to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to pay for required repairs andor replacement of the private sewer lateral in general terms a common method is to proportion the costs of the maintenance repair or replacement among the owners sharing the lateral for example owners upstream of the shared lateral section requiring rehabilitation would proportion their costs relative to the length of the shared lateral which serves their home divided by the length of the entire shared lateral from the sewer main upstream to the point of the repair the relative percentage may vary along the pipe depending on the number of connections upstream of the repair

dist no 2  part 2002   reserved editors note  1 adopted  repealed   which pertained to inspection and correction of inflow and infiltration in lateral sewers and derived from san dist no 2  part 2002 infiltration and inflow  inspections  repairs findings a for the reasons stated below the district finds and determines infiltration and inflow hereinafter referred to as i & i into the sewer system to be a concern for the district that requires inspections and repairs required in this title during heavy rains a significant amount of storm water is introduced into the districts sanitary system as a result of i & i from breaches in the entire pipeline system which includes private sewer laterals that lead to the pump stations and central marin sanitation agency hereinafter referred to as cmsa treatment plant to a great extent much of this i & i is introduced into the districts pipelines and sewer mains from the private sewer laterals or unpermitted drainage structures leading from a property to the districts sewer mains as a result of i & i the cmsa sewer treatment facilities have the potential to become overburdened during periods of heavy rains leading to sewage overflows or bypass and possible spills into the san francisco bay waters such overflows and spills can lead not only to significant fines and penalties against the cmsa treatment plant and district by regional state and federal water regulatory agencies but may pose a significant risk to the environment and the health and safety of the public at large the district has determined that it is in the public interest to address i & i and sewer overflows contributed by private sewer lateral s and as such it is a district priority to authorize and mandate the enforcement of the upgrade replacement or repair of private sewer laterals as required in this title including as a condition of building permits construction work and property sales b the district also finds that inflow and infiltration from the lateral sewers of property owners has caused the district sewer system to back up leak malfunction and operate at a lower efficiency and capacity than the system is intended and designed to do further the district finds that these problems have resulted in the district paying considerable extra expense annually in order to continue the operations of its sewage pump stations the district also finds that this inflow and infiltration into the district sewer system is caused by the age and wear and tear to sewer laterals that have existed for many years without being tested replaced andor repaired the district hereby establishes in this section a voluntary sewer lateral replacement program to address the problems associated with inflow and infiltration in lateral sewers throughout the district c during each fiscal year and until the need shall no longer arise the district board or staff may in its sole and unfettered discretion offer to owners served by the district sewer system the option of executing an agreement with the district to test for inflow and infiltration and repair or replace the owners lateral sewer cost and expense of the district in exchange for the owners agreement to retain ownership and maintenance responsibility over the private sewer lateral after the district completes the repair or replacement of the lateral sewer the agreement shall release hold harmless and indemnification provisions in favor of the district and shall be in a form provided by district staff d the district shall not be required by this section to offer any owner being served by the district the opportunity to participate in the program described in this section the district board or staff shall determine which properties if any are to be offered participation in this program based upon the availability of district resources the needs of the property owners and any other factors that it may deem relevant to its decision notwithstanding any other provision in this title no person shall have the right to appeal any decision or determination made by the district under this section e the district shall test the lateral sewer for inflow and infiltration according to the standard specifications and drawings sanitary district no 2 of marin county or similar guidelines that may be established by or for the district f nothing in this section shall alter or modify the
