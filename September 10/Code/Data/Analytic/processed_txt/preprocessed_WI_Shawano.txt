notethis determination in the report standards for review this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with thepurposes intended by the common council as noted in this chapter and the comprehensive planthe intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individualproperty owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposedmodified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceedas follows articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation isrequired rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicitdiscussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoningregulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and thegeneral public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiablepotential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured withoutcareful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood thatthere may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitlyarticulated articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in designand prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is acritical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of designfreedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or notpreviously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increasedbeyond the degree specified in the chapter design freedom is to be encouraged while alowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rightsof the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if aninterpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the oneexpressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protectionto any affected party ie the abutting landowners the public at large andor a futureproperty owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made anyinterpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to thebenefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation whichwould either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the  city of shawano wi ecode360  462594 d 1 2 3 4 5 e 6 a b 7 regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapterany interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyondthat already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the powerto impose additional restrictions or requirements this chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximumachievement of public goals and the protection of abutting property owners while providingflexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goalsand objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights ofcompeting groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of useoptions persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for thelegislative acts of the common council in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by 5d abovethe following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land useinterpretation matters no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previouslyconsidered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment tothe zoning the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from arequested interpretation no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special useor a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in thezoning district of
