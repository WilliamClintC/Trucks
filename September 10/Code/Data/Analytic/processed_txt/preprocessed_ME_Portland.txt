adopted on  implemented a new eastern waterfront port zone for the maine state pier and city of portland land use ordinances rev91806 portland ocean terminal the proposed changes for the portland ocean terminal and the maine state pier would allow for a wider range of uses for the piers and properties of the portland ocean terminal  purpose the eastern waterfront port zone is created to nurture deepwater dependent activity within the context of the established waterfront the transport of goods and passengers by water is an important component of both the local and regional economies and this transport and other forms of marine industry are dependent upon land and piers with direct access to portland harbor given the existing pier infrastructure proximity to deep water and urban context portlands eastern waterfront is uniquely situated to support a wide range of waterdependent industry and commerce variety of marine activities the support and expansion of portlands marine industry requires piers uplands and circulation consistent with the transportation purpose and use of marine facilities the growth of portlands marine passenger industry also requires supporting services and activities to provide a safe convenient and enjoyable travel experience for users of marine passenger facilities nonmarine uses that complement the marine passenger industry are compatible with existing and future waterdependent uses and provide opportunities for residents and visitors alike to enjoy the eastern waterfront throughout the year are encouraged the primary use of the deepwater resources must be for the berthing and support of large vessels nonmarine uses that complement and support the deepwater infrastructure and do not conflict or compete for limited space with existing or anticipated deepwaterdependent uses are encouraged existing and future pier infrastructure and upland support areas should be designed and maintained to support a variety of marine uses and be responsive to future technologies and trends in the marine industry given the need to nurture and support deepwaterdependent uses and the need for nondeepwater dependent uses to complement the marine passenger industry and to support the maintenance and repair of pier infrastructure the eastern waterfront port zone recognizes the following hierarchy of uses city of portland land use ordinances rev91806 a the first priority of this zone is to protect and nurture existing and potential deepwater dependent uses those uses requiring a minimum of 15 feet of water depth  b the second priority is to allow shallow waterdependent and other permitted marine uses so long as they do not interfere with deepwater dependent uses either directly by displacement or indirectly by placing incompatible demands on the zones infrastructure  and c other uses specified herein are allowed only if they do not interfere with and are not incompatible with higher priority uses 06 91806  no adverse impact on marine uses no use shall be permitted approved or established in this zone if it will have an impermissible adverse impact on future marine development opportunities a proposed nonwater dependent component of a development will have an impermissible adverse impact if it will result in any one 1 or more of the following a the proposed use will displace an existing waterdependent use  b the proposed use will reduce existing commercial vessel berthing space  c the proposed use structure or activities including but not limited to access circulation parking dumpsters exterior storage or loading facilities and other structures will unreasonably interfere with the activities and operation of existing waterdependent uses or significantly impede access to vessel berthing or other access to the water by waterdependent uses  or d the siting of a proposed use will substantially reduce or inhibit existing public access to marine or tidal waters 06 91806

or simple polygon that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display but not any supporting framework bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence is clearly incidental to the display itself b computation of area of multifaced signs the sign area for a sign with more than one 1 face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible city of portland land use ordinances rev4994 14578 from any one 1 point when two 2 identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than fortytwo 42 inches apart the sign shall be computed by the measurement of one 1 of the faces c computation of area of awning signs 1 for opaque awnings only those sections which incorporate writing symbols emblems or other types of graphics used for the purposes of identification or advertisement shall be included in computing sign area the methods set forth in subsection 1 of this section shall be utilized in measuring sign area on opaque awnings street names and numbers on opaque awnings shall not be considered to be signs for purposes of this section unless a business located within the building has the

for the purpose of locating the sign in cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined sign height shall be computed based upon the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot whichever is lower e computation of number of signs for purposes of computing the number of signs a single sign shall be considered either enclosed within a single frame or composed of modular parts with

the petitioner and his property would cause undue hardship the words undue hardship as used in this subsection mean a that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted  b that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood  c that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality  and d that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner 2 disability variance notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c1

difficulty variance a notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 14473c1 and 2 of this section the board of appeals may grant a variance from the dimensional standards of this article when strict

purpose purpose whereas the city of portland is a homerule unit of government under the maine constitution and 30a mrs 3001 and as such may exercise any power and perform any function in order to protect health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city  and whereas promoting the welfare of the citys citizens its most important asset and those who work within the citys borders is an endeavor that plainly meets this criterion  and whereas after years of inaction by the united states congress it is time for municipalities and states to lift families out of poverty and stimulate the economy by raising the minimum wage  and whereas mayor michael brennan created a working group which included community labor and business leaders and tasked them with reviewing the minimum wage issue within the city of portland  and whereas the cost of living in portland has increased making life here cost as a percentage of income as much as is paid by residents of chicago illinois sacramento california and other major united states cities where the minimum wage is much higher  and city of portland minimum wage ordinances rev 112016 2 whereas an estimated 20000 workers in the state of maine work for minimum wage and a substantial number of them are among the city of portlands more than 65000 wage and salary earners  and whereas the massachusetts institute of technology has calculated that for a single adult to support him or herself in portland at the current minimum wage he or she would need to work over 50 hours a week  and whereas more than 50 percent of portland public school students are eligible for free lunch meaning their families have incomes at between 100 percent and 185 percent of the federal poverty level which is higher than what a single parent with one child in school would earn with a fulltime minimum wage job  and whereas rising housing costs including an increase in the median home price from $125200 in 2000 to $238400 in 201 are pushing low wage workers out of the city  and whereas the fair market rent in the portland area for a twobedroom apartment is $1012 and a fulltime worker job would have to earn at least $1946 per hour to afford that rent  whereas phasing in the wage increase over time will allow businesses to adjust and result in reasonable annual increases in expenses  whereas based on the work of the working group the materials and report of which are incorporated herein by reference and the aforementioned facts mayor brennan proposed that the minimum wage be increased within the city of portland  now therefore
