montpelier ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable

federal internal revenue department as evidenced by acceptance and approval of income tax returns filed therein  or buse the business allocation percentage formula set forth in h res 128 passed 9368  res 452 passed 71388 18305 business allocation percentage a1at the option of a corporate taxpayer or a nonresident business entity such taxpayers may but are not obliged to use the formula set forth in to compute the percentage of their entire net profits derived from activities both within and outside the municipality which is taxable under to determine the tax payable to the municipality thereunder 2if the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside the municipality during the period covered by any declaration or return required under its business allocation percentage is 100%  in other words the taxpayer is required to pay a tax at the rate in effect under the the entire net profit of the business 3if the taxpayer had a place or places of business outside the municipality and was doing business in the municipality during such period the business allocation percentage shall be computed on the basis as set forth in h 4the business allocation percentage is computed by determining the percentages which municipal real and tangible personal property bears to all real and tangible personal property including that situated in the municipality of taxpayer wheresoever situated  which the municipal business sales bear to taxpayers entire business sales wheresoever derived including those derived from the municipality  and which payrolls paid by taxpayer within the municipality bear to taxpayers entire payroll wheresoever paid including the municipal payrolls  adding together the three percentages so arrived at and dividing the total by three 5however if one of the factors property sales or payrolls is missing the other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by two and if two of the factors are missing the remaining percentage is the business allocation percentage aexample 1 corporation having places of business in montpelier detroit and cleveland montpelier real and tangible personal property $10000 all real and personal property montpelier detroit cleveland $100000 percentage 10% montpelier sales $15000 all sales $75000 percentage  20% montpelier payroll $6000 all payroll $20000 percentage 30% business allocation percentage  10% plus 20% plus 30%equals 20%                              3 bexample 2 same corporation owning no real or tangible personal property anywhere montpelier sales $15000 all sales $75000 percentage 20% montpelier payroll $6000 all payroll $20000 percentage 30% business allocation percentage 20% plus 30% equals 25%                           2 cexample 3 same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in montpelier valued at $10000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside of montpelier other factors same as in examples 1 and 2 above business allocation percentage 100% plus 20% plus 30% equals 50%                               3 6after determining such business allocation percentage the tax shall be determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of the taxpayer wherever derived thus arriving at the taxable net profit and computing at the rate in effect under the the resultant taxable net profit 7in case it shall appear to the finance director that any income or capital of the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected the finance director may adjust items of income expense deductions and capital and disregard assets in computing any allocation percentage  provided any income directly traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income so as equitable to determine the tax bexplanation of property factor the percentage of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property within the municipality is determined by dividing the net book value during the period covered by the report of such property within the municipality without deduction of any encumbrances by the average net book value similarly computed of all such property within and without the municipality only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in determining such percentage cexplanation of sales factor receipts from the following are allocable to the municipality 1work done and performed or services rendered in the municipality 2rentals from property situated in the municipality where the rental of such property is a usual or normal part of the taxpayers business activity 3for the purpose of determining business allocation percentage no account shall be given to receipts within or without the municipality of income derived from intangibles including stocks bonds royalties and the like the income of which is taxable under the statutes of the state 4compensation and other receipts for work done or services performed within the municipality are allocable to the municipality and taxable under all amounts so received credited or charged by taxpayer in payment for such work or services are so allocable irrespective of whether done or performed by employees or agents of taxpayer or by any other person it is immaterial where such amounts were payable or where they were received acommissions or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to the municipality if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed in the municipality if the taxpayers services for which commissions or fees were paid were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or employees attached to or working out of a municipal place of business of the taxpayer the taxpayers services will be deemed to have been performed in the municipality bwhere a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment for services within and without the municipality the amount attributable to services within the municipality is to be determined on the basis of the relative values of or amounts of time spent in the performance of such services within and without the municipality 5receipts from sale of capital assets property not held by the taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are not business receipts receipts from the sale of real property held by a taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are business receipts and are allocable to the municipality if the real property was situated in the municipality receipts from sale of intangibles included in business capital held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are business receipts and are allocable to the municipality if the sales were made in the municipality or regular place of business of the taxpayer in the municipality dpayroll factor 1the percentage of the taxpayers payroll allocable to the municipality is determined by dividing the wages salaries and other personal service compensation of the taxpayers employees within the municipality during the period covered by the report by the total amount of compensation of all taxpayers employees during such period 2wages salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer 3employees within the municipality usually include all employees regularly connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the municipality 4however where an employee performed services both within and without the municipality the amount treated as compensation for services performed within the municipality shall be deemed to be in the case of an employee whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured by him such as a salesperson on a commission basis the amount received by him for the business attributable to his efforts within the municipality  in the case of an employee whose compensation depends on other results achieved the proportion of the total compensation which the value of his services within the municipality bears to the value of all his services  and in the case of an employee compensated on a time basis the proportion of the total amount received by him which the working time employed in the municipality bears to the total working time eadjustment of business allocation percentage formula generally the business allocation percentage formula will result in a fair apportionment of the taxpayers net profits within and without the municipality however due to the peculiar circumstances of certain businesses the formula may work a hardship in some cases or result in a tax evasion in others thus not do justice to the taxpayer or the municipality accordingly in such cases the finance director may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and proper allocation in any case where the taxpayer had adopted the optional use of the business allocation percentage

the municipality to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the municipality that all users should collocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the municipality the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with this policy 2feasibility of

be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect dif a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility fails or refuses to permit a feasible collocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new facility the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the municipality and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new
