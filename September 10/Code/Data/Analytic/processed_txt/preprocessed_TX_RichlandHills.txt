bitescratch is the best prevention of infection but quarantine of the animal is the only way to know for sure if further steps are needed the virus spreads slowly from the injury muscle tissue to the nerves and eventually to the brain the current post exposure rabies vaccine has been 100 percent effective when given before the virus enters the nerve however after the virus is in the nerve it cannot be stopped and is 100 percent fatal this is why quarantine is so important and the reason that the rules of quarantine must be strictly followed the following rules must be strictly adhered to in order to limit any potential spread of the virus 1 the animal must be isolated from all persons except for the person feeding or otherwise caring for the animal the animal must be kept in a separate room garage or outside pen and no access is to be allowed to anyone other than the caregiver any people exposed to the animal will most likely be required to receive the post exposure shots

or the animal must be moved the animal shall be taken to the animal services center or a veterinarian 3 the quarantined animal shall not be allowed in the same room yard or pen with any other animal chain link fencing is not adequate separation between the quarantined animal and other animals in the yard or on adjacent property because chain link fencing allows nosetonose contact 4 the quarantined animal must not be allowed to escape taken for walks on a leash or released for a nature call 5 the quarantined animal must be checked by a veterinarian on the first and last day of the

signs of rabies it may be released to the owner prior to or upon the expiration of the quarantine period  provided the owner has paid all of the reasonable cost of such quarantine and any veterinarian bills however if the quarantined animal does show clinical signs of rabies the animal shall be humanely destroyed and its head or brain submitted to the nearest laboratory certified by the state

city shall be required to dedicate construct andor upgrade required facilities and infrastructure to a capacity that meets these minimum levels b for each category of public infrastructure a minimum standard of infrastructure and in some cases service level has been developed based upon historic studies and construction projects of the city and other cities these minimum standards take into consideration the soil conditions and topographic configuration of the city the use and impact analyses of the north central texas council of governments in developing standard specifications for

results in a reduction in accidents or a reduction in the severity of accidents at those locations g in addition to installing the photographic traffic signal enforcement system the city shall also install signs along each roadway that leads to the intersection at which such system is installed the signs must be at least 100 feet from the intersection or located according to the standards
