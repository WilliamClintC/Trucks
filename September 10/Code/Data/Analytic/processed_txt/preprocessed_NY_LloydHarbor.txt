intent it is the intent of this legislation to adopt a stormwater management and erosion and sediment control chapter that will satisfy the relevant part of the phase ii stormwater regulations adopted by new york state department of environmental conservation dec  1712 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the village and to address the findings of fact in this chapter this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the spdes general permit for stormwater discharges from ms4s permit no gp0202 or as amended or revised  b require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of spdes general permit for construction activities gp0201 or as amended or revised  c minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  d minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality  e minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any

it is hereby determined that  1714 definitions  word usage a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed

of trustees hereby finds that excessive uniformity or dissimilarity inappropriateness and poor quality of design and the improper placement or inadequate screening of structures within the village and along its shorelines adversely affects the environment and community by creating a visual or ecological detriment these visual and ecological detriments impair the beneficial use of real property in such areas impair the stability and value of both the improved and unimproved real property in such areas prevent the most appropriate development of such areas produce a degeneration of the property and aesthetic character of such areas and impair the proper relationship between the taxable value of real property in the community and the cost of municipal services provided therefor these detriments singly and in combinations result in a deterioration of conditions affecting the health safety morals and general welfare of the inhabitants of the community it is the purpose of this article to prevent these and other harmful effects by instituting a review procedure for all building permit applications to the village prior to their review by the building inspector pursuant to the state building code  20533 application process a every completed application for a building permit for the construction of any building within the village of lloyd harbor or for the reconstruction or alteration of any building including any additions thereto which would affect the exterior appearance of such building shall be referred by the building inspector to the site and building permit review board of the village for review such referral shall be made within 21 days of the date that the completed application is received by the building inspector provided that such application

of the board filed with the village clerk the site and building permit review board shall disapprove any permit where it finds that the proposed construction reconstruction or alteration would be so detrimental to the surrounding properties or the community as to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth in  20532 above by reason of 1 excessive similarity to any other structure or structures existing or for which a permit has been issued or to any other structure included in the same permit application or any structure located on a contiguous lot or structure located on lots on

and arrangement of either doors windows porticos or other openings or breaks in the facade facing the street including reverse arrangement  or other significant identical features such as but not limited to material roofline and height or other design elements a finding of excessive similarity shall state not only that such similarity exists but further that it is of such a nature as to be expected to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth in  20532 and that the finding is not based on personal preference as to taste or choice of architectural style 2 excessive dissimilarity or inappropriateness in relation to any other existing structure or structure for which a permit has been issued or to any other structure included in the same permit application or any

for swimming pools tennis courts and other structures as to the screening and placement of the same a landscaped strip 10 feet wide planted and maintained with the appropriate number and species of nondeciduous plants with an actual height of at least six feet above the natural grade when installed is the preferred screening method between the pool or court and the abutting property however the site and building permit review board may approve alternate conditions if 1 there is existing landscaping on the lot between the pool or court and the property lines equal in effectiveness height and density to the required evergreen screening 2 there is a preexisting sixfoothigh opaque fence or wall on the lot between the pool or court and the property lines which is totally owned and controlled by the lot owner and which is in conformity with applicable fence height regulations provided that the site and building permit review board further finds that the increased height of matured evergreen screening is not necessary to screen the pool or court from the view of the abutting property 3 the existing topography of the lot where the pool or court is to be located relative to the topography of the abutting property is such that the pool or court will not be within the view of the abutting property provided that the site and building permit review board further finds that it is reasonable to expect that this topographical relationship will not be adversely altered in order to facilitate future development of either property  20534 vehicles unregistered  unlicensed  20534

village board of trustees hereby finds that for ecological public enjoyment public navigation aesthetic visual and public health safety and welfare reasons the coastal areas of the village of lloyd harbor must be protected 2 as recreational boating has grown in popularity there has been a concomitant and increasing demand for dock and mooring facilities both public and private the village of lloyd harbor has not been exempt from this trend the village contains no commercial docking facilities  however the increase in residential development along its shoreline has led to an increase in the number of applications for the construction of private docks 3 the harbor of lloyd harbor and lloyd point are state of new york designated significant coastal fish and wildlife habitats all of the shoreline of lloyd harbor has also been designated a critical environmental area cea by the village of lloyd harbor in accordance with the new york state environmental quality review act seqra72 4 docks located in open water and any boats moored to such docks are exposed to increased damage from severe storms thus creating pressure to establish docks and piers in protected waters such as the harbor of lloyd harbor inlets are more protected from storms but are often tidal habitats for birds fish and other wildlife development in small harbor areas often impacts and degrades the very resources upon which this development depends the water quality in such harbors deteriorates the bird fish and other wildlife habitats are thereby adversely impacted and the wildlife is therefore threatened locating docks and boats in these areas can cause significant damage to habitats and wildlife 5 in addition to the other significant values of wildlife habitat areas habitat areas and waterfront areas in general have significant value for their scenic qualities a proliferation of docks and their associated boats causes overcrowding of waterfronts and waterbodies and can result in visual pollution depending upon the number location size height length and design of the docks 6 docks which are long enough to reach water of sufficient depth for large boats can be hazardous to navigation if they encroach upon a 72editors note see  80101 et seq of the environmental conservation law  205102 vehicles unregistered  unlicensed  205102   205103 creation  location  205104 coastal

presence long docks can also be an impediment to the enjoyment of recreational boaters and anglers who desire to navigate along the shoreline docks acting as barriers along the waters edge also keep pedestrians from enjoying the waterfront the desire for the construction of docks and other structures must be weighed against the environmental value and sensitivity of the waterfront and against the rights of the boating public to navigate the rights of the community and public to walk along the foreshore and the rights of the community and general public to be protected from visual pollution the board of trustees finds that private rights should not supersede those of the public and that an appropriate balance must be achieved between property owner desires to access the water and the protection of the public trust relating to the enjoyment of waters and foreshore in the village b it is for these reasons that the village of lloyd harbor hereby creates the coastal overlay district1 cod1 and coastal overlay district2 cod2 a there are hereby created two overlay zoning districts respectively known as the coastal overlay district1 cod1 and the coastal overlay district2 cod2 these overlay districts shall be in addition to the existing underlying zoning which they overlay and the regulations of these overlay districts shall supersede any inconsistent or less restrictive regulations of the existing underlying zoning b the respective locations of the cod1 and cod2 districts are as shown on the village zoning map the landward boundary of the cod1 and cod2 districts shall be 40 feet inland of the mean highwater line and seaward to the jurisdictional boundaries of the village a the cod1 district essentially encompasses relatively small or narrow waterbodies and lands immediately adjacent thereto because of the small or narrow configuration of these waterbodies construction of shoreline structures such as docks piers bulkheads revetments or other major shoreline construction in areas not previously disturbed by such development ie natural beach tidal flats adjacent woodlands or salt marsh may have a significant adverse impact upon the environment b for these reasons and those reasons specified in  205102 above there shall be no new structures or buildings or the enlargement or alteration of any existing structures or buildings as defined by this chapter located in the coastal overlay district1 except that  205102 lloyd harbor code  205104  1 private docks piers bulkheads revetments or other major shoreline construction may be located in the cod1 upon review and approval from the planning boardand the issuance of a building permit by the building inspector if the planning board determines that such structures will not provoke any of the adverse effects enumerated in  205102 and if the structure is a dock that the planning board further determines that the dock would meet all of the following conditions a in order to minimize visual impact the dock shall be of the floating variety only and shall only be permitted in those locations where the rising and lowering of such floating dock will not have a significant adverse impact upon vegetation wildlife or wildlife habitat including fish and fisheries resources b the dock shall be of a length size and height which has no significant adverse impact upon the environment from a visual perspective or otherwise  shall be of a length which does not impede the navigation of vessels  and shall be of a length which in no case exceeds 75 linear feet seaward from the mean highwater

unimproved lots a title this article will be known as the excavation erosion and sediment control law b purpose 1 excessive quantities of soil are eroding within areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as housing development roads and recreation areas in the village of lloyd harbor this soil erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies washed out fills roads and embankments the resulting sediment clogs storm sewers muddies and silts streams ponds and surrounding waterbodies sediment is expensive to remove and diminishes the use of water for its most beneficial purposes sediment filled waterways can result in damage to wildlife habitat and be a threat to the general health welfare and safety 2 the removal of protective topsoil sod earth and gravel
