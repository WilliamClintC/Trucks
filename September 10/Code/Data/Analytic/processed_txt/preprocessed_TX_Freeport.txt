caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive

division a3 are met 3a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that aan upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  bthe facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and main tenance procedures  and

must be provided within five days 1a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  2the period on non compliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated

noncompliance with the prohibitions in  a and b3 b7 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements cbypass 1for the purposes of this section abypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility bsevere property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused delays in production 2a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these

prohibited and the potw may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless 1bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or

minimizing juvenile delinquency in the city in the years ahead the community sense of the proper time for the cessation of all outdoor activities by minors on the streets in public places and in

associated with those of youthful years cthe city council finds that the city is not overcrowded local school facilities and adequate indoor living space permits minors in the city to healthfully occupy their time during daytime and nighttime hours commercial recreational facilities are almost nonexistent and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets and frequent the commercial establishments of the city which are open after the curfew hours which this subchapter declares dthe city council finds that minors roaming the streets public places and

that school hours should generally be used for educational activities by minors fparental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm legal sanctions to enforce such results have had a
