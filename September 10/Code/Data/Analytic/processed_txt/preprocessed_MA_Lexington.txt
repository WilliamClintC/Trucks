adjoining land for the future extension of the street and other public facilities 1 reserve strips prohibited where a way within the subdivision passes within 25 feet of an adjacent property the subdivision plan must reserve an easement providing access from the way to the adjacent property 2 reconstruction of street if development of adjoining land occurs later if the adjoining land is later developed the developer of that land may extend the street and utilities to the adjoining land such construction must include the removal of any turnaround any land within the rightofway that was part of the turnaround and is no longer needed for an extended rightofway must be landscaped and deeded to the abutters 3 utility stubs extended the board may require the developer to construct stubs of utility lines and other underground services and facilities to the edge of the rightofway so that future extension of the street and utilities can be made without digging trenches in the street a the board may require the developer to construct a wye stub of newly constructed utility lines to the edge of the rightofway of a street to serve lots that abut the street but are not in the subdivision so that those lots may connect to the town system later without digging trenches in the street b 4 c street classification 1 compliance with the classification system d 72 lexington code 72  the street type is defined by assessing the streets proposed role in the towns and regional transportation system together with its surrounding built and natural environment lexington is generally suburban in character with some parts appearing rural and some quite urban which makes identifying the unique or projectspecific contextual elements crucial to determining the appropriate design a for the purposes of an application the board will determine the classification of each proposed street b classes the street type reflects its degree of local access and regional connectivity as described below arterials arterials have a high to moderate degree of regional connectivity at a wide range of speeds with a low to high level of local access examples include waltham street and massachusetts avenue a collectors collectors have a low to moderate degree of regional connectivity at a wide range of speeds with a higher degree of local access than arterials grant street hill street and lincoln street are examples of collectors b local streets local streets have a low to no degree of regional connectivity low speeds and a high degree of local access c minor streets minor streets are a subset of local streets that serve directly or indirectly fewer than 10 existing proposed or potential dwelling units minor streets are typically but not always deadend streets d 2 street names street names must be different enough in sound and in spelling from other street names in lexington so as not to cause confusion a street that is planned as a continuation of an existing street must have the same name the extension of a street to connect to another street with a different name must have the name of the longer street the board after consultation with the towns public safety officials determines the name of the street 3 street name signs street signs must be erected on twoinch inside diameter posts at all street intersections per the standard specifications a temporary street name sign with black letters four inches long on light background must be erected at the time work is started in that part of a subdivision at all points where permanent signs will be required the developer must keep complete visibility of street name signs until they are replaced by permanent signs that follow the towns specifications at the developers expense 4 e design standards for streets and rightsofway 72 general provisions 72  design standards for streets and rightsofway these standards draw from and rest upon several important street design resources these standards are consistent with and in the case of silence or conflict should be referred to those described in the 2011 edition of a policy on geometric design of highways and streets by the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto   the massachusetts department of transportations specific guidance on complete streets design standards found in the following publications a project development and design guide 2006  healthy transportation policy directive p130001 2013  b c engineering directive e14006 2014  and separated bike lane planning and design guide 2015 d  the many related resources referenced in the above especially those aimed at achieving flexibility around pedestrian and bicycle facilities  a the standards below are not an attempt to provide every detail needed to design a

streets must make adequate provisions for cyclists for minor and local streets these accommodations are likely to be met by sharing the travel lane without the need for formal markings or signage on collectors and arterials however depending on the context adjustments to travel lane widths shoulder widths pavement markings dedicated bicycle lanes or separated lanes may be required 4 onstreet parking due to their width onstreet parking is prohibited on minor streets local streets by contrast can informally accommodate parking on one side of the street onstreet parking on collectors and arterials should be designed carefully in consideration of other travel lane users such as cyclists 5 changes in direction any change in direction of rightofway tangents must be connected by either a horizontal curve or an intersection 6 deadend streets a deadend street may not be longer than 650 feet from the point of beginning following the center line to the furthest point on the rightofway

authority the zoning bylaw requires every lot to have frontage on a street as defined in the zoning bylaw  135100 the bylaw has three classifications of streets 1 a public way laid out and maintained by a public authority  2 a way constructed in accordance with an approved subdivision plan  and 3 a way in existence on  that has been determined to be adequate by the planning board 1 this third classification of street is not a permanent one as it relies on the determination of the planning board as to the status of the street at the time a building permit is sought in order for a way in existence on  to be categorized as a street the planning board must make a determination that it has sufficient width suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land served by the way and for the installation of municipal services to serve the land and the buildings erected or to be erected on that land 2 this section of the zoning regulations sets forth the procedures and construction standards by which the board will render its opinion on the adequacy of these ways 3  objectives the planning board has adopted these regulations for the following reasons to extend the system of streets that are either accepted public ways or are constructed to town standards in a manner compatible with the towns
