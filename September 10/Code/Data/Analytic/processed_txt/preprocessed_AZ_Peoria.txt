ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of peoria to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 2298  2514 repealed and enacted supp 20144 floodplain management  appeal board a

applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated

and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges d upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this ordinance the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3 the land upon which the variance is granted shall be

of the one hundred 100 foot horizontal dimensions used to determine the slope as illustrated by figure 2 attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof the one hundred 100 foot slope determination lines shall be located perpendicular to the site or property contour bands those properties containing multiple slope planes should provide slope information for all such planes c to determine those locations where slopes of ten percent 10% fifteen percent 15% twenty percent 20% twentyfive percent 25% thirty percent 30% and thirtyfive percent 35% begin by the application of one hundred 100 foot straight lines that fall within each category the one hundred 100 foot slope determination lines shall be extended onto adjacent properties to a distance that establishes the overall slope of the land but in no case shall they be extended less than fifty 50 feet onto the adjacent properties d connect the midpoints of each series of one hundred 100 foot lines of the same slope category to establish the limits of that slope category e measure the areas resulting between each series of straight lines to determine the areas in each slope category f figure 2 attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof illustrates the method used in calculating the slope categories 2 computer generated slope determination method a utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at a maximum of two 2 foot intervals except as established herein areas known or shown to contain slopes of more than twenty percent 20% may utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at five 5 foot intervals b utilizing a slope generating software application slope categories shall be determined utilizing the slope categories established in of this computer generated slope analyses shall be prepared utilizing the following modeling parameters 1 maximum two 2 foot slope contour intervals for slopes less than twenty percent 20%  2 maximum five 5 foot slope contour intervals for slopes more than twenty percent 20%  3 the slope analysis shall utilize the above noted slope contour intervals modeling basis of grid evaluation to determine slope facets or contours  4 the analysis shall utilize a twentyfive 25 foot grid system d all data generated use of a computer generated slope determination shall be presented in both chart and graphical formats graphical slope information shall be presented in a clear and easily understandable format e the final map shall be plotted at a minimum scale of 1   200 and submitted to the department for review if found acceptable the final slope determination map shall be approved the department may reject the analysis and require corrections to the digitized slope category lines to more accurately reflect the

conservation overlay dlco is to identify and protect the unique and environmentally sensitive sonoran desert lands in the city and to promote the public health safety and welfare by providing appropriate and reasonable controls for the development of such lands specifically the lands are located north of pinnacle peak road the dlco is intended to a identify sensitive desert conservation features and resources b protect and preserve peorias distinctive desert landscapes and wildlife habitats for the enjoyment of current and future generations c protect people and property from hazardous conditions characteristic of environmentally sensitive lands and their development d integrate conservation design into the development of sensitive desert lands and employ development standards and guidelines that equitably balance conservation and development objectives in addition the dlco is intended to implement the goal policies and objectives of the desert lands conservation master plan dlcmp the overlay establishes a holistic approach to evaluating the environmental conditions of each site that allows both city staff and the development community a better basis for determining conservation areas the overlay also establishes criteria for determining conservation priorities based on the potential to expand or extend a regional open space corridor the opportunity to provide a link to an existing or future trail system the possibility of expanding an existing open space or the possibility of creating a buffer zone between different intensities of uses the dlco not only preserves sensitive and unique desert features but also native plants and plant communities in order to enhance the citys aesthetic appeal by conserving distinctive scenic character native plant communities are also preserved because they thrive in the local desert environment and provide soil stabilization to fragile desert soils stabilization that is lost after development activity that disturbs plants and top soil layers canopied plants such as mesquite provide nurturing shade and protection for lower level plants native plants identified for preservation are chosen on the basis of their slow growth habit the fact that the plant alone or in combination with others provides unique wildlife habitat and soil stabilization support its rarity in this environment and its proven success rate for salvage in this region finally the dlco establishes standards and design guidelines for development within desert areas and adjacent to conservation areas these regulations and guidelines vary by landform type in order to address the three distinctive types of geography desert floor bajada and hillside found in the peoria desert areas the classification system assumes a single vegetation type in peoria lower sonoran consisting of creosote bursage and saltbush associations the dlco is to be applied in conjunction with the 2003 international urbanwildland interface iuwic in cases where there is conflicting provisions the iuwic will take precedence    154 61317 applicability a the desert lands conservation overlay dlco establishes a special overlay zoning

talus slope a slope strewn with a layer of loose rock debris usually over unconsolidated soils 14 unstable slope a slope that exhibits one or more of the following conditions boulder collapse boulder rolling rock falls slope collapse and talus slopes 15 wash major washes that by their size are more riverine in character than washes they are characterized by extraordinary depth and width strewn rock and vegetative rubble diversity density and sizes of vegetation and volumes of water that they can accommodate major washes include morgan city wash big spring wash and twin buttes wash maximum flow capacity exceeds 500 cubic feet per second 16 wash primary wide sand bottom washes that carry drainage from a relatively broad watershed and are fed by a number of smaller tributary washes these washes generally have dense thickets of tree and shrub vegetation along their edges and are easily identified from aerial photographs maximum flow capacities are between 20 and 500 cubic feet per second 17 wash secondary tributaries to the significant washes and the rivers the majority of these washes are the finger washes which occur between slopes in the rugged areas they have narrow sand bottoms or are vshaped there is increased vegetation density along these washes but the vegetation is more in the large shrub category maximum flow capacities are up to 20 cubic feet per second 18 wildlife corridor pathways or habitat linkages that connect discrete areas of natural open space otherwise separated or fragmented by topography changes in vegetation and other natural factors in combination with urbanization and which 1 permit animals to move between remaining habitats allowing depleted populations to be replenished and promoting genetic exchange  2 provide escape routes from fire predators and human disturbances thus reducing the risk that catastrophic events such as fire or disease will result in population or species extinction  3 serve as travel paths for individual animals as they wander throughout their home ranges in search of food water mates and other needs or for dispersing juveniles in search of new home ranges 19 wildlife habitat locations where native

diversity the lower portions of alluvial fans dominated by palo verde and mixed cacti vegetation typify this area such as the bases of low mountain ranges saguaro is a visually dominant and important component of this area higher density and diversity of vegetation results in higher wildlife density and diversity that is dispersed between both wash and upland areas it is comprised primarily of bedrock materials with land slopes generally in the range of ten 10 to fifteen 15 percent drainage courses are typically well incised typical hazards include boulder rolling rock falls debris movement

grainy soil materials  desert floor landform type characterized in general by level plains and expanses that typically occupy the broad lowlands floodplains between desert mountain ranges the area is dominated by low growing shrubs such as creosote and bursage and supports larger shrubs and trees such as palo verde and ironwood and cacti such as saguaro because the uplands support a greater diversity and density of plants wildlife density and diversity are higher and important wildlife resources occur in both wash and upland areas the terrain is relatively flat with typical slopes of less than five 5 percent although the slope of this landform classification extends up to ten 10 percent soils are generally deep and alluvial the more numerous smaller washes that are found in more sloped areas are consolidated into fewer but larger washes because of the flatter terrain streambeds are typically sandy bottomed wide braided channels that carry high volumes of floodwaters  hillside

waters ii credit for generic pollutants such as biological oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease shall not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on

demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result g when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all of the following conditions 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must meet all of the following criteria i employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  ii currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with

water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to 1i of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the director i will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  ii upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and iii may retain the same equivalent mass limit in the subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the
