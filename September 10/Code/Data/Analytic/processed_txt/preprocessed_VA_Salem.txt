purveyor 10 determination or degree of hazard premises with one or more of the following conditions shall be rated at the corresponding degree of hazard a high hazard 1 the contaminant would be toxic poisonous noxious or unhealthy 2 a health hazard would exist 3 a high probability exists of a backflow occurrence either by back pressure or by back siphonage 4 the contaminant would disrupt the service of piped water for drinking or domestic use 5 examples sewage used water nonpotable water auxiliary water systems toxic or hazardous chemicals etc b moderate 1 the contaminant would only degrade the hazard quality of the water aesthetically or impair the usefulness of the water 2 a health hazard would not exist c low hazard 1 the contaminant would only degrade the quality of the water aesthetically 2 a health hazard would not exist 3 a low probability exists of the occurrence of backflow primarily by back siphonage 4 the contaminant would not disrupt service of piped water 5 examples food stuff nontoxic chemicals nonhazardous chemicals etc 11 containment policy a an approved backflow prevention device shall be installed at each service connection to a consumers water system where in the judgment of the water purveyor or the vdhoffice of water programs a health pollution or system hazard to the waterworks exists b when as a matter of practicality the backflow prevention device cannot be installed at the service connection the device may be located downstream of the service connection but prior to any unprotected takeoffs c a backflow prevention device shall be installed at each service connection to a consumers water system serving premises where the following conditions exist 1 premises on which any substance is handled in such a manner as to create an actual or potential hazard to a waterworks this shall include premises having sources or systems containing process fluids or waters originating from a waterworks which are no longer under the control of the water purveyor  2 premises having internal crossconnections that in the judgment of the water purveyor or the vdhoffice of water programs may not be easily correctable or have intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to determine whether or not crossconnections exist  3 premises where because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a complete crossconnection survey  4 premises having a repeated history of crossconnections being established or reestablished  5 premises having fire protection systems utilizing combinations of sprinklers fire loops storage tanks pumps antifreeze protection or auxiliary water sources including siamese connections fire loops and sprinkler systems with openings not subject to flooding and containing no antifreeze or other chemicals no separate fire protection storage or auxiliary sources will not normally require backflow prevention  and 6

of potential backflow backflow occurs either by back pressure or by back siphonage the degree of hazard either high moderate or low is based on the nature of the contaminant  the potential of the health hazard  the probability of the backflow occurrence  and the effect on waterworks structures equipment and appurtenances used in the storage collection purification treatment and distribution of pure water a air gaps give the highest degree of protection and shall be used whenever practical to do so in high hazard situations subject to back pressure b an air gap separation and a reduced

in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the wvwa upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection b of this section are met b criteria 1 either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis or the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2 credit for generic pollutants such as bod tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3 credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section 4 credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the wvwa may waive this requirement if they find that no environment degradation will result 5 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the director of the wvwa convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director the wvwa the director of the wvwa may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection 901955a15 a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water usage during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current

consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to

cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the wvwa was regularly in compliance with its vpdes permit and in the

portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial
