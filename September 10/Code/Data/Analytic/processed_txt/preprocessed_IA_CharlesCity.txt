purpose 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of iowa has in iowa delegated the responsibility to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of charles city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property and health  and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community b these losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by i the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood and ii the cumulative effect of flood plain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities c this upon engineering methodology consisting of a series of interrelated steps including 1 determination of flood magnitudes and the corresponding flood frequencies by statistical and engineering calculations which permits a consideration of such flood factors as expected frequency of occurrence area inundated and depth of inundation 2 calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capability of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey flood flows 3 computation and delineation of a floodway an area which must be reserved no obstructions for conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be substantially increased by future encroachment on the flood plain 201 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare by minimizing those flood losses described in with provisions designed to a reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially b restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities c require that uses vulnerable to floods including public utilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction d protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard e assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance national flood insurance program b general provisions 1 lands to which this apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of charles city shown on the flood boundary and flood map to be within the 100 year flood boundaries 2 establishment of official flood plain zoning map the flood boundary and floodway maps prepared as part of the flood insurance study for the city of charles city dated  are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the official flood plain zoning map the flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the flood insurance study and the flood insurance rate maps are also declared to be a part of this  rules for interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the zoning district shall be determined by scaling

in their interpretation and application the provisions of this be held to meet minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes 7 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages this not create liability on the part of
