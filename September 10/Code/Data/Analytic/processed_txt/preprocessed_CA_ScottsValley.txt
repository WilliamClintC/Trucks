provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by a prior code crossreference table which sets out the location of individual sections of the prior code and an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification a

moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this system the numbering system is the backbone of a code of ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section  each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1991 this note will be updated by municipal as each section is amended with the most recent amendment added to the beginning the notation part is used when the code section contains only part of the ordinance or section of the ordinance specified  this indicates that there are other areas of the code affected by the same ordinance or section of the ordinance if the code section was derived from an earlier codification the last entry in the note indicates the old or prior code section number statutory references the statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated by

ordinance is codified the chapter or chapters will be indicated example 204 612 904 if the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified when an ordinance is repealed the disposition will be changed by book publishing company to repealed by  with the appropriate ordinance number other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number

the reference and crossreferences where necessary look for the main heading of the subject you need then the appropriate subheadings business license  hg see also business tax fee  required when  the index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended insertion guide each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an insertion guide this guide will tell the code user the date

housing production requirements findings a city of scotts valley goals and general plan 1 the city council finds that a decent home and a suitable living environment for all is a priority of the highest order  this priority conforms with state and federal policies and in particular the goals policies and legal obligations of the agency reflected in the community redevelopment law health and safety et seq the goal of the city and the agency is to provide housing for persons of all economic levels with priority given to those persons of moderate low and verylowincome levels currently residing or working within the city 2 the city council finds there is an inadequate supply of housing in the city which is affordable to verylow low and moderateincome households federal and state housing finance and subsidy programs are not sufficient in themselves to meet that need in addition the adoption of the redevelopment plan by the agency now requires affordable housing units to be provided within the project area or provisions to be made for inlieu funding depending on the size of the residential development project as a percentage of the number of new units built within the project area 3 land for residential development in the city is limited and the amount of land which can be used for development of housing for verylow low and moderateincome households is being depleted by development of highcost housing in order to further the goals of the agency and the citys housing element of the general plan the city council finds that implementation of this process is necessary to reach agency goals of providing appropriate housing affordable to verylow low and moderateincome households 4 these findings and other sections of this chapter refer to and utilize certain terms which are defined in this chapter the sections in this chapter shall refer to those definitions in conjunction with the use of those terms b provide for workforce 1 the city council finds that housing for persons of verylow low and moderate income serves and enhances the public health safety and welfare and particularly finds that provision of verylow low and moderateincome housing is fundamental to maintenance of an adequate growing workforce and marketplace for the local economy 2 the city council acknowledges that if verylow low and moderateincome workers cannot find housing in the city then employers will have difficulty in securing a labor force and employees will be forced to commute employee commutes increase air pollution unnecessarily create traffic congestion and develop a population which is separate and distinct from fulltime residents establishing diverse and often contrasting demands on limited city resources c benefit to property participating the city council finds that a program established in the ordinance codified in this chapter will meet the needs of the redevelopment plan and will directly benefit the project area each new residential housing project which contributes to verylow low and moderateincome housing augments the housing mix increases the supply of housing for all economic segments of the community and thereby provides for a balanced community which is deemed to be in the public interest d smaller subdivisions the city council finds that a large portion of residential subdivisions are divisions of land into less than seven lots if developments of this size are exempted from contributing to the verylow low and moderateincome housing stock then the cumulative effect will result in a large diminution of the potential to obtain the resources necessary to provide affordable housing e resale restrictions the city council finds that the benefits of an effective verylow low and moderateincome housing program are severely diminished if the program benefits only the first occupants of verylow low and moderateincome housing who thereafter attempt to sell the assisted units at market prices therefore the city council recognizes that resale control to ensure the continuing availability of verylow low and moderateincome households is a necessary consideration in order to prevent undermining of the credibility of the whole program not so much because of the windfall to those who sell an affordable housing unit but because of the loss of the unit itself f public purpose the city council finds that public housing programs and housing subsidy programs can meet only a small portion of the need for verylow low and moderateincome housing the vast majority of housing units have been and will continue to be produced by the private housing industry this industry has the knowledge and ability to produce housing affordable to verylow low and moderateincome households given supportive government policies including incentives and public investment as appropriate therefore the city council finds it is a public purpose of the city to seek assistance and cooperation from the private sector and nonprofit agencies in making available an adequate supply of housing for persons of all economic segments of the community g economic feasibility the city council finds that the goal of increasing the supply of housing affordable to verylow low and moderateincome families assistance and cooperation of the private development industry can be reached only if the provision of such housing becomes more feasible for the private development industry the city council further finds that in order to make the provision of such housing more feasible to the private development industry it is necessary to provide flexibility in the manner and method of development which has a tendency to reduce the cost of development projects for the private development industry h benefits of benefits to the affordable housing developer may at the discretion of the agency include density bonuses waiver of fees application of planned development zoning authorization of assessment district and improvement district bonds and use of publiclygenerated funds to reduce development costs 2 benefits to the public include increased housing opportunities in all areas of the city an increased supply of verylow low and moderateincome housing an increased availability of funds for verylow low and moderateincome housing projects and an agency and city commitment to create low to moderateincome housing opportunities in the city i collection of fees 1 the fees required or permitted as an option by the ordinance codified in this chapter are appropriate and permissible the fees required or permitted as an option by the ordinance codified in this chapter will be effective in producing units because a the fee will be reflective of values or projects built in the project area the base for the inlieu schedule will be the median price of a home sold in each specific development constructed in the project area  b payment of inlieu fees will be within a specific period of time thereby allowing a predictable and stable flow of inlieu fees  and c the fees collected will be used in a specific time frame for the provision of affordable housing units 2 the change in requirements from a sixunitlot project to a sevenunitlot project is appropriate because a at a basic contribution rate of fifteen percent 15% an entire unit donation is not required until a project is of at least seven unitslots ie fifteen percent 15% contributionlot multiplied by seven lots equals a 105 unit contribution b in those cases where an onsite inlieu fee option is allowed for projects of seven or more unitslots the fee generated by a seven or more unitlot project will be sufficient to reflect the difference between a market rate unit in the city and the price of an affordable housing unit c the amount of the fee will be sufficient to induce developers to fully consider onsite contributions d the lesser contribution of projects of one unitslots at a basic fifteen 15% rate do not require contribution of one full unit e the graduated fees for projects of one unitslots is appropriate and proportionate to the scale of the projects j city commitment the city council finds that among the

of title of the affected parcel of land development impact mitigation fees legislative findings the city council of the city of scotts valley hereby finds and declares that all provisions set forth above are true and are hereby incorporated herein as findings  and said council does hereby further find and declare as follows a the state of california enactment of government has among other things determined the nexus that must be established in the enactment of development impact fees b the imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public facilities and service improvements necessary to accommodate such development this must be done in order to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare c this chapter recognizes that all new development within the city will result in additional growth and that such growth will place additional burdens on various city facilities infrastructure and services this chapter further recognizes the types of land development that will generate impacts necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them d all land uses within the city should bear a proportionate financial burden in the construction and improvement of public facilities and services necessary to serve them e the cost of providing public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects within the city exceeds the revenue generated by fees exacted from said development projects f the city hereby adopts the report from msi dated april 1990 entitled development impact fee report for the city of scotts valley which establishes the costs for providing public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects within the city g the development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs which are generated need for new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required incrementally by new development within the city h the fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city i the fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city which public facilities are consistent with the general plan and the housing element of the general plan of the city j the public facilities and anticipated future development herein referenced are based upon an analysis of existing land use and zoning k the fees established by this ordinance are consistent with the goals and objectives of the city general plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts caused by new development throughout the city development impact fees are necessary in order to finance the required public facilities and service improvements and to pay for new developments fair share of their construction costs l imposition of fees to finance public facilities and service improvements required by new development is necessary in order to avoid adversely impacting existing facilities and services m the city has pending before it subdivision maps and other applications for residential commercial and industrial development approval which the city must act upon further the city has heretofore approved various development projects in the form of tentative map or other approvals which have been expressly conditioned on payment of the fees established as a result of the development impact fee study undertaken by management services institute the results of said study constitute the report referenced above and said condition was assented to by the developers of these projects it is necessary for the provisions of this chapter to apply to these developments in order to protect the public health safety and welfare by the provision of adequate public facilities to afford developers certainty with regard to their financial obligations and to ensure that such development will not create a burden

proximate to one another the area surrounding the dwelling units is a common area that is managed and maintained by the individual owners of dwelling units in accordance with the rules of an associated agreement this mix of individual and common ownership is different from detached singlefamily residences and apartment house use  in singlefamily homes the dwelling is physically separate and the yard areas are under the more or less complete control of the owner  in conventional apartments there is an implied guarantee of continuous and effective management of the project the occupant is not the owner of the unit and does not have the financial commitment or problems of use maintenance or resale associated with ownership the unique nature of condominium projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may have deleterious effects upon the occupant seller and buyer who often do not appreciate the implications of condominium living and ownership  this may lead to conditions of mismanagement neglect and blight that affect the public health safety welfare and economic prosperity of the larger community to ensure that such problems are avoided in both the short and long term it is the express intent of the city to treat such projects differently from other multiplefamily dwelling developments of other structures which are not residential condominium projects it is found that the implementation of this section requires adoption of special requirements contained in this section for new condominium developments and the conversion of existing community apartment projects to residential condominiums b purpose the purpose of this section is to 1 establish requirements and procedures to be followed for the review and approval or disapproval of a new condominium project development and b the conversion of existing multiplefamily rental housing to residential condominiums  2 establish criteria for new condominium developments and condominium conversion projects by requiring conformance to the citys building code and other development standards set forth in this section  3 ensure that the developer
