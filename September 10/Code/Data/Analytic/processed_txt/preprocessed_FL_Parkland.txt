combine retail and service commercial office andor residential uses or structures on a single lot or as components of a single development the uses may be combined either vertically within the same structure or spread horizontally on the site in different areas and structures the primary design issue related to mixeduse projects is the need to successfully balance the requirements of residential uses such as the need for privacy and security with the needs of commercial uses for access visibility parking loading and possibly extended hours of operation the following standards are intended to address some of the unique issues associated with mixeduse developments a when residential uses are combined with commercial uses care shall be taken to ensure that adjacent uses will be compatible for example apartments above professional offices are a good fit while apartments above a fast food restaurant will create conflict b vertical integration of uses is preferred under those circumstances development of the ground floor level of a building should encourage pedestrian activity however a horizontal separation of uses eg commercial or office development along the front of a property and residential development to the rear may be appropriate or desirable depending on the size of the site access and surrounding property c when mixing uses in a horizontal or sidebyside fashion the backs of uses are often a good location to bring uses together and make a transition with alley access serving residential on one 1 side and commercial on the other d consider placement of commercial equipment and activity areas such as refrigeration equipment air handlers etc in terms of noise impact on residential uses e separate site access drives and parking facilities shall be provided for residential and nonresidential use f when residential and nonresidential uses are provided in the same structure separate entrances shall be provided for each use g site access drives should incorporate distinctive architectural elements and landscape features to differentiate access to commercial parking areas from residential areas h loading areas and refuse storage facilities should be located as far as possible from residential units and should be completely screened from view of adjacent residential portions of the project the location and design of trash enclosures should account for potential nuisances and odors i open space intended exclusively for residential use should not be accessible from commercial areas open space and courtyards in commercial areas should be accessible to residential occupants employees and visitors j public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence to people at all hours of the day and night k the architectural style and use of materials should be consistent throughout the entire mixeduse project differences in materials andor architectural details should only occur on a structure where the intent is to differentiate between the residential scale and character of the structure and the nonresidential scale and character exh a 9212015 determination of compliance the building official shall

capping may be used where 1 the soils to be covered will not suffer serious compaction  2 the covering materials are not chemically active  3 the site is one in which the natural processes of deterioration have been slowed  and 4 the site has been recorded e a buffer may be required between the development and the archeological site the width of the buffer shall be determined on a casebycase basis by the professional archeologist after consultation with representatives of the state of florida division of historical resources f the archeological site if preserved in situ shall

cease work within twenty 20 feet in all directions of the find and within five 5 working days shall notify by writing the department and representatives of the state of florida the developer shall engage a professional archeologist to have an archeological and historical survey prepared within ten 10 working days the archeologist shall determine after consultation with the state of florida division of historical resources whether or not the find is significant and if so the actual dimensions of the site a significant archeological find is one which 1 is associated with an event or person of recognized significance in florida or american history or recognized scientific importance in prehistory  2 can provide information which is both of demonstrable public interest and useful in addressing scientifically consequential and reasonable archeological research questions  3 has a special or particular quality such as oldest best example largest or last surviving example of its kind  4 possesses substantial stratigraphic integrity  or 5 involves important research questions that historical research has shown can be answered only with archeological methods i if the find is not determined to be significant the developer may resume construction without amendment to the development plan j if the find is determined to be significant the developer shall have the option of
