exemption for personal wireless service facilities federal law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services due to wide variation among

prohibit personal wireless services serves the public interest circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are extremely difficult to discern and specified findings to guide the analysis promotes clarity and the citys legitimate interest in wellplanned wireless facilities deployment therefore in the event that any applicant asserts that strict compliance with any provision in this chapter as applied to a specific proposed wireless communications facility would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services the director may grant a limited onetime exemption
