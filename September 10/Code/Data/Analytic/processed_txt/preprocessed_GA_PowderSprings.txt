the water quality act of 1987 33 usc  1251 et seq and the rules and regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency pursuant thereto emphasize the role of local governments in developing implementing conducting and funding stormwater programs that address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff c the city is required under federal and state regulations ie national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes phase i stormwater permit under which the city operates to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and stormwater conveyance system into state of georgia or united states waters d compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes phase i stormwater permit metropolitan north georgia water planning district and other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management drainage system maintenance flood control and other program activities e stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities contribute to the protection of surface water quality in area water bodies reduce the likelihood of infiltration and inflow of stormwaters into the sanitary sewer system to protect operations of such system and lessen erosion water damage to property and impairment of water bodies thereby assisting the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its npdes permit f a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city g the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs h stormwater management services and systems and facilities are needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point of time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community i the cost of providing stormwater management services and operating and maintaining stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system j the city has undertaken a comprehensive review by an oversight committee of city residents and businesses professional scientific consultants and staff to assess and define the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy k given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional review the city finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities and a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city l a schedule of stormwater utility service fees based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city such service fee may be complemented by other types of fees which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council m the area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided or to be provided by the city and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee n the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service fee on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes the stormwater service fee credit shall be determined based on technical requirements and standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit manual in its most current edition o it is imperative that the proceeds from the stormwater utility service fees together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds should therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund and remain in that fund except for disbursement for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes  6611 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context

of daytona beach florida 490 f3d 860 2007 including but not limited to the following a adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is no mechanism other than the regulations in this division to assign responsibility for the activities that occur on their premises to the owners of these establishments b certain employees of adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments c sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for

adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus hiv acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids genital herpes hepatitis b hepatitis nona hepatitis nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections g sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to address substantial governmental concerns h a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to ensure that adult entertainment establishments are operated in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein i requiring licensees of adult entertainment establishments to maintain information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of specific use provisions powder springs unified development certain types of criminal behaviors by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments j the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in violation of this division k under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not partial or total public nudity begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable secondary effects similarly establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment can have identical deleterious effects on the community l among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol live commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct prostitution public solicitation public indecency drug use and drug trafficking among the undesirable conditions identified in other communities when commercial live nudity occurs in combination with alcohol commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are the depression of property values and acceleration of blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection are also among these undesirable conditions the city council finds it reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable conditions will occur in the city as well m other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult bookstores adult novelty shops adult video stores peep shows adult theaters and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods n the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells videotapes depicting sexual activities o it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses neighborhoods places of worship schools child day care centers and public parks to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments therefore the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation the city council finds that the regulations in this division promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests including but not limited to reducing criminal activity and protecting against or specific use provisions powder springs unified development eliminating undesirable conditions and further finds and intends that such regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech and expression p nothing contained in this division shall be deemed to permit or condone any activity whatsoever which

general provisions findings a need for parking space for the parking of motor vehicles is needed to serve every property that contains a principal use for the safety and convenience of the people who live or work on the property shop or do business on the property or otherwise visit the property in the normal course of activity of the principal use b need for loading and unloading spaces space for the loading and unloading of equipment supplies and products is needed to serve properties engaging in such loading and unloading operations if not required adequate and proper loading spaces in acceptable locations tend not to be provided access parking and loading powder springs unified development c environment poor design of parking lots can lead to damage to the environment and may require the community to subsidize the interests of a private property owner at the expense of the communitys environment it is reasonable to good design of parking lots possible negative effects of parking and loading areas include changes to microclimate isolation of pedestrians increased stormwater runoff and reduced stormwater infiltration into the ground large parking lots can create heat islands where pavement absorbs solar radiation during the day and remains warm well into the night when heat islands exist cooling costs are higher than normal strategies can be used to reduce heat islands and their effects d stormwater management parking lots surfaces such as asphalt contribute to the degradation of local water quality parking lots can be more compatible environmentally if protection measures are incorporated into design standards and regulations porous pavement and grass pavers reduce runoff by allowing it to pass paved surface and infiltrate back into the soil and groundwater utilizing porous pavements and grass pavers also reduces or eliminates land dedicated to surface storm water management facilities porous pavement designs and grass pavers are appropriate in some instances other types of stormwater management facilities are environmentally compatible such as vegetative swales and bioretention e pedestrian mobility areas of paving are necessary to accommodate automobiles but they can be unfriendly to pedestrians without specific regulations requiring that designers accommodate pedestrians large open parking areas are conducive to high speeds and random maneuvers which can endanger pedestrians wide driveway aisles and access roads also increase speeds and discourage pedestrian travel street and parking lot design can balance the needs to accommodate automobilecentered standards with approaches that take into account the needs of pedestrians f overbuilding of parking lots offstreet parking requirements as conventionally implemented have resulted in excess unnecessary parking around shopping centers and malls because it remains unused for most of the year parking lot construction is a considerable factor in the cost of development reducing parking areas reduces development costs therefore reductions in the size of paved parking and flexibility in the types of pavement and parking designs are beneficial to all concerned g connectivity abutting properties which do not provide interconnecting access to one another make it difficult dangerous and inefficient if not impossible for motorists to travel between those properties between compatible uses provisions requiring interparcel access meet substantial public purposes of convenience and safety access parking and loading powder springs unified development purposes the multiple purposes of this article are summarized as follows a establish requirements for multimodal access to development sites including vehicular truck service and pedestrian as appropriate  b establish onsite circulation patterns conducive to safe pedestrian as well as vehicular and truck access  c establish minimum offstreet parking and loading areas in proportion to the need created by each use but considering reductions for the provision of alternative modes of travel  d reduce congestion in the streets and ensure that uses and functions of public rightsofways are not interrupted  e establish certain maximum as well as minimum requirements for parking spaces to reduce development costs and ensure that excess impervious surfaces are not constructed while providing for exceeding maximums when a demonstrated need exists parking requirements should be based on actual average parking demands rather than to accommodate the highest hourly parking at a site  f provide for alternative pavement materials such as porous asphalt turf block gravel and cobbles which have higher degrees of water quality effectiveness than conventional asphalt and pervious concrete  g promote flexible approaches to the provision of offstreet parking including in some cases as appropriate use of onstreet parking shared parking arrangements smaller spaces for compact cars and unimproved or pervious pavement overflow or spillover parking areas  h establish design and improvement specifications for the development of parking lots loading areas access aisles and connections of parking lots to public streets  and i promote and require interparcel access to facilitate movement of customers from business to business without generating additional turning

devices facilitate and aid in the identification and location of business establishments institutions and other land uses signs can be an effective easily available and costefficient way to inform people and aid their decisionmaking signs are an investment that brings economic value to businesses signs provide a means for attracting consumers who are not otherwise familiar with the geographic area signs provide assistance in individuals making selections from among alternative choices signs help certain locations work from a profitability standpoint that otherwise might fail without adequate signage b signs derive their value in part from public improvements businesses exist and prosper in part because consumers have access to their locations via public rightsofways businesses locate and signs are erected because of the facilitation of access the community provides to business locations the public way creates much of the value for the person or establishment erecting the sign and visibility from the public way is what creates the problems which give rise to the need for sign controls because the public way contributes to value the public therefore has a right and indeed an obligation to control the problems that arise from creating that opportunity and value regulation of messaging signage is a form of advertising all other advertising mediums are regulated there is limited federal and state regulation of signs despite significant intervention by the federal government in the regulation of other forms of communication signage is a type of advertising that cannot be turned off or rejected by the consumer like some other forms of communication for instance radio and television advertisements can be avoided by turning off the radio or television with regard to signs however motorists must keep eyes open to drive and cannot block out signs from their peripheral vision absent federal and significant state regulation it is in the public interest for the city to control signage signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development public safety a signs by their very nature are intended to gain the attention of motorists and therefore distract them from the primary purpose of maneuvering a vehicle along a road signs if unregulated can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs motorists might confuse signs that contain flashing or blinking red green or yellow lights with roadway traffic signals signs constructed of shapes like an octagonal stop sign might also impair public safety by confusing the motorist therefore there is a substantial public purpose served in prohibiting signs that mimic or would be confused with traffic safety signals and signs unregulated signs can also degrade the utility and reduce the visibility and effectiveness of public safety signs the regulation of signs is needed to ensure that signs can be read for their many beneficial purposes but in a way that does not impair visibility or cause traffic accidents b sign regulations achieve public safety purposes not achieved by building codes without regulations signs can pose a clear danger to public safety it has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents signs erected too close to a road can impair visibility and can cause traffic accidents if signs are not regulated with regard to placement height size and other physical attributes they can interfere with the sight of motorists exiting a driveway onto a public road it is necessary to regulate the time placement and manner of signs for public safety purposes c addressing of places and other means of locating establishments are essential to police fire and other emergency responders signage if left unregulated can cause confusion and delay in responding to emergencies d limitations placed on signs erected on storefront windows can increase visibility from outside the establishment and may help deter crime and robberies sign controls that limit the amount of storefront window and door areas that can be covered with signs enhance visibility of activities within the store or building limits on window signs can provide for an appropriate minimum visibility from the exterior and can increase public safety of commercial areas reduction in crime potential e electronic multiple message signs which allow operators to change content from remote locations in a matter of seconds have been shown to create possible threats to public safety such signs are erected for the purpose of trying to hold the attention of motorists by changing messages and pictures for short durations using a series of bright colorful images produced mainly via led light emitting diode technologies brightly lit and colorful signs that change messages every few seconds compel motorists to notice them and they lure the attention of motorists away from what is happening on the road and onto the sign such signs pose public safety threats because if they attract a motorists attention the motorist will look at the sign and not at the road electronic multiple message signs are also a threat to public safety because of their brightness making them visible from great distances due to their nature of brightness changing colors and changing displays electronic multiple message signs are more distracting than signs signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development which do not vary the brightness color or message or multiple message signs that are changed by other means at less frequent intervals some electronic multiple message signs could if unregulated have the appearance of large plasmascreen televisions an electronic led display contains brightlylit text and graphics which can be seen from hundreds of feet away drawing the attention of everyone within view unless otherwise regulated such displays can be extremely bright since they are designed to be visible in bright sunlight and at night furthermore the human eye is drawn to them far more strongly than to traditional illuminated signs it can take six seconds for a person to comprehend the message on an electronic sign which is considered three times the safe period for driver distraction public health unregulated signage can contribute to clutter and lack of organization in the wayfinding system of a community

have an impact on surrounding and nearby land uses and properties signs can have adverse impacts on adjacent properties if not regulated and properly maintained including the lowering of property

maintaining and enhancing the aesthetic environment regulations are needed to ensure that signs are compatible with the surroundings and do not detract from the character of particular districts the regulation of signage according to different zoning districts is therefore an acceptable way of ensuring character and attractiveness are maintained sign controls including regulations that go beyond size height location and manner restrictions are necessary to improve the visual character and quality of life of the community protection of public investments unregulated signs adversely impact public investments sign regulations help to assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures and spaces are protected unregulated signs can neutralize the value and benefit of public investments in streetscapes promotion and maintenance of private investments sign regulations benefit businesses that seek to advertise unregulated commercial signage can be detrimental to individual businesses because business owners may be compelled to erect larger and more costly signs to outperform neighboring or nearby businesses such competition for visibility among business can result in too many signs and excessive sizes to a point of diminishing returns where individual business signs are not adequately visible if unregulated the competition for visual recognition can defeat the purpose of the signs which is to carry a message often a commercial one if signs are left unregulated

supplemental findings intentions and explanations viewshed is subject to regulation this article is intended to apply to all signs and advertising devices that are or are intended to be viewed from a public rightofway or adjacent property or that are intended to be viewed from outdoor areas of public property except as otherwise specifically stated in this article content neutrality a the city intends to adopt regulations which are contentneutral it is not the intent to regulate the content of messages in any way to accomplish this these regulations do not distinguish between onsite or offsite sign content nor do they distinguish between commercial and noncommercial content it is the intent of this article to allow political religious or personal noncommercial messages on any sign permitted to be erected by this article signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development b for a sign code to be content neutral it is necessary to define all signs in terms of something other than the content of the message displayed on a given sign such as its location if in applying a sign regulation it is necessary to read the content of the sign to determine whether the sign is lawful or not the sign regulation has failed to achieve content neutrality c the principle of content neutrality runs counter to most peoples thought processes as they usually will have in mind a particular purpose when they want to erect a sign or ask for a sign permit for instance one person may wish to express a message unrelated to business or commerce noncommercial speech while business owners are trying to attract customers identify their products and perhaps assist other businesses or landowners in identification and location a sign code must provide for commercial and noncommercial speech even though it is considered wise not to distinguish between the two in the regulations themselves since to make that distinction one would have to read the message to determine whether it is commercial or noncommercial speech it is widely recognized that how sign regulations treat noncommercial speech in relation to commercial speech is subject to scrutiny by courts given the constitutional right to free speech time placement and manner restrictions it is the intent of this article to regulate the composition type location placement height size illumination and the duration of signs and advertising devices that may be displayed in adopting these sign regulations the mayor and council especially recognizes the vast number of court decisions coming from georgia courts the federal courts and courts throughout the united states which recognize that the regulation of the size location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the intentions and purposes of this article and that such intentions and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests the regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this article noncommercial and commercial messages in imposing sign regulations all landowners need to be equally protected in terms of expression of noncommercial messages landowners and occupants have the right to free speech including political speech even when there is no election upcoming one would not expect commercial messages to be needed on a lot used exclusively for residential purposes this means that sign regulations for residential zoning districts can more or less prevent signage to accommodate commercial messages but yet those restrictions must respect first amendment rights to free speech and also accommodate nonresidential uses that may exist or are allowed in residential zoning districts a sign code can protect the rights to noncommercial speech by not specifying the content of messages  thus any sign allowed by a given ordinance could display a noncommercial message even if such sign is most likely going to be used to identify a business or establishment or provide direction to such establishments on or offsite signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development variation required not all lots parcels or properties are equal when it comes to the need for signs signs along state highways are generally greater in area and height not only because of the desire to allow commercial messages but also because motorist travel speeds ie posted speed limits are typically greater than in residential neighborhoods there is evidence that larger signs are needed for legibility and visibility on state highways given their greater motor vehicle speeds ie less time to view a message and greater width of the right of way which increases distance of the motorist to sign messages and thus decreases legibility and visibility regulation by zoning district the zoning district is an appropriate means of regulating signs because generally a character is established by each zoning district see the citys adopted comprehensive plan the needs for signage differ remarkably among singlefamily residential zoning districts from zoning districts allowing business which in turn differ significantly from business parks lowrise office complexes and industrial establishments greater sign heights and areas are appropriate in business and industrial zones when compared with residential zoning districts proportionality the relationship of sign characteristics area and height for example especially wall signs to the building on which it is attached is very important in terms of aesthetics without regulation signage placed on walls can be too large in proportion to the building faade similarly sign codes need to accommodate the differences in size scale and height of different buildings for instance if an absolute maximum sign area is established it may be appropriate proportionally for a certain size of building but inappropriate too small and also out of proportion to a very large building for this reason it is appropriate to regulate wall signage on the basis of the percentage of area of the building faade similar a proportionality regulation is considered appropriate for window signage an industrial establishment with large wall areas does not have the same needs as a commercial establishment in this regard and is appropriately limited to a smaller percentage of wall area used for signs and advertising than a commercial establishment rationale for sign allowances a in addition to regulation by zoning district by which sign height and maximum sign area are distinguishable the uses permitted within zoning districts can range from residential to institutional commercial and industrial land uses sometimes nonresidential uses are permitted in residential zones and sign regulations need to account for the needs to identify such nonresidential establishments in residential zoning districts but yet ensure that such signs are compatible by way of height and area appropriate to a residentially zoned area the regulations adopted in this ordinance distinguish between different land uses and assign different sign permissions based on such land use for instance signage allowances differ among a lot with a single dwelling a lot containing a single non signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development residential principal permitted use which can occur in virtually any zoning district and a lot containing more than one permitted principal use or more than one building such as shopping centers and office parks the regulations also define allowable signage for vacant lots b residential uses do not require identification other than by street address however nonresidential uses whether in residential or nonresidential zoning districts usually do require identification of some sort this is why a principal use ground sign is allowed for nonresidential but not for singlefamily residential uses  while intended to serve primarily establishment identification needs principal use ground signs are not limited in the message and therefore may be used in total or in part to carry a noncommercial message each land use type including vacant lots are permitted an accessory ground sign  which is intended to allow for reasonable noncommercial speech for each lot owner or resident for nonresidential land uses the need for accessory messaging is greater than for lots with single dwellings and therefore more than one accessory ground sign is allowed c with regard to wall signage there is no need to have signs attached to single dwellings but nonresidential establishments have the need to identify uses within buildings this is why a residential dwelling does not allow wall signs other than that described for temporary durations in the event of lease or sale while nonresidential uses regardless of zoning district are allowed wall and window signage proportional to the building or area within which a sign can be placed real estaterelated messages although a content neutral sign code cannot describe and regulate signs related to the sale or lease of real estate the sign code must still accommodate these needs the needs of lot and building or leased space owners to market the sale and lease of properties and buildings can be accommodated with a durationtype sign allowance  ie a special sign allowance during the time a lot building or part of building is for sale or lease the sign regulations therefore provide for signs advertising a building or lot for sale or for lease during the time such lot or building or portion thereof is for sale or lease  these regulations accommodate such signage needs as ground signs as well as wall and window signs sign prohibitions given the objectives of the city it is appropriate to prohibit signs and other advertising devices where if used frequently by multiple businesses would create an appearance of clutter information overload and distractions to motorist safety certain advertising devices such as windblown or airblown devices create movement that distracts motorists and such devices are not fundamentally necessary to attract customers in light of other signage and advertising allowances signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development billboards due to their large areas billboards are inherently incompatible with the goals and objectives for development and community character as established in the citys adopted comprehensive plan because this sign ordinance allows for any type of message on any type of lawful sign it is unnecessary to allow large signs that are inconsistent with the citys desired character and not fundamentally necessary in terms of providing additional opportunity for messages that may be classified informally as off site the purposes served by billboards are reasonably accommodated by other signs but with smaller areas and at lower heights than would be accomplished with billboards the city recognizes that billboards that exist even though they may not be in compliance with the citys sign allowances can be continued and cannot be amortized per federal law andor court cases illumination the city recognizes that the lighting of signs has a significant effect on the character of districts a number of problems with external lighting have long been recognized including light trespass light pollution sky glow and brightness and glare which can detract from drivers during hours of darkness in addition the city finds that signs which are internally illuminated create an appearance of a nonresidential or business area which is inappropriate in residential zones it is reasonable and appropriate to establish regulations for the lighting of signs depending on zoning district and also based on the type of sign there is no compelling reason why signs of a temporary nature should be or need to be illuminated multiple message electronic signs pose unique challenges regarding the visual environment and traffic safety unless regulated it is appropriate for aesthetics compatibility and other objectives as well as for energy purposes that lighted signs be restricted from utilizing lighting when the establishment is not open advertising for special events certain advertising devices such as banners or inflatable signs are not normally appropriate given the objectives of the city to maintain aesthetics and to prevent inappropriate competition among establishments for attention while it is appropriate to disallow the general use of airblown devices banners and inflatable signs it is considered appropriate in the city to permit businesses and establishments to occasionally use such advertising devices typically for a limited duration for special events such as grand openings and going out of business sales flags flying the american flag is one of the most fundamental rights of every person in the united states federal protections have been instigated to protect that right it is not the intent to prevent the display of the american flag on any sign although it is also appropriate to restrict the use of flags as an advertising medium the city finds that the flying of flags whether the nations flag or any other can be abused specifically businesses in an effort to outdo their competitors or to stand out in the complex visual environment of messaging will sometimes install flags on light posts or place multiple small flags along street frontages other businesses may if unregulated signs and advertising devices powder springs ga unified development choose to fly uncolored flags in multiple locations just to gain attention these situations are not considered responsible displays of the american flag and are considered abuses for advertising purposes the use of flags as an advertising or attentionattracting medium deserves regulation accordingly it is appropriate to regulate flags including colored flags without sign copy to ensure the citys various objectives are met while at the same time safeguarding the rights of individuals establishments and property owners to demonstrate allegiance to the nation a state a city or a private establishment the regulations pertaining to the size height and manner of displaying flags is intended to permit such expressions of allegiances while preventing the potential abuses the copy or content of flags is not regulated by this article sign maintenance the city finds that signs if improperly maintained present an unkempt appearance and may present an image of blight to visitors residents and employees it is in the interest of the city to ensure that signs are properly maintained to avoid the appearance of blight and also to prevent possible detrimental impact on property values that may result from such blight architectural review in some parts of cities such as neighborhoods or business areas containing buildings of historic or cultural significance the impact of signage on aesthetics and character is more intense and of even greater concern to the city historic and downtown business districts to maintain character need special scrutiny with regard to the materials and appearance of signs accordingly it is appropriate to require architectural review of signs in order to maintain and enhance the harmony and character of the visual setting of such district or districts regulatory relief it is acknowledged that no set of sign regulations can anticipate all situations relative to sign needs it is further acknowledged that sign regulations may impose undue burdens on property owners and occupants accordingly it is appropriate to have a procedure in the form of a variance

to table 72 a number of street frontages the number of signs generally follows the rationale that a property owner with more than 1 property frontage abutting a street may have signs on both frontages whereas a property owner with only 1 street frontage would be allowed only 1 such sign b type of street frontage local streets have lower posted speeds and lower driving speeds when compared with state routes table 72 provides larger areas for certain signs for lots fronting on state routes because posted speed limits and driving speeds are generally higher than those established for local streets c vacant or undeveloped lot one distinction made in table 72 is whether the property is developed or undeveloped vacant properties have some sign allowance under the premise that the regulation must provide for the property owner to express opinion or provide information additional signage on a vacant lot is allowed during the time the land is for sale rent or lease or under construction as it is on developed lots as well d number of buildings the sign allowances in table 72 vary based on the number of buildings on the lot and the use of the building more than one permitted principal use or more than one building have different sign allowances than lots with a single building e zoning district the sign allowances in table 72 vary the allowable area of certain signs based on zoning district the purposes of that variation is to seek proportionality and compatibility with respect to the neighborhood area character and adjacent or nearby land uses the area allowances reflect an intent to maintain a pedestrianscale with respect to signs in residential mixed use and other zoning districts while permitting signs with greater area in community commercial

loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities c effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection measures can protect human life and health  minimize damage to private property  minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the public d flood hazard areas can also serve important stormwater management water quality streambank protection stream corridor protection wetlands preservation and
