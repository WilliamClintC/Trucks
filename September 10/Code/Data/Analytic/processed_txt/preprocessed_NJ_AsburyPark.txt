constitution which guarantee freedom of expression as well as the position of the courts in protecting that freedom by invalidating any attempt by local ordinance to restrict particular uses based upon their content however the mayor and council also recognize their duty to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of asbury park from the adverse impact that a concentration of certain uses have been shown to exert on the property values of adjoining and proximate residential and commercial property of particular concern is the  30763 general provisions  30763  potential concentration of adult bookstores and establishments that provide adult entertainment which are distinguished from conventional bookstores and entertainment establishments by the fact that they are required to exclude access to minors by virtue of age under the pornography statutes of the state of new jersey in promulgating the conditions for permitting adult restricted establishments listed below the mayor and council considered the experience of recent years where two 2 or more adult establishments had located within a three 3 block area of the beachfront district between fourth avenue and cookman avenue near kingsley street and contributed to the economic decline of the beachfront by discouraging families with children from patronizing the beach and conventional commercial establishments in the area this adverse effect was recognized by the mayor and council in 198 when the area described above was included within a larger area of the beachfront declared blighted and for which a redevelopment plan is now in effect in order to control the location and prevent the concentration of adult uses and thereby protect the public welfare and support the progress of redevelopment adult bookstores and establishments of adult entertainment as defined in  3015 will be permitted in commercial zones within the city where conventional bookstores and entertainment establishments are also permitted uses except that a conditional use permit shall first be issued by the planning board for such adult bookstore or establishment or adult entertainment the planning board may issue a conditional use permit only after an applicant has demonstrated compliance with the following standards and conditions 1 the application shall include a complete statement setting forth all the particulars of the structure and the proposed use thereof 2 based upon past experience as described in this section and an analysis of block dimensions typical of commercial zones within the city by the office of planning and zoning as well as studies of skid row uses performed in other urban areas such as detroit michigan and elsewhere the mayor and council has determined that a minimum distance equal to the greater of two 2 full city blocks or one thousand 1000 feet will be required between a proposed adult bookstore or establishment of adult entertainment and any existing adult bookstore or establishment of adult entertainment to achieve adequate dispersion of adult uses for purposes of measurement the required distance of separation shall be measured between the nearest property lines and along public streets so that city tax maps may be used 3 because the city contains residential neighborhoods in close proximity to commercial areas wherein adult uses might be permitted and because it is determined to be in the public interest to provide adequate separation between such residential neighborhoods with their attendant support uses such as schools  30763
