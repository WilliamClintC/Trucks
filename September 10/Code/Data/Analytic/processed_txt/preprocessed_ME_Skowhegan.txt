footpath there exists complete natural ground cover consisting of forest duff shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet of the normal highwater line where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of native shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of storm water d a written plan by the property owner including a scaled site drawing is approved by the planning board and is developed implemented and maintained to address the following mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland zone i unstabilized areas resulting in soil erosion must be mulched seeded or otherwise stabilized and maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to water bodies and wetlands ii roofs and associated drainage systems driveways parking areas and other nonvegetated surfaces must be designed or modified as necessary to prevent concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a water body or wetland where possible runoff must be directed vegetated area or infiltrated into the soil use of a dry well

the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other on site soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 9 3 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than fifty percent 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within one 1 year of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c 1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c 2 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by fifty percent 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in c 2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 4 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body tributary stream or wetland or on the subject or adjacent
