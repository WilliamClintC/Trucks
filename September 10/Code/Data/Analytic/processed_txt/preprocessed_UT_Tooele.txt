oriented businesses and their owners operators and employees is an appropriate and reasonable means of enforcing regulatory controls aimed at addressing secondary effects 4 requiring owners operators performers and other key employees in sexually oriented businesses to make certain disclosures which are substantially related to the governments significant interest in preventing criminal activity and controlling the spread of disease 5 imposing interior design requirements upon sexually oriented businesses will assist managers in supervising the activities of patrons and employees thereby helping prevent illicit behavior from occurring on the premises 6 studies have shown that when multiple sexually oriented businesses are located in close proximity to each other the impact of secondary effects on the surrounding neighborhood is intensified and multiplied8 7 imposing reasonable distance requirements between sexually oriented business locations is an appropriate means of preventing the concentration of secondary effects 8 it is appropriate and reasonable to limit sexually oriented businesses to zones in which they are least likely to negatively impact residential neighborhoods children or retail commercial activities  zoning restrictions should be crafted in such a way as to minimize the impact of secondary effects upon vulnerable populations without unreasonably restricting access to those seeking legal sexually oriented entertainment or materials 9 sexual acts including masturbation and oral sex frequently occur in booths and other unregulated spaces within sexually oriented businesses  this results in the accumulation of semen and creates unsanitary conditions 10 aids syphilis and gonorrhea are spread primarily contact 11 prohibiting sexual acts regulating other forms of physical contact between employees and patrons and requiring the elimination of certain closed spaces within sexually oriented businesses will reduce risks to the

development overlay district when used in conjunction with the requirements of the base or underlying zoning district is to permit flexibility in subdivision and site planning to promote the efficient utilization of resources and to preserve and protect valuable site features and to add desired amenities for the neighborhood or area the application of the planned unit development overlay district is intended to promote the achievement of quality neighborhood and site design while complying with the policies of the tooele city general plan and the requirements of the zoning intent of the

definition planned unit development pud is a site plan or subdivision layout technique allowing buildings and structures with some or all of the lots reduced below the minimum lot sizes andor differing setback standards than required by the base zoning district but where the overall project or site area meets the density standard of the zoning district while the underlying zoning district establishes the allowed use and densities the planned unit development overlay district allows flexibility in the general configuration of the subdivision or site plan area development areas being proposed as a planned unit development require that the planning for lots and the locations of buildings and structures be achieved in a coordinated functional and unified manner  763 allowed uses the planned unit development overlay district does not establish or identify any of the uses allowed within an area or proposed development site rather it is the underlying zoning district which

purposes of this ordinance are 1 to regulate personal wireless services antennas with or without support structures and related electronic equipment and equipment structures 2 to provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the city 3 to minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the colocation of multiple antennas on a single structure by encouraging the location of antennas on preexisting support structures and by encouraging the use of cityowned property for antenna support structures 4 to establish siting appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities 5 to comply with the telecommunications act of 1996 by establishing regulations that a do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services  b do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services  c are not based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions other than the requirement that such facilities comply with the federal communication commissions regulations concerning such emissions  7273 findings the city council makes the following findings 1 personal wireless services devices are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving telecommunications industry and present unique zoning challenges and concerns for the city 2 the city needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the city against the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health safety welfare and aesthetics and orderly planning of the community 3 the city has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the city and expects the increased demand to continue into the future 4 it is in the best interests of the city to have quality personal wireless services available which necessarily entails the erection of personal wireless services facilities in the city 5 the unnecessary proliferation of personal wireless services facilities throughout the city creates a negative visual impact on the community 6 the visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their siting construction maintenance and use 7 spacing personal wireless services facilities evenly throughout the city reduces the negative impact created by the proliferation of telecommunication towers 8 because of the height and appearance of personal wireless services facilities surrounding properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower 9 a private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility even though numerous other property owners in the area are adversely affected by the location of the facility 10 encouraging personal wireless services facilities to be located on city property with lease payments paid to the city instead of an individual property owner indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities and is therefore the fairest method of distributing burden and benefit 11 locating antennas on existing buildings and structures creates less of a negative visual impact on the community than the erection of towers 12 buildings and structures on public property can accommodate antenna arrays thus reducing the proliferation of towers in all areas of the city 13 the public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on existing structures located on city owned property 14 stealth facilities which are facilities designed to disguise the presence of telecommunications facilities are preferable to towers and other obtrusive support structures which create an unmitigated aesthetic impact on 7101  surrounding property 15 because of the obtrusive height and size of telecommunications support structures such facilities have a more substantial negative visual impact in residential areas than in commercial or industrial areas which frequently contain other high profile structures 16 the site location requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of personal wireless services are necessary to protect the heath safety and general welfare of the community 17 utah grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of telecommunication towers in order to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area the law also allows the city to require the owner of any tower to accommodate the multiple use of the tower by other companies where feasible and to pay the city the fair market rental value for the use of any cityowned site  7274

7281 purpose 7282 definition 7283 guidelines 7284 analysis 7285 appeal 7286 limitation 7287 legal action 7281 purpose the purpose of this to provide advisory guidelines and procedures to assist the city in identifying and analyzing actions that may involve the taking of private real property without payment of just compensation as required by the constitutions of the united states and the state of utah  7282 definition as used herein the term constitutional taking issues means actions involving the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by the city that might require compensation to a private real property owner under 1 the fifth or fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution  2 of the utah constitution  or 3 any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of private real property  7283 guidelines when the city is proposing to take action that will affect private real property the city shall determine whether the contemplated action may involve constitutional taking issues a yes answer to any of the following questions could raise the possibility of a taking of private real property for which just compensation may be required 1 does the action result in a permanent or recurring physical occupation of private property 2 does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an easement to the city 3 does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent or ongoing nuisance originating on city property that impacts neighboring lands so that their owners or occupants sustain a special and unreasonable interference with the quiet enjoyment of their property 4 does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership such as the right to reasonable access the right to light air and view within the rightofright way of an abutting public street or the right to exclude others from private property 5 does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected and vested right such as the right to continue a nonconforming use  the right to have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a complete application was submitted  the right to obtain legally issued subdivision plat approvals building permits or licenses  or other protected property interests 6 does the action impose a severe economic burden that is inappropriately unfair when considered in light of a the burden placed on the property owner b the nature of the government action and benefit and c the property owners investmentbacked expectations 7 does the action deprive the property owner of all economically viable use of the property in a situation where the proposed use does not constitute a nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety 8 does the action limit the use of private property without substantially advancing a legitimate public interest 9 can the city demonstrate by an individualized determination that any conditions dedications or exactions imposed as a condition of approval of development applications place only fair and roughly proportionate burdens on development offsetting the burdens that the proposed development places on public utilities streets and other services but not imposing additional burdens on development that the community as a whole should bear 10 does the action discriminate against property owners imposing restrictions or burdens on one property owner that other similarly situated property owners do not bear  7284 analysis if the city determines that a proposed governmental action involves constitutional taking issues the city shall review and analyze the possible taking to determine the course to be taken in reviewing the proposed action the following factors shall be considered 1 the effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property  2 the likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking  3 any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the citys lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking  4 the cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is determined  7285 appeal any private property owner whose interest in the property is subject to a physical or regulatory taking by the city pursuant to a final and authoritative decision or action of the city may appeal the citys decision or action by filing a written

furnished by a parent or guardian 4 such aerosol containers and markers are frequently stolen from retail stores by such persons 5 the sale of such aerosol containers and markers to such persons should therefore be prohibited and persons who are engaged in the retail sale of such aerosol containers and markers should be required to take reasonable steps to prevent the theft of such aerosol containers and markers 6 when appropriate the courts should require those who commit acts of defacement of public or private property application of graffiti to restore the property so defaced damaged or destroyed 7 obtaining convictions for the application of graffiti is difficult due to the fact that the offense can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the act are
