hereby finds that 1 excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of residential dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways and the creation of recreational facilities  2 the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  3 soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys washed out fills and embankments  4 sediment from soil erosion and accumulated random debris both tend to clog sewers waterways and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes and reservoirs  5 the deliberate or unintentional disposition of sediment debris or unwanted materials limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and 6 the deliberate or unintentional disposition of sediment debris or unwanted materials interferes with obstructs restricts and reduces the efficient conveyance capacity of waterways resulting in increased chances of flooding which may create hazards to persons damage to property and threaten public health safety comfort and welfare b purpose the council therefore declares that the purpose of this to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating

activities within the city and to the preparation of the submissions required under of this  development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2 natural vegetation should be required and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed wherever possible 3 the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 4 sediment basins debris basins desilting basins or silt traps or filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development 5 the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved 6 in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 7 provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion 8 permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development b

in accordance with the following classifications types of recreation area minimum size range minimum acres per 1000 people 1 play lot 8000 square feet not applicable 2 school  park neighborhood playground minimum park of 5 acres 125 3 neighborhood park 5 acres 10  sterling codifiers inc  289470 4 districtwide park or play field 10 acres 125 5 communitywide recreation park 15 acres 20 total 55 acres of land per 1000 people the amount of land required to be dedicated shall be determined by dividing the estimated population of the proposed development by one thousand 1000 and multiplying the quotient times five and onehalf 55 acres of park land required for each one thousand 1000 people b location the city plans in conjunction with the local park district plans shall be used as guidelines in locating sites a central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable in large developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances c credit for private open spaces recreation areas and tax assessments when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the city council be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the city council based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the city and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents private swimming clubs are included in this provision when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given d buildable area each park site shall include a two hundred foot by two hundred fifty foot 200 x 250 site for a park building and a one hundred fifty foot by one hundred fifty foot 150 x 150 site for tennis courts with uniform soil bearing capacity of at least three thousand 3000 psi based on soil boring data to be furnished by the developer e improvements each park site shall be located on a fully improved street with sewer electricity and gas available at the property lines enclosed drainage curb and gutter and streetlights shall be included if

metropolitan sanitary district of greater chicago or 2 us department of agriculture adequate clay seals with overlapping top soil shall be placed upon exposed peat areas within any required play field areas where low swampy land is to be considered for dedication by the developer he shall provide an adequate outlet complying with all codes and regulations or if not drainable the areas shall be

requiring contribution in lieu of park sites where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes the city shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land dedication shall be held in trust by the city or other public body designated by the city solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within seven 7 years from the date of receipt it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution a fair market value the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that

planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when 1 only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have to be dedicated  2 a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is
