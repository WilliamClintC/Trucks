generally a this chapter is based upon the division of the village into districts within which the uses of land and the uses and bulk of buildings and structures are substantially uniform it is recognized however that there are special uses which because of their unique characteristics can only be properly classified in any particular district upon consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location such uses fall into three categories 1 uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest 2 uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give use to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property public
