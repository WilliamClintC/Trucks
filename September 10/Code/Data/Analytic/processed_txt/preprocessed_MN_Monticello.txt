testing procedures  acceptance test procedure with or without an inbuilding radio system it will be the building owners responsibility to have the regional radio system performance tested to ensure that twoway coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90% of the total floor area and the critical areas designated atalkin from the regional radio system coverage testing 1the talkin coverage testing process shall be the same for buildings with and without in building amplification systems 2during test measuring the center of the test equipment receive antenna shall be between 30 and 36 inches above the floor 3on each floor of a building to be tested the floor space except for designated critical areas shall be divided into square or rectangular areas of approximately the same size and shape each floor shall have at least ten grid areas  however the maximum size of grid areas shall not exceed 2500 square feet in buildings with support columns laid out in a grid the corners of the each grid may be arranged at the columns for ease in identifying grid comers while testing is in progress in buildings such as a warehouse with large open areas tests shall be conducted near the center of each grid although the exact center may not be easily accessible due to the location of large machinery storage racks and the like in buildings with divided office spaces with or without floor to ceiling partitions tests shall be conducted in an office at or near the center of a grid in buildings with a large open area and an attached twostory split level office or other area the lower level of the twostory split level attachment shall be considered as an extension of the large open area 4in multistory buildings and parking ramps testing shall begin at the lowest level including any subgrade levels and continue up one floor at a time inbuilding amplification may only be required on the lowest level or levels of a multistory building or parking ramp 5average radio signal field strength shall be measured and recorded in each grid and in each designated critical area defined above average field strength may be obtained of an instantaneous measuring instrument and a computer that samples the actual field strength at very short time intervals and averages the sample values as an alternative a field strength measuring instrument with an analog or digital readout of average field strength may also be used measurements shall be made while the measuring instrument is moved over a distance of four to ten feet if the average field strength varies over the measurement path the lowest most negative value shall be recorded the test instrumentation used shall have been calibrated within the sixmonth period prior to the testing 6the percentage of area passed shall be calculated as 100 times the result of dividing the number of grids and critical areas that are at least at 93 dbm or 1% ber by the total number of grids and critical areas tested 7the donor antenna in an inbuilding amplification system may receive up to 87 800 mhz radio frequencies of approximately equal field strength from the regional system plus some others of approximately equal field strength from other radio systems at any time the donor antenna may be receiving at least 60 radio frequencies of approximately equal level in the pass band ranges for that reason it shall be assumed that the output level of talkin amplifiers will be at + 32 dbm per channel maximum therefore grid and critical areas tests shall be conducted while the headend amplifier is disconnected and a signal of + 32 dbm is inserted into the connector downstream from the headend amplifier 8any inbuilding talkin amplification system shall have pass band filters before the input to the first headend amplifier that shall pass 806 to 817 mhz and 821 to 824 mhz only in the future within six months after notification by the fire chief or his designee the pass band filter frequency range shall be changed in accordance with instructions or an additional pass band filter for 700 mhz band frequencies shall be added when the donor antenna is installed the average signal level received on the hennepin east site control channel shall be measured at the antenna connector a signal at that average received signal level shall be inserted into the cable to the headend amplifier and filter while the output level of the headend amplifier is measured and the output level of the amplifier shall be set at + 29 + 1 dbm 9alternative inbuilding amplification systems that do not involve broadband pass band filters will be accepted provided that similar testing can be demonstrated btalkout to the regional radio system testing 1with an inbuilding amplification system the talkout to the regional

1 findings intent and incorporation by reference a the city has determined that wetlands serve to maintain water quality by filtering water that is discharged into ground water aquifers and by retaining inorganic sediments toxicants and nutrients they also retain and reduce the discharge of phosphorus and transform nutrients from their inorganic to organic forms thereby protecting streams and water bodies from eutrophication and contamination wetlands also store runoff and reduce the velocity of and magnitude of flood peaks in addition some wetlands receive the upward discharge of ground water these wetlands tend to support more stable biological communities since their water temperatures and water levels tend to be more stable b wetland vegetation also reduces the energy of waves currents and other erosive forces and serves to prevent the erosion of shoreline areas in addition aquatic vegetation provides food shelter and special habitat for wildlife all of these wetland characteristics provide valuable recreation and education resources c the city has also found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered wetlands within the city exhibit great variations in their floral variety quality of wildlife and fishery habitat degree of fluctuation in response to storms the extent to which their shorelines have been altered or eroded and their relative value in protecting water quality therefore the city has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to classify wetlands based upon their functions and values the city has also found that it is in the best interest of the general health and welfare of the city to achieve no net loss of wetlands within the community d the city recognizes that a substantial amount of wetland degradation results from sedimentation and nutrient loading related to construction projects therefore the city finds it necessary to require extraordinary measures to prevent such construction related degradation e in addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the city also finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of lands surrounding wetlands wetland buffer strips as defined in of this ordinance are necessary and beneficial to maintaining the health of wetlands these strips of land surrounding wetlands protect their shorelines from erosion while serving to filter sediment chemicals and other nutrients chapter 3 zoning districts overlay zoning districts d wetland district city of monticello zoning before storm water discharges into the wetland buffer strips are also beneficial in providing habitat for wildlife f this section hereby incorporates by reference the wetlands conservation act of 1991 minn stat 103g221 et seq herein after referred to as the wca and any future amendments adopted by the legislature any activities exempted from the provisions of the wca are also exempted from the requirements of this section insofar as they relate to the wca all wetlands as defined in of this ordinance including those governed by the department of natural resources are covered by the other provisions of this ordinance also there are circumstances under which the strict enforcement of these regulations may be unreasonable and in circumstances that meet the criteria established in c of this ordinance departures from the strict application of these standards may be permitted g it is the intent of d to avoid the alteration and destruction of wetlands when wetlands are altered or destroyed mitigation must be provided to recreate the functions and values of the lost wetland 2 purpose and implementation a through the adoption and enforcement of this section the city shall promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation as provided for in the wca when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this section the city seeks to accomplish the following purposes i to satisfy the requirements of the wca as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city  ii to balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city  iii to preserve the natural character of the landscape maintenance of wetland ecosystems  iv to promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water to retain sediment and toxicants and filter and strip nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into community lakes and streams thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features  and chapter 3 zoning districts overlay zoning districts d wetland district  city of monticello zoning v to provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of variety of both plant and animal species within the city b to accomplish these purposes the city will i maintain an inventory of all wetlands within the city  ii maintain a system of classification for wetlands within the city and classify the citys wetlands based upon their relative values related to floral variety wildlife habitat water quality protection fishery habitat flood storage shoreline protection and aesthetic recreational and education benefits iii prepare and maintain a comprehensive set of official maps identifying the location and classification of all wetlands within the city iv establish wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood plain and shoreland protection regulations v require sound management practices to protect conserve maintain enhance and improve the quality of wetlands within the community vi enforce standards for the alteration of wetlands when alteration is allowed including standards and procedures for the mitigation of the loss of wetland areas and their functions and values when alteration or destruction occurs vii obtain protective easements over or acquire fee title to wetlands as appropriate viii develop and maintain a program to educate the public about the numerous benefits and features that wetlands provide and the adverse effects of improperly managed urban development on

city of monticello zoning figure 46 faade height & width ensuring similar faade height and width dimensions of opposing faades can be an effective means of establishing a transition between uses 3 graduate building height and mass in the form of building stepbacks or other techniques so that structures with a higher intensity have a comparable scale with adjacent structures housing lower intensity uses  figure 47 step back construction stepbacks in building heights between different use types can be an effective transitional element 4 use similarly sized and patterned architectural

orient porches balconies outdoor space and other site attributes such as vending machines associated with attached residential development away from adjacent detached residential uses  9 orient primary building faades directly across from opposing primary faades regardless of use type as seen in figure 49  and figure 49 parallel primary facades organizing buildings so that the primary faades

unusual plant species invasive or exotic plant species are either absent or limited to small areas where some disturbance has occurred this higher level of plant species variety generally provides

quality and provide excellent opportunities for educational and scientific activities within the community wetlands high quality high quality wetlands are still generally in their natural state and

however a minimum of twenty 20 different species can be found within the basin there tends to be little evidence of water level fluctuation due to storms and their shorelines are stable with little evidence of erosion the combination of these factors result in these wetlands being judged as providing a greater level of water quality protection and significantly better wildlife habitat they show little if any evidence of human influences and their greater levels of species variety wildlife habitat and ecological stability results in higher aesthetic quality these characteristics also offer opportunities for educational or scientific value to the community wetlands low quality wetlands included in this category have been substantially altered by agricultural or urban development that caused over nutrification soil erosion sedimentation and water quality degradation as a result of these factors these wetlands exhibit low levels of plant species and a related reduction in the quality of wildlife habitat these wetlands may also tend to exhibit extreme water level fluctuations in response to storms and show evidence of shoreline erosion while these wetlands do provide for water quality and serve an important role in protecting water quality downstream the combination of these characteristics cause these wetlands to provide low levels of water quality protection and to have poor aesthetic quality they often exhibit evidence of significant human influences and they are deemed to be of little educational or scientific value to the community wetlands medium quality medium quality wetlands have a slightly higher number of plant species present than low quality wetlands often with small pockets of indigenous species within larger areas dominated by invasive or exotic species their relatively greater species variety results in slightly better wildlife habitat they exhibit evidence of relatively less fluctuation in water level in response to storms and less
