adopt the following floodplain management regulations  1 art i  a  findings of fact a the city of clinton is subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  1 art i  b  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  1 art i  c  objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the

house or a side addition was built off the kitchen some shotguns had as few as two rooms chimneys tended to be built in the interior allowing the front and middle rooms to share a chimney with a fireplace opening in each room the kitchen usually had its own chimney other than the basic floor layout shotgun houses had many standard features in common the houses was almost always close to the

providers afsps as defined by this these alternative nonbank financial service providers offer convenient services and access to cash their services often carry high costs limiting the ability of individuals or families to accumulate assets and establish a good credit history furthermore there is evidence that there is the potential for abuse of customers utilizing such providers the financial performance of afsps is enhanced by their ability to generate repeat customers  that is customers that repeatedly roll over high priced day loans studies have found that when customers of afsps roll over highcost shortterm loans they can easily end up trapped in a vicious cycle that can result in them paying substantially more in fees than the amount borrowed commissioner of banks data suggest that while less than half of all afsp customers took out more than 7 loans during 200 these customers accounted close to three quarters of total revenue for the industry it is also the purpose of this district to regulate the operation and location of adult entertainment establishments for the purposes of 1 stemming a potential increase in criminal activities and disturbances of the peace and good
