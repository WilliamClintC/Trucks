provide the citizens of mount prospect a safe prosperous and healthy community in which to live and work to consistently meet this objective requires the coordinated efforts of many individuals and municipal departments including those responsible for maintaining the infrastructure of the village components of this infrastructure include streets sidewalks sewers buildings and trees healthy trees are unique in that they appreciate in value as they mature unlike other components of the infrastructure that continually depreciate over time trees provide a wide range of benefits to the village healthy trees reduce air and noise pollution slow stormwater runoff contribute to energy conservation protection from the wind and significantly increase property values trees need sufficient soil water and air to survive protecting existing natural resources and planning for the establishment and care of new trees will enhance the economic and environmental health of the village the purpose of this article is to promote and protect public health and safety by providing for the proper establishment of new trees the protection and maintenance of existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous or undesirable trees   sterling codifiers inc  154724  goals the provisions contained in the village of mount prospect urban forest protection and planning ordinance are designed to yield specific goals when properly implemented these goals include a maintain a healthy urban forest the urban forest of mount prospect is a dynamic ecosystem comprised of trees soil water air wildlife and humans proper stewardship of the ecosystem is the most efficient and economical method of ensuring a safe and relatively hazard free environment for the citizens of mount prospect b promote age and species diversity of the tree population the long term health of mount prospects urban forest depends on a proper distribution of young middle aged and mature trees adequate stocking of variously aged trees ensures that as mature trees decline and are removed younger trees are available to fill in the canopy species diversity is also important to guard against substantial losses to a species specific pest or disease such as dutch elm disease c improve species and site selection for new tree plantings increasing species diversity will only improve the urban forest if the species are matched with the site in which they are growing large trees provide the greatest benefits relative to energy conservation air quality and stormwater retention but require sufficient space to reach their full size at maturity large growing trees shall not be planted directly under existing power lines small trees can be used in a variety of places that are size restricted however if a space will accommodate a tree that achieves a larger size at maturity the larger growing species should be considered the proper tree should be located according to the conditions of the site with consideration given to increasing canopy closure maximizing environmental benefits and achieving consistency in the landscape design d establish optimum canopy closure trees help to conserve energy by providing shade to buildings during the summer additional cooling can be realized by shading roads and parking lots that would otherwise absorb sunlight and radiate heat since mount prospect is located in a climate where considerably more energy is spent on heating than cooling consideration must also be given to the effect of shade on heating costs in the winter careful consideration of the establishment of new trees will result in the optimum canopy closure relative to energy conservation e resolution and prevention of treehardscape conflicts through coordinated planning trees require space for roots trunk and branches frequently the space occupied by portions of trees is needed for other elements of the infrastructure such as roads sewers utility lines and buildings conflicts between trees and other infrastructure components can be minimized of the various village departments local utility companies and citizens the provisions of this article are intended to facilitate communication and cooperation between those individuals and agencies charged with maintaining mount prospects infrastructure f promote public education and support the primary reason to care for trees and natural resources in mount prospect is to improve the community for its citizens the urban forest management program must be based on the informed support of the citizens a goal of this article is to provide proper tree care professional management based on knowledge those village employees responsible for the management of natural resources in mount prospect are also responsible for sharing their knowledge and sources of information with the public g facilitate the resolution of tree related conflicts a goal of this article is to make available reasonable and fair guidelines for maintaining healthy structurally sound and safe trees and providing a comprehensive standards manual for planting pruning and removing trees by providing these guidelines in a clear and understandable format equal and fair treatment is guaranteed for all residents   home rule authority and severability it is the intent of this article to help coordinate the efforts of those responsible for the care

thirty inches by thirty inches 30 x 30 where greater emphasis on visibility is required a larger size may be used on low volume local and secondary streets with low approach speeds a twenty four inch by twenty four inch 24 x 24 size may be used b at a multiway stop intersection a supplementary plate should be mounted just below each stop sign if the number of approach legs to the intersection is three 3 or more the numeral on the supplementary plate shall correspond to the actual legs or the legend all way may be used the supplementary plate shall have white letters on a red background and shall have a standard size of twelve inches by six inches 12 x 6 or eighteen inches by six inches 18 x 6 where accident frequency at an intersection does not meet the warrants for a fourway stop sign but is considered a hazard a supplementary plate may be added with the legend thru traffic c a stop sign beacon or beacons may be used in conjunction with a stop sign d secondary messages shall not be used on stop sign faces 2 warrants a preamble because the stop sign causes a substantial inconvenience to motorists it should be used only when warranted a stop sign may be warranted at an intersection where one or more of the following conditions exist 1 intersection of a minor street with another minor street where application of the normal rightofway rule is unduly hazardous 2 intersection of a local street with a collector street or an arterial street  sterling codifiers inc  517724 3 intersection of two 2 collector or arterial streets where no traffic signal is present 4 unsignalized intersection in a signalized area 5 other intersections where a condition of high speed restricted view serious accident record or daily public assemblage indicates a need for control by a stop sign note where two 2 main highways intersect the stop sign or signs should normally be posted on the minor street to stop the lesser flow of traffic traffic engineering studies however may justify the installation of a stop sign or signs on the major street as at a threeway intersection where safety considerations may justify stopping the greater flow of traffic to permit a leftturning movement b the multiway stop installation has been found useful as a safety measure at some locations it should ordinarily be used where the volume of traffic on the intersecting streets is approximately equal any of the following conditions may warrant a multiway stop sign installation 1 where traffic signals are soon to be installed to reduce cross traffic hazard warranted and urgently needed the multiway stop is an interim measure that can be installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the signal installation 2 an accident problem as indicated by five 5 or more reported accidents of a type susceptible of correction by a multiway stop sign installation in a twelve 12 month period such accidents include right and leftturn collisions as well as rightangle collisions 3 other usage and nonusage a stop signs also may be erected facing traffic entering a street or highway from cemeteries parks parking lots and private roads b no definite rule can be established to govern the placement of stop signs at wye junctions because of the variation of the direction of principal traffic movement 1 each wye junction shall be given individual study 2 as a general guide if the volume of traffic in the conflicting movements as either intersecting point of a wye junction is light and has a ratio of less than six 6 to one it is sufficient justification for stopping the larger traffic movement in favor of the smaller c no stop signs shall be erected at intersections where traffic control signals are present except as a temporary measure during signal maintenance of relatively short duration d portable stop signs shall never be used for school crossings or other parttime usages the efficiency of any stop sign as pedestrian protection is debatable and the reliance on traffic obedience of intermittent stop control without a flashingred indication as an attention attracting device is insufficient protection for school children d warrants for yield 1 the yield sign shall not be regarded as a substitute for a stop sign where a stop sign is warranted yield signs shall not be used a where visibility limitations or prevailing high speeds or volumes of traffic make a full stop necessary for safety b against the major flow of traffic at an intersection c on the approaches of more than one of the intersecting streets or highways d where there are stop signs on one or more approaches of an intersection except under unusual circumstances at complex intersections e on  the yield sign is warranted a on a minor street at the entrance to an intersection where it is necessary to assign rightofway to the major street but where a stop is not necessary at all times and where the safe approach speed on the minor road exceeds ten 10 miles per hour b within an intersection with a divided highway or at median openings facing traffic entering the second roadway of the divided highway where the median width exceeds thirty feet 30 c where there is a separate or channelized right turn lane without an adequate acceleration lane d at any intersection where a special problem exists and where an engineering study indicates the problem to be susceptible to correction by use of the yield sign 3 the yield sign shall be placed as near the intersecting roadway as possible but not more than fifty feet 50 away should the visibility to the sign be restricted a yield ahead sign may be erected in advance e location of stop sign and yield sign the location and proper erection of the control devices shall be in accordance
