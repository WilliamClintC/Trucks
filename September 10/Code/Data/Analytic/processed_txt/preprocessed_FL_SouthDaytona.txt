thus increasing community pride and the stability of neighborhoods  g providing attractive buffering between incompatible land uses  and h abating noise 3 native vegetation shall be promoted since it has adapted to local diseases pests soil and climate and is generally more economical and desirable than exotic species which require more pesticide fertilizer and water 4 because some trees are more beneficial than others the public benefits of tree protection may be obtained without preserving each and every tree 5 mangrove trees are especially valuable in stabilizing building and protecting the shoreline providing for spawning and breeding grounds for marine organisms and other wildlife and serving as the basis for most of the estuarine food chains which are critical to a substantial majority of those species considered important from a recreational andor commercial standpoint d traffic management 1 offstreet parking and loading of vehicles promote the public safety and welfare by reducing traffic congestion 2 welldesigned offstreet parking and loading areas promote the safe and efficient storage loading and circulation of vehicles 3 allowing the use of porous paving materials and unpaved parking areas whenever practical to do so aids the recharge of surficial aquifers moderates the microclimate and reduces the expense and hazards of controlling stormwater runoff e stormwater management 1 surface water runoff carries pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading quality  2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna  3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff thereby increasing erosion  4 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation increases erosion  5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  6 changes in the elevation of land may create or aggravate drainage problems on adjacent land  7 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of surface water runoff allowing less water to percolate into the soil and thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  8 improperly managed surface water runoff increases the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur thereby destroying property and causing loss of life  9 improperly managed surface water runoff interferes with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas  10 economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters  and 11 future problems can be avoided if developers provide for drainage in accordance with this chapter f floodplain protection 1 flooding is a natural recurring phenomenon in the city 2 naturally floodprone lands serve the following important functions in the regional hydrologic cycle and ecological system a they provide natural storage and conveyance of flood waters b they facilitate groundwater recharge c they provide temporary storage of surface waters that moderates flood elevations and the timing velocity and rate of flood discharges d they reduce erosion and filter nutrients sediments and other pollutants from flood waters e they export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish birds wildlife and native plant communities 3 naturally occurring flooding may provide recharge to groundwater and a basic source of flow to surface waters 4 the uncontrolled development of floodprone lands substantially degrades the health safety and welfare of the community in the following ways a the owners residents customers guests and employees occupying homes businesses and other structures located in floodprone areas are placed at unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage b expensive and dangerous search rescue and disaster relief operations may be necessary when developed properties are flooded c roads public facilities and utilities associated with development may be damaged by flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers d flooding of developed properties may lead to demands that the city construct expensive and environmentally damaging projects to control flood waters e normally floodfree lands are placed at risk of flooding when flood waters on natural floodprone areas are obstructed diverted displaced or channelized by development f water quality is degraded the supply of fresh water to estuaries is disrupted and habitat is lost g

adoption of the south daytona comprehensive plan all developments approved thereafter must be consistent with the plan in addition development must conform with the terms and conditions outlined in this consistency checklist as a prerequisite to the issuance of a development orderpermit under this the director shall be responsible for reviewing and approving a consistency checklist to determine whether or not the proposed orderpermit and development activity is consistent with the comprehensive plan and this checklist may be made prior to the submission or at the time of submission of an application for development permit 2 procedure if inconsistent if it is determined that the proposed development order would result in an inconsistency with the comprehensive plan and following actions may occur a the director may approve the proposed development with conditions necessary to bring the applicationrequest into conformance with the plan and   or b the director may initiate an amendment pursuant to this in order to facilitate a determination of consistency for a development permit when it is found that such amendment would not affect the intent character and public interest as determined by the comprehensive plan or this 2  concurrency management system a purpose the purpose of the concurrency management system cms described herein is to enable the city to comply with section  g of the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulation act fs which requires that the city implement local land development regulations which provide that public facilities and services meet or exceed the standards established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and are available when needed to meet the impacts of development and that not later than one year after the official due date of the citys comprehensive plan the city shall not issue a development order or permit resulting in a reduction in the levelofservice los for affected public facilities below the levelofservice adopted by the comprehensive plan the city also intends that the cms be consistent with rule 9j fac which provides guidelines to local governments for the preparation and implementation of a cms which will ensure the availability of public facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of development to ensure that facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development a local government must adopt a concurrency management system the citys concurrency management system shall measure the potential impact of any proposed development upon the levelsofservice for potable water sanitary sewer solid waste parks and recreation drainage and roadways by comparing that impact with available capacity and the citys adopted levelofservice standards for those public facilities no final development permit shall be approved unless the city has determined use of this mechanism that adequate public facilities will be available at the time of project impact b intent the city intends that the cms be functionally compatible with the citys character as an already substantially builtout municipality with virtually no potential for urban sprawl within a surrounding urban core this means that virtually all new development may be characterized as infill and its impact on facility levelsofservice should be relatively minor the city intends that the concurrency management system provide the basic principles and guidelines for its implementation however it is not the intent of the city that the ordinance contain all of the detailed administrative procedures required for the daytoday operation of the program instead the city desires that city officials responsible for the cms possess a certain degree of flexibility and latitude to develop and employ such additional procedures forms etc as they deem necessary for carrying out an effective and efficient concurrency management system the city manager may develop as an administrative policy a concurrency manual or guide to assist city officials in the daytoday administration of the program  such a document would provide more detail than the ordinance concerning administrative procedures it is not the intent of the city that the concurrency management system in any of its aspects including concurrency evaluation and the issuance of concurrency compliance determinations replace any other development review criteria used by the city unless those criteria are inconsistent with the provisions of the concurrency management ordinance the cms is designed to primarily complement and not to replace the other review criteria c basic principles 1 the cms will formally take effect on the date specified in the adopting ordinance 2 each year in september the city shall verify by capacity reservation certifications from the following provider entities for the public facilities indicated city of daytona beachpotable water and sanitary sewer  volusia countysolid waste these statements shall cover at least the fiscal year starting october 1 and the fiveyear period starting with that fiscal year 3 each year in september the city shall issue its own capacity reservation certifications to cover the succeeding fiscal year and the following four fiscal years a total of five fiscal years for the following public facilities roadways parks and recreation 4 each year in september the city shall issue its own drainage certification to cover the succeeding fiscal year and the following four fiscal years a total of five fiscal years to cover onsite drainage facilities 5 concurrency review for a specific project will begin at the time of application for development approval a determination of concurrency will be made at the time the application is submitted once capacity has been determined to be available this capacity will be reserved and ultimately a capacity award will be made based on the table 1 presented in  for each development application a concurrency compliance review form ccrf shall be completed processed and filed see figure 4 7 the concurrency compliance review form establishes the service capacity reserved for that project this capacity is reserved for the time period shown on the following chart when a final development order is issued this reservation shall be awarded issuance of a concurrency compliance certification this certification shall remain valid for the time period shown on the following chart if a capacity reservation cannot be made for one or more critical facilities a concurrency compliance certification shall not be issued for the project for those projects requiring several approvals the reservation of capacity may occur at a different time than the final award of capacity table 1 south daytona development capacity management process capacity reservation reservation expiration capacity award capacity expiration building permit approval by cbo 2 months issuance and delivery 6 months subdivision approval ldrb concept plat approval 12 months city council final plat approval 24 months site plan approval drc review 6 months drc approval 12 months 8 impacts of phased projects shall be evaluated based on the phased development schedule capacity reservations and approvals may only be given for those phases occurring within the capital facilities horizon and capacity awards may only be given as set forth in above d criteria for concurrency evaluation of public facilities the following criteria will be used in conjunction with the concurrency compliance review form to evaluate the impact of proposed projects on public facilities it should be noted however that for selected public facilitiesie potable water sanitary sewer and solid wasteoverall citywide demand needed capacity will be calculated based upon population estimates and projections generated annually by the bureau of economic and business research of the university of florida bebr this calculation will be done once per year in september by multiplying the given population level for a particular target year by the adopted levelofservice standard a per capita figure  then the citywide demand will be compared with the reserved capacity allocated by the provider for the period in question  if the citywide demand is less than the available capacity there shall be no adverse impact on the lossie there shall be no concurrency problem or deficiency even in these cases however projectbyproject impact shall be calculated evaluated recorded and tracked to assure that the actual cumulative demandimpact does not exceed the available capacity for any relevant time period  the use of the ccrf form is essential for this process 1 roadway facilities a roadway capacity will be evaluated using the florida highway system plan levelofservice standards and guidelines issued by fdot and effective jan 1 1989 and as subsequently modified traffic modeling when required shall use the fsutms model b properties serviced by local roadways located within a recorded subdivision plat will be evaluated for impact at the nearest point of ingressegress to the roadway network c the impact on the roadway system will be determined by using the tripgeneration standards contained in the volusia county impact fee ordinance #866 as amended the estimated trips generated by the proposed project will be subtracted cumulatively from the available capacity on the roadway to determine whether roadway capacity is adequate to support the project based upon the resultant los in comparison with the citys adopted loss for the roadway in question d if no official traffic count exists for a collector or arterial the city will provide the count within a reasonable period unless it is arranged for by the applicant if the city provides the count the cost may be passed on to the applicant e calculation of total traffic to be generated by a proposed project will assume 100 percent buildout and occupancy credits against the trips generated by nonresidential land uses will be applied using the percentages employed by the volusia county impact fee system any claimed credit for capture of trips from passing traffic in excess of these percentages must be justified by the applicant any claimed credit for internal absorption of trips for a mixeduse development must also be justified by the applicant f proposed development which generates 100 or fewer average daily trips shall not be subject to an individual concurrency certification trips generated by projects below the threshold level shall be recorded and applied to the traffic circulation network as part of the annual certification process g proposed development which generates 500 or more average daily trips shall submit a traffic impact analysis at the time an application for development approval is filed this traffic analysis shall at a minimum include an analysis generated by the vcog traffic analysis system h evaluation of the impact of proposed development upon roadway levelsofservice must take into consideration both the relative impact from adjoining jurisdictions and the relative responsibility of various jurisdictions to provide for improvements this is particularly true for the following state roads nova road beville road and ridgewood avenue us highway 1 over which the fdot has primary jurisdiction and responsibility for financing needed improvements to the extent that planned improvements are behind schedule on these roadways due to no fault of the city nova road is a notable case in point the city should not be unduly and unfairly restricted from approving a limited amount of development so long as it does not substantially degrade the existing level ofservice additional traffic permitted on backlogged facilities will be governed by the level of services limits set by policy 18 of the adopted traffic circulation element of the south daytona comprehensive plan i levelsofservice on local roadways within the city shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a levelof service below the adopted c levelofservice standard for all local roadways j in augustseptember of each year the city will discuss and coordinate roadway levelofservice issues with those entities either having primary responsibility for the roadways or directly affected by them ie volusia county fdot local mpo daytona beach port orange and daytona beach shores k in september of each year after coordinating with affected entities the city will issue a roadway capacity reservation certification to cover both the following fiscal year and every succeeding year of the fiveyear period which begins with that initial fiscal year this certification will indicate the specific capacity levels which will be allowed for each roadway within the city limits plus beville road 2 potable water facilities in september of each year the city will obtain a potable water capacity reservation certification from the city of daytona beach this certification will cover at least the following fiscal year and the fiveyear period which starts with that fiscal year it will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city demand in gallons per capita ie the citys adopted levelofservice standard for potable water facilities the impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that point in time by the projected demand per capita ie the citys adopted levelofservice standard for potable water facilities  then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects and the cumulative total will be compared to the potable water capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project in addition all projects must be reviewed as to the adequacy of water pressure and water storage capacity according to the citys adopted levelofservice standards for those parameters 3 sanitary sewer facilities in september of each year the city will obtain a sanitary sewer capacity reservation certification from the city of daytona beach this certification will cover at least the following fiscal year and the fiveyear period which starts with that fiscal year it will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city flow in gallons per capita ie the citys adopted levelofservice standard for sanitary sewer facilities the impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that point in time by the projected flow per capita ie the citys adopted levelof service standard for sanitary sewer facilities  then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects and the cumulative total will be compared to the sanitary sewer capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project 4 solid waste facilities in september of each year the city will obtain a solid waste capacity reservation certification from volusia county this certification will cover at least both the following fiscal year and the fiveyear period which starts with that fiscal year it will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city disposal in pounds per capita ie the citys adopted levelofservice standard for solid waste facilities the impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that a point in time by the projected disposal per capita ie the citys adopted levelofservice standard for solid waste facilities then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects and the cumulative total will be compared to the solid waste capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project 5 drainage facilities in september of each year the city will issue its own one and fiveyear drainage facility adequacy certification which will state that concurrency compliance is assumed based upon the citys enforcement of its adopted levelofservice standard for onsite drainage 6 park and recreation facilities in september of each year the city will issue its own recreation capacity reservation certification this certification will cover at least both the following fiscal year and the fiveyear period on a yearbyyear basis which starts with that fiscal year it will be based upon the projected city population in 1000s for the periods in question multiplied by the citys adopted levelofservice standards units per 1000 for recreation facilities the impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project in 1000s at that point in time by the citys adopted levelofservice standards units per 1000 for recreation facilities  then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other projects proposed for the same fiscal year and the cumulative total will be compared to the recreation capacity reservation certification for the time period in question to determine capacity availability for the specific project e projected need for additional facilities to meet concurrency requirement 1 in the event that the citys concurrency analysis reveals that proposed or projected development will result in a concurrency deficiency in any one or more of the six types of critical public facilities for a particular fiscal year of project impact the city must make sure that there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to correct the deficiency before it makes a finding of concurrency compliance on specific affected projects this will require either the inclusion of timely remedial funding in the citys annual capital improvement programs budget developer commitment legally binding to provide remedial funding or some other legally binding obligation to correct the deficiency in a timely manner 2 in the event that a development order or permit should not otherwise be issued due to the unavailability of adequate funding for necessary public facilities the city will allow the developer to provide the facilities at his own expense contingent upon the public facilities to be provided must not be inconsistent with the schedule of capital improvements in the comprehensive plan  the city and the developer must execute an enforceable development agreement which includes a construction schedule and a monitoring mechanism and penalty clauses in case of noncompliance to ensure concurrency however mere availability of public facility capacity for a proposed project even if such availability is provided totally financing is not in itself sufficient justification for project approval  all of the citys project review criteria must be satisfied before the project can be approved 3 in the event that available facility capacity will be insufficient to serve all competing development applications impacting in a given fiscal year and being reviewed simultaneously the city will complete its review process and then prioritize the approval applications and it will approve them in rank order only to the extent that it is determined that concurrent capacity will be available approvable applications will be ranked on a first come first served basis by date of application in chronological order 4 in the event that a project is rejected either because capacity is unavailable for it or ranking procedure described in the preceding paragraph the city reserves the right to exercise the following options deny the project  or defer the project  or require project modification  or conditionally approve the project if the project is denied or deferred the applicant will be given the opportunity to leave his application on file or to resubmit it when facility capacity becomes available such applications will be given chronological priority over subsequent applications but must be reviewed for full concurrency compliance if more than 45 days elapse between denialdeferral and reconsideration f vested rights vested means that a property is not subject to concurrency requirements because it was approved on or before  the date of adoption of the citys comprehensive plan existing vacant residential commercial industrial and public buildings are considered vested vacant singlefamily building lots in platted and recorded subdivisions are considered vested this means that any homes built upon those lots are also vested other projects must have had an active building permit as of  to be considered vested g last resort provision as a last resort measure the city reserves the right to deny delay or conditionally approve any development application or permit which would otherwise be issuable if the project review process clearly demonstrates based upon convincing reasoning and documentation that approval would adversely impact the levelsof service of critical public facilities in such a way as to pose a clear threat to the health safety or welfare of the community h capacity reservation fee the city council may establish a capacity reservation fee in recognition of the value inherent in the reservation of service capacity for a specific development for a stated period of time the award of the capacity reservation prevents the city from awarding this same capacity to another project the specific fee will be established by resolution i no later than august or september of each fiscal year the concurrency manager will provide a report to the city council which evaluates the past performance of the cms and if needed makes recommendations for improvement this report may be combined with any other related report which must be issued during the same period j administration although the city council has the ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the cms various city agencies and officials carry out functions in the program the city manager as concurrency manager provides administrative oversight for the program however the community development directorchief building official will be responsible for the daytoday concurrency management decisions such as concurrency evaluations and the issuance of concurrency compliance certifications and building permits such agencies as the land development regulation board ldrb with respect to the comprehensive plan subdivision review and concurrency appeals and the board of adjustment with respect to other appeals will exercise their statutory functions in the administrative process k appeals 1 except as otherwise provided in the city appeals from concurrency determinations of city officials or agencies shall be taken before the land development regulation board ldrb any such appeal must be filed in writing with the community development director cdd within 20 calendar days of rendition of the decision in question and the reasons for such appeal shall be set forth therein the cdd shall arrange for an appeal hearing before the ldrb and shall notify the appellant in writing of the date time and place of the hearing 2 the appellant shall have the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that the decision of the city officials was in error said officials shall have the opportunity to present information and argument to support the citys decision 3 the board shall base its decision on the citys comprehensive plan and concurrency management regulations and it shall make its decision employing its usual voting procedures the decision shall be issued in writing stating the reasoning involved and it shall be rendered within 60 days of the close of the hearing 4 in the event that either the appellant or the concurrency manager wishes to appeal the matter further that may be done to the city council by filing a written appeal setting forth the reasons therefore with the city clerk within 20 calendar days after rendition of the decision by the board the city clerk shall arrange for a hearing before the city council and shall notify the appellant in writing of the date time and place of the hearing consideration shall be limited to the record established before the board and argument of the parties involved the city council shall base its decision on applicable laws and regulations it shall make its decision using its usual voting procedures the decision shall be issued in writing stating the reasoning involved and it shall be rendered within 60 days of the close of the hearing no further

transportation regulations b the city council is required to adopt this section in accordance with the provisions of fs   16 c the provisions of this section shall apply to all developments within the city of south daytona that impact a major roadway segment which has failed to achieve transportation concurrency by having a levelofservice below that adopted by the entity whether city county or state having competent jurisdiction d the provisions of this section shall not apply to developments of regional impact dris or to developments exempted from concurrency or to developments creating de minimis impacts ii purpose and intent the purpose and intent of this section is to establish a method for mitigating the impacts of development on transportation facilities cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors more specifically the proportionate fairshare mechanism is intended to enable developers to meet transportation concurrency requirements by paying their proportionate fair share of the cost of roadway improvements impacted by their proposed developments iii definitions for the purpose of this section the following terms shall be defined as follows unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning a capital improvements the outlay of capital of funds for the planning of engineering of acquisition of materials for acquisition of land for and

facilities fee the fee required to be paid by a developer in accordance with the terms of this section proportionate fairshare transportation regulations e land the earth water and air above below or on the surface which term includes any improvements or structures customarily regarded as land f land development activity generating traffic the conduct of any building activity or the making of any material change in the use of any land or structure that attracts or produces vehicular trips over and above those produced by the existing state of the land consequently placing an additional demand on the major roadway network g major roadway network all arterial and collector roadways within the city including any such proposed roads necessitated by new development activity generating vehicular traffic iv general requirements a a developer may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements 1 the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations  and 2 the fiveyear capital improvements schedule in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan includes a transportation capital improvement that upon completion will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development b the city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fairshare contribution to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development which improvement is not contained in the fiveyear capital improvements schedule and one of the following conditions applies 1 the city adds the improvement to the fiveyear capital improvements schedule no later than the next regular capital improvements schedule update of the comprehensive plan provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by fs   16b1  or 2 if the funds in the fiveyear capital improvements schedule are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement the city may enter into a proportionate fairshare agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of development upon which the proportionate fairshare amount is calculated if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the city council significantly benefit the impacted transportation system provided that said improvements are adopted into the fiveyear capital improvements schedule no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the comprehensive plan c any transportation capital improvement proposed to meet the developers proportionate fairshare obligation must meet the design standards of the city for citymaintained roads and the design standards of other applicable governmental entities for roads under their jurisdiction v application process a a developer who applies to commence any land development activity which would result in a failure of a road segment to meet transportation concurrency may apply to the city for a proportionate fairshare agreement b prior to submission of an application for a proportionate fairshare agreement a preapplication meeting shall be held with city staff to discuss eligibility application submittal requirements potential mitigation options and other relevant issues if the road segment that would fail to meet transportation concurrency is on the strategic intermodal system sis the florida dept of transportation fdot shall be requested to participate in the preapplication meeting  other directly affected jurisdictions may

information of the developer  b a survey and legal description of the land  c project schedule including phases if applicable  d description of the requested fairshare mitigation  e if the requested fairshare mitigation involves a road segment on the strategic intermodal system sis evidence of concurrence from fdot  and f traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to meet transportation concurrency 2 within 20 days of receipt of the application the community development director shall conduct his review of the application to determine its completeness if the application is not complete a written statement shall be sent to the developer delineating the deficiencies  if such deficiencies are not remedied by the developer within 30 days of receipt of the written notice then the application shall be deemed to be abandoned the community development director in his sole discretion may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies if the developer shows good cause and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure 3 if the community development director determines that the application is complete he shall provide written notification

share   development tripssv increase  cost where development trips   those trips from the development that are assigned to the affected roadway segment sv increase   service volume increase provided by the improvement to the affected roadway segment cost   adjusted cost of the improvement c for the purpose of determining proportionate fairshare obligations improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained as appropriate from the citys fiveyear capital improvements schedule the transportation improvement program of the volusia county mpo the road program of the county of volusia or the work program of fdot if information is not available from such sources the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods 1 an analysis by the community development department of costs adjusted by the fdot price trends index from the previous year by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects  or 2 the most recent issue of the fdot transportation costs as adjusted based upon the type of cross section  locally available data from recent projects as to acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events d if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section e if the city has accepted rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued as of the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the volusia county property appraiser or with mutual agreement of the city and the developer by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and not at city expense the developer shall supply to the city a certificate of title or title search of the land at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the developer is less than the cityestimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for the development then the developer must pay the difference vii transportation facilities impact fee credit a proportionate fairshare mitigation payments shall be applied as a credit against impact fees credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements upon which the proportionate fairshare contribution is calculated also if the proportionate fairshare contribution is based upon only a portion of the traffic generated by the development the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees upon which the proportionate fairshare contribution is based b at the time that the proportionate fairshare obligation is being determined the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development if the developers proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the total transportation facilities impact fee anticipated for the development the developer must pay the difference to the city viii proportionate fairshare agreements a if the developer fails to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fairshare agreement the agreement shall be considered null and void and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this section b payment of the proportionate fairshare contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable if the payment is submitted after one year from the date of execution of the agreement the proportionate fairshare cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based upon the best estimate of construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to these regulations and adjusted accordingly c developer improvements authorized herein involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond in a form approved by the city attorney d developer improvements authorized herein not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy whichever occurs first e any requested change to a development project subsequent to the issuance of a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent that the change would generate additional traffic f a developer may present the city with a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement however the application fee paid to the city shall be nonrefundable ix appropriation of fairshare revenues a all proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of improvements contained in the fiveyear capital improvements schedule or for use as might otherwise be established as per terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement b in the event that a
