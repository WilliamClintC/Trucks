stormwater management  it is referred to herein as this article    1 authority the town board of commissioners is authorized to adopt the ordinance from which this article is derived pursuant to state law including but not limited to article 14 section 5 of the constitution of north carolina  gs 1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder session law 2004163  chapter 160a  174 185    1 findings a it is hereby determined that 1 development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  2 these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and 3 these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites b further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the town to adopt minimum stormwater management controls such as those included in this article c therefore the board of commissioners establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge    1 purpose a general the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this article seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2 requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7 establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to ensure appropriate longterm maintenance    1 applicability and jurisdiction a general beginning with and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from
