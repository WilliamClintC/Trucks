are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is

finding of guilt be punished by a fine of up to one thousand dollars or sixty days imprisonment or both  adult entertainment purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate certain types of businesses including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments the city considered specific evidence of the undesirable secondary effects of sexually explicit businesses when it enacted the provisions of this chapter before adopting this provision the city considered and reviewed an extensive report prepared by the city of austin texas concerning adultoriented businesses in that city and considered the increased criminal activity around the adult entertainment establishments and the expenditure of additional funds for law enforcement to combat the criminal activity the city also reviewed studies prepared in garden grove california  seattle washington  and oklahoma city oklahoma however it is recognized that said regulation cannot amount to prohibition otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish as to adult dance establishments this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and property values regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions in the same manner establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol live commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct prostitution public solicitation public indecency drug use and drug trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior in this section described the mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well furthermore it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores peep shows adult theaters and adult massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities the mayor and council find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities in addition the experiences of other cities and counties with adult bookstores have shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter view videos depicting sexual activity and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths the mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses neighborhoods and of churches schools residential areas public parks and childrens day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments therefore the mayor and council find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment the mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests including but not limited to reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression to that end this chapter is adopted part 2003   definitions the following terms used in this chapter defining adult

hazard areas of auburn are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses were caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1  b 1992   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and

due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art 1  c 1992   objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and bridges located in floodplains  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g to insure that

part 2001   stormwater detention guideline a general 1 stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin produce peak flowrates and flow velocities at the sites boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for predeveloped conditions 2 the positive effects of stormwater management via onsite detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of distance increases and the smaller the facilitys contribution is as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized because of these limitations onsite detention is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest and only if the point of interest is immediately downstream the concepts of immediately downstream and significant percentage of total flow are inseparable the portion of a receiving watercourse one which receives and conveys runoff from a site which lies within a flow distance of onehalf mile two thousand six hundred forty linear feet downstream from the site shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is immediately downstream however the total flow in the receiving watercourse may become very large relative to the flow contributed by the project site within a much shorter distance for this reason the substantial percentage test must also always be applied for purposes of this title the flow from a site represents a significant percentage of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow rate from the site to the peak flowrate in the watercourse including the contribution from the project site is greater than five percent 3 peak flow rate control shall normally be provided only for the twoyear tenyear and twentyfiveyear frequency storm events however under certain conditions the one hundredyear event must also be detained to the predeveloped rate such control of the one hundredyear event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings property damage or public access andor utility interruption 4 for any stormwater analysis the composite c rational method or cn scs method used for analysis of predevelopment conditions shall not exceed 025 or sixty respectively unless prior approval has been obtained from the city a predesign conference between

100 100 100 commercial and industrial calculate on casebycase basis b dam design and construction criteria 1 detention facilities which take the form of normallydry basins ponds or lakes usually are created by damming a drainage way or watercourse such dams can take a variety of different forms the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls each type of dam has different characteristics and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by a professional engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site the purpose of the dam the type of impoundment safety and maintenance requirements 2 for purposes of this title dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities normallydry basins ponds and lakes a normallydry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event the vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass lakes and ponds on the other hand are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a moreorless permanent basis lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude the magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam the size of its contributing drainage area and the volume of water it is capable of impounding for purposes of this title a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than twenty feet a drainage area of less than one hundred acres and which is incapable of impounding more than ten acrefeet of water 3 all dam design is to be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the state of georgia 4 dams for normallydry detention basins shall conform to the following a dams for normallydry detention basins may be constructed of earth reinforced concrete mortared rubble or other suitable materials b the design of any concrete

top width of no less than eight feet and slopes on both faces no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical f for earthen dams for normallydry detention basins there shall be at least one and onehalf feet of vertical separation between the one hundredyear ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam one foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other six inches is to allow for settlement no separation is required for a nonearthen dam if it has been designed to overtop safely g more stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normallydry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe 5 dams for ponds shall conform to the following any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the georgia safe dams act georgia department of natural resources rules for dam safety

natural resources rules for dam safety publication and the usda soil conservation services technical release no 60 earth dams and reservoirs all design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications c detention facility outlet devices 1 because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition the design consultant is responsible for the selection of the device subject to the review and approval of the city 2 the city will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance longevity of the system freedom from congestion practicality and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device the consultant should be guided by the preference of vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most of the considerations expressed herein 3 no orifice shall be smaller than three inches in diameter an orifice smaller than fifteen inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack a trash rack protecting an orifice shall have surface area of at least ten square feet no opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than onehalf the size of the area

control design should seek to first prevent erosion from occurring  second trap sediments as close to their sources as possible and third provide a secondtier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site this backup defense will usually consist of check damsand or sediment basins 2 whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility 3 in unusual cases where a normallydry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics particularly volume will be maintained 4 the design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with appendix c of the manual for erosion and sediment control in georgia h ponds and lakes not used for detention in such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility the same general and specific criteria contained in this title shall apply but may be modified in instances where a specific requirement is clearly detention oriented rather than safetybased part 2001   culverts and pipe collection system guidelines a culverts 1 single barrel or single cell culvert structures are

removal may be prohibited if reasonable accommodations can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and such accommodations have not been made 3 the removal will have a significant adverse impact on property values of any adjoining property 4 specimen trees removed with prior approval from the city planner or designee must be replaced in addition to the minimum site density factor to compensate for their removal specimen trees must be replaced on an inchbyinch basis by species with the potential for comparable size and quality for example the removal of a thirtyinch dbh tree would require replacement of fifteen twoinch caliper trees of a comparable species this tree replacement is in addition to the minimum site density 5 any specimen tree removed without the appropriate review and approval of the city planner or designee must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to twice the unit values of the tree removed size alone will determine whether a

synonymous with tree the density requirement must be met as a condition of development permit issuance whether or not a property contained trees prior to development this density may be achieved for preserving existing trees by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this section or combination of both a the following formula shall apply to site density factor sdf analysis sdf   edf + rdf sdf is the minimum tree density to be achieved and maintained on all developed sites 100 units per acre edf existing density factor is the density value or credit of existing trees to be preserved on a site rdf replacement density factor is the density value of new trees to be planted on a site b the following steps are used to calculate the required tree preservation or replacement density step 1 calculate the site density factor sdf sdf is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 100 example a 25acre site has an sdf of 25  100   250 step 2 calculate the existing density factor edf edf is determined by converting the diameter of individual trees to site density units as indicated in table 1 these units are then totaled to determine the site edf example seven trees will remain on the 25acre site this includes four 6inch trees two 7inch trees and one 8inch tree the following site density units are associated with the trees to be preserved the total site density units 98 is the existing density factor edf table inset number of trees size class density units site density 4 6inch 12 48 2 7inch 15 30 1 8inch 20 20 total 98 step 3 calculate the replacement density factor rdf rdf is determined by subtracting the edf from the sdf example 250 sdf  98 edf   152 rdf this indicates that 152 tree density units are required on this site as replacements conform to the site density factor requirement of 100 units per acre step 4 calculate a sample plan for achieving the required replacement density factor rdf example plant eight 212inch

reservation of 25 percent of the total area of each development site as open space this is the atlanta regional commission minimum standard for impervious ratios in groundwater recharge areas it is accepted here as a reasonable standard for minimizing flooding potential and preserving the citys tree canopy for a oneacre lot this represents an area of 10890 square feet the city zoning ordinance requirement for landscaped areas is one tree per 250 square feet the minimum planting size is 212 caliper this results in 4356 trees for the 10890 square foot area accordingly a total of 40 trees in the 212size class is the basis of the tree diameter conversion for replacement trees as the ordinance favors preservation of existing trees the density credits are substantially skewed in favor of

protect the subsurface water resource of the city and surrounding communities that rely on it as sources of public water groundwater resources are contained within groundwater recharge areas which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface these groundwater recharge areas are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface b groundwaters are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas it is therefore necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized c the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect the groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas  2 protect the groundwater by limiting density of development  and 3 protect the groundwater by ensuring that the development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality part 2004   establishment of a groundwater recharge area district a groundwater recharge area district is established which shall correspond to all lands within the city that are

fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soils limitations in their natural state wetlands serve man and nature they provide habitat areas for fish wildlife and vegetation  water control  erosion control  natural resource education  scientific study  open space  and recreational opportunities the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the state of georgia the georgia department of natural resources and the georgia department of community affairs have determined that

original ordinance designations have been maintained in the history notes following each section   findings the city of auburn mayor and city council make the following findings of fact a the city of auburn georgia hereinafter the city or auburn is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraphs i and iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city b in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the governing authority of auburn hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services c in promulgating the regulations contained in this section auburn is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the state of georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal d improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within the citys service area e a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the citys service area and surrounding areas f the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the citys service area in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs g failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the public sanitary sewer system and private septic systems thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into those systems h failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area water bodies i the city is required under federal and state regulations ie the federal clean water act the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system hereinafter npdes phase ii stormwater permit to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and stormwater conveyance system into state of georgia or united states waters therefore it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 and stormwater conveyance system whether the property is private or public in nature j compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes phase ii stormwater permit metropolitan north georgia water planning district and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for water quality management drainage system maintenance flood control and other program activities k the cost of operating and maintaining the citys stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system l the professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy m given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities within the citys service area in concert with other water resource management programs n stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the citys service area while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the citys service area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community o the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways p the stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof q a stormwater management program hereinafter swmp provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the citys service area and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the citys service area user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms r the area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge s a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the citys service area such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council t it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services systems or facilities together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes  9210   definitions
