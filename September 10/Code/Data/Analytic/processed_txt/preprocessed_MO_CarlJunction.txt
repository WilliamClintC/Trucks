hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from food damages a the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for jasper county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood ordinance of purpose  of reducing flood losses  3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base
