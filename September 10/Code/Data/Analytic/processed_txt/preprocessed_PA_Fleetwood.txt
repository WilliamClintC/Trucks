architectural overlay district regulations and other definitions of the zoning those regulations set forth in this govern the development and redevelopment within the architectural overlay district design criteria a materials 1 exterior painting metals and masonry all buildings within the architectural overlay district should be restored to the original architectural period if appropriate modifications which use color details and architectural motifs from other eras should be avoided cosmetic facelifts which cover andor obliterate the original architectural character of a faade should be avoided the original materials used for wall facings and ornamentation such as brick sheet metal cast iron and the colors themselves give buildings special character and identity the materials actually provide visual harmony to the entire streetscape and downtown atmosphere covering original material and details of just one building with inappropriate substitutes like aluminum or vinyl siding and stucco destroys the architectural character and identity of the entire commercial district repair and proper maintenance of original exterior surfaces and decorative features is the best solution to the problem of a deteriorating faade by taking advantage of the quality of the original materials and design the life of a building will be indefinitely prolonged and its commercial value increased a brickwork  masonry the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following i when cleaning or removing paint from buildings that are made of brick or masonry use steam or low pressure water no more than 300psi ii never sandblast or use abrasives on brick brick is one of the least costly materials to maintain iii to preserve its original beauty and prolong its life only periodic cleaning and repointing are required repoint brick and masonry facades when required repointing is the process of removing deteriorated mortar from the joints of a wall and replacing it with new mortar repointing is required when weather and the elements have worn away the mortar or when the mortar is so old that it begins to break apart and crumble from between the building blocks properly done repointing restores the visual and physical integrity of brick and masonry when repointing match new mortar to the original compressive strength color composition depth and finishing of the original joints failure to match mortar may be harmful to the composition of the building 26 if brick is already painted it may be cleaned with a chemical paint remover but a test should be performed to prevent brick damage brick used in some older buildings was fired from inferior clay and was meant to be protected in this case match the original paint color that was used to protect the surface  otherwise painting brick is not recommended or encouraged repair decorative brickwork and masonry whenever possible only replace decorative masonry features when they are completely missing or too deteriorated to repair use existing physical evidence to guide the new work and match the original features as closely as possible b wood the architectural overly district encourages and recommends the following i all wood structures and wood trim should be prepared for painting by manually scraping old paint to reveal the original architectural details ii wood should not be cleaned by sandblasting or by using pressurized water or steam iii in areas where wood is beyond repair appropriate carpentry is available professional milling of architectural elements or composite reproductions are available iv wood details should not be covered over with cladding which hides the original milled wood work c metals 1 sheet metal the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following i clean all sheet metal using chemical paint remover ii never sandblast or use abrasives on sheet metal iii repair or replace damaged areas with sections duplicated by a commercial sheet metal shop iv automobile fiberglass compounds can be used to fill and patch small voids and dented areas v properly prime and paint sheet metal with oilbased paint to prevent rusting 2 cast iron the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following i use wire brushes and steel wool to remove loose or deteriorating paint and rust chemical paint removers should not be used on cast iron 27 ii heat or low pressure sandblasting may be used to remove paint from cast iron iii missing cast iron parts can be recast in aluminum fiberglass or reinforced gypsum polymer cements iv properly prime and paint cast iron with rust inhibitive paint made for use on exterior metal surfaces v a powder coating may be applied to entire architectural pieces for longer term rust prevention d painting and color palettes the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following i white paint is a reversible treatment paint colors should nonetheless be chosen from those colors which are appropriate to the period of the building and should be applied to architectural features in a period appropriate fashion ii the placement and quantity of accent colors and the relationship of lights to darks should be in keeping with the character of the building iii use historically accurate color palettes local paint suppliers or the architectural overlay district resource library can help you select colors from the historical collections iv for most of fleetwoods buildings use colors from the period between 1880 and 1930 avoid large areas of stark bright white as such color is often not historically accurate and shows dirt faster than most colors in many cases the original colors used on any building can be determined with minimum effort in the process of scraping old paint one should be able to uncover the original coat of paint and match it to samples provided by local paint suppliers however discretion is allowed depending on choices made by original owners e stucco the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following i repair stucco faades by removing only the damaged material and patching with new stucco ii duplicate the strength composition color and texture of the original stucco surface 28 architectural elements and details this section outlines the uses and appropriateness of architectural designs and features that give personality to existing and new buildings and outdoor spaces a windows and doors 1 store front entrance ways the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the

style f when appropriate to the design of a building shutters should be provided on all windows 29 g proper hardware should be used for the installation of shutters h air conditioning vents are discouraged in all windows facing streets b site and building enhancements the design and use of sidewalks fences landscaped areas and lamp posts can dramatically affect the attractiveness of the

impressions welldesigned and implemented site and building enhancements add value to properties 1 paving and sitescaping the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following a quality paving materials should be used on sidewalks pedestrian walkways pathways plazas and courtyards the materials should be appropriate for the proposed pedestrian function and circulation requirements of such areas b the materials and design should enhance the overall site and be consistent with the building itself c avoid using asphalt for pedestrian walk or pathways d all areas of a site not occupied by buildings parking facilities or other improvements should be landscaped with trees shrubs hedges perennial gardens or ground cover e plantings should be designed in a manner that is complimentary to the surrounding property and buildings f tree guidelines both selection of trees and planting are on file in the fleetwood borough office and are incorporated herein by reference 2

selecting lighting fixtures use minimum wattage metal halide or high pressure sodium light sources low pressure sodium and mercury vapor light sources are discouraged b select decorative lamp posts that conform to downtown fleetwoods lighting standards their design should be appropriate to the overall character of the downtown district c lamp posts are especially recommended along faade sidewalks near gateways and side entrance corridors d parking area light stands and decorative lamp posts should not exceed twelve 12 feet in overall height c signs and awnings signs are as important today as they were long ago signs have a dramatic impact on the overall image of the borough the effect of signage on passersby whether they are current or potential customers can leave a great impression signs and awnings that are simple suitably sized attractively designed constructed of appropriate materials and properly located will favorably enhance the image of a business and the overall downtown 1 sign types the following are recommended sign types with definitions a flush signs are generally meant to be viewed from a distance these signs are visible when one is directly facing a structures facade or from across the street ideally flush signs should be placed on vacant panels above doors and display windows b projecting signs are primarily meant to attract the attention of pedestrians because they hang over the sidewalk projecting signs are most effective when used on buildings which abut a sidewalk c freestanding signs are appropriate when a structure is set back ten or more feet from the sidewalk freestanding signs alert people that a business exists when the structure may be partially hidden from pedestrian or vehicular traffic d window signs are applied on the inside of display windows or doors generally the viewer would need to be relatively close to the sign for legibility but that depends on the overall size of the window 2 sign basics the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following a use display windows for creative signage b locate signs and awnings in such a way that avoids completely covering or overwhelming architectural details such as cornices trim windows decorative brickwork or other unique architectural features c the orientation of signs should be geared to sidewalk pedestrians and to vehicular traffic 31 d signs should not be so detailed as to be unreadable by vehicular traffic e avoid extraneous information on signs and scale them to attract the attention of vehicular traffic f limit the quantity of signs on storefront display windows and doors signs should be sized and scaled to balance not hide or overwhelm the structure g neon internally lit plastic signs or flashing lights are not recommended as they do not reflect the historic character of the borough unless the sign comes from the original period as such is original to the business h the size of signs must conform to the borough building codes call the boroughs officer for this information 3 sign construction and design the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following a return to or recreate period signage b utilize lettering fashionable to the period of the building this type of sign should become the main source of identification c sign materials and design should reflect the period of the building and the original design of the storefront additionally the colors of signs and awnings should compliment the overall color scheme of the buildings facade and the downtown streetscape d use artisancrafted signs and quality sign materials manufactured specifically by the sign industry e use graphic elements and details of the building and architectural motifs as part of the sign design when feasible f lettering should be kept to a minimum and likewise the message should be brief and to the point a logo shape andor illustration can be submitted or included to communicate the nature of the business g avoid using multiple signs when one sign will be sufficient thereby avoiding confusion and distraction however the following additional signs may be appropriate in a given situation i small secondary signs used for directional purposes are acceptable so long as they maintain the same design elements of the main identification sign ii freestanding sandwich signs that advertise daily specials or events are acceptable so long as they maintain the same design elements of the main identification sign 4 lighting signs the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following 32 a use external lighting fixtures rather than internally lit plastic fixtures b avoid using flashing lights of any kind c sign lighting should be directed to the sign itself and not used to light the surrounding area separate fixtures should be used for area lighting d lighting fixture designs if visible should be consistent across the facade and compliment the architectural period of the building e neon signs are not a good substitute for welllit welldesigned signs that reflect the boroughs historical character 5 awnings awnings are both functional and decorative they provide sun and climate thus added energy savings control for merchandise in display windows and shelter for pedestrian shoppers an added feature of awnings is that they bring the tremendous appeal of color and pattern not only to individual buildings but to the entire downtown streetscape both fixed position and retractable awnings are acceptable the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following a utilize awnings fashionable to the period of the building slopetype awnings are appropriate as opposed to a waterfalltype awning b awnings

long as they are appropriate to and maintain the architectural style of the facade d select weathertreated canvas or natural looking material when shopping for awnings metal and plastic awnings are not recommended e awnings should not be oversized and should fit within the storefront area and not cover architectural elements d new construction new construction should conform to the architectural styles scale and character of the existing surrounding properties and shall incorporate the objectives of these design guidelines 1 demolition demolition of existing structures should only be considered under the following conditions a if the building is beyond repair b if the building is not a significant structure or has lost all integrity of its historic character 33 c if over 50% of the structure has been destroyed by fire or disaster d if the structure is an unsound threat to public health that cannot be corrected or stabilized in a reasonable time frame architectural design this section outlines the uses and appropriateness of architectural designs and features that give existing and new buildings and outdoor spaces their personality a orientation of new buildings the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following 1 new buildings should face a street or other public space buildings should not front directly onto parking lots 2 new buildings situated on street corners should have two faades both walls do not need to provide their own entrance but the facade without a door should not be a blank canvas rather it should be an extension of the facade with the entranceits design should be integrated with the main wall of the building 3 off street parking areas should be sensitively located to the side or rear of the building this layout will reduce the visual impact to and disruption of the streetscapes continuity b scale and mass of additions and new buildings the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following 1 the overall scale massing and proportions of new additions buildings and new landscape should relate to and be compatible with those of adjacent and surrounding buildings changes in scale and mass such as offsetting a walls or deviating from the existing roof line should be made in graduated increments 2 buildings should not have long uninterrupted flat walls 3 designing wall offsets adding changes in floor levels including windows and ornamentation to exterior walls should be used to add interest and variety 4 roof line offsets gables and dormers should be utilized to vary the

the new roof form its shape should be appropriate to imitate the existing buildings roof profiles 2 in new additions the use of gables dormers masonry chimneys cupolas and similar elements is encouraged where appropriate to the design of the existing building 3 flat roofs should be avoided on one and two story buildings 4 the facade of a building should be emphasized patterns and proportions and the enhanced treatment of entrances materials and architectural motifs 5 the design of visible side and rear walls should be compatible with the facade the use of blank windowless walls is discouraged however if they are absolutely necessary they should utilize surface articulation and architectural elements found in other wall facings e service areas and mechanical equipment the architectural overlay district encourages and recommends the following 1 loading areas waste facilities air conditioning units exhaust and vent stacks elevator penthouses and antennae should be located to the rear of buildings or screened from view 2 the use of interior refuse rooms in lieu of outdoor dumpsters or other methods of waste removal is encouraged exterior refuse containers and
