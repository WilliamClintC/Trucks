resourceslands subject to flooding and adjoining upland areas 2 utilize the home rule authority of the town of greenfield for theprotection of wetland resource areas by prior public review 3 control activities likely to have a significant or cumulative effect upon jurisdictional areas as outlined in the massachusetts wetlands protection act mgl c 131  40 and 310 cmr 1000 b this chapter also provides additional local enforcement measures in conjunction with the massachusetts wetlands protection act it is also  the intention of this chapter unless otherwise stated that the jurisdiction authority exceptions exemption time periods application procedures definitions and enforcement standards of the wetlandsprotection act shall apply  4232 jurisdiction a except as permitted by the conservation commission hereafterreferred to as the commission no person shall commence to removefill dredge build upon degrade discharge into or otherwise alter the following resource areas any freshwater wetlands marshes wetmeadows bogs swamps vernal pools springs banks reservoirs lakesponds beaches and lands under water bodies  lands adjoining these resource areas out to a distance of 100 feet known as the buffer zone  rivers streams brooks and creeks whether perennial or intermittent lands adjoining these resource areas out to a distance of 200 feet known as the riverfront area  or lands subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater or surface water collectively the resource areas protected by this chapter said resource areas shall be protected whether or not they border surface waters b jurisdiction under this chapter shall be the same as in the massachusetts wetlands protection act mgl c 131  40 except as outlined below c in accordance with the massachusetts wetlands protection act and based upon local historical experience the commission has determined that the following provisions are necessary to address and clarify issuesparticular to greenfield and to protect the interests contained in themassachusetts wetlands protection act mgl c 131  40 each provision is followed by a brief explanation in italics of the intendedpurpose which is not binding 1 for activities within the jurisdiction a minimum of a twentyfivefoot no disturb zone shall be maintained or provided betweenresource areas and all altered areas the commission shall create a wider no disturb zone when deemed necessary to protect the resource area because of the environmental quality or the hydrology of the resource area the following are not subject to ano disturb zone a utility rightsofway  b emergency activities  c any work with limited project status  and d activities currently exempted from the requirements for theriverfront area under 310 cmr 10586  2 3 4 this provision serves to ensure protection from negativeimpacts during activities within a resource area and the longterm viability of a resource area the following activities are prohibited within the onehundredyearfloodplain if implemented after  a the outdoor storage of autos auto parts and associated materials and lawn equipment including but not limited tolawn mowers weed whackers snow blowers etc b solid waste landfills junkyards salvage yards dumps c the manufacture storage or disposal of hazardous toxic orradioactive wastes d the temporary or permanent storage or disposal of materialsused in snow and ice control including sand salt or otherdeicing chemicals e the outdoor storage or placement of storage tanks aboveor below ground for petroleum products or other hazardousmaterial f the storage dumping filling or disposal of earth yard wasteor other materials these restrictions serve to protect areas within the floodplain from potential sources of contamination from pollutantsvehicles and their accessories road salt sand oil gas storedin the floodplain will pollute surface water during flooding events as well as themselves becoming dangerous debris onehundredpercent compensatory storage shall be provided forall flood storage volume that will be lost as the result of a proposed project within the onehundredyear floodplain this provision clarifies that the commission considers all incremental reductions in flood storage capacity to be significant over time and therefore requires replacement at a  ratio wetlands crossings to provide access to otherwise unreachableupland areas may be allowed only if a the only buildable uplands available on the lot have no reasonable alternative means of access from any road whetherpublicly or privately owned b the crossing is designed to minimize to the greatest extentpossible any disruption of the wetland c the driveway length and design are the minimum length and width necessary to provide access to the proposed use  this provision clarifies the criteria for determining the appropriateness of proposed wetlands crossing the commission may request the applicant to utilize access overan adjacent parcel of land currently or formerly owned bythe applicant or in which the applicant has or can obtain an ownership interest  may impose conditions to protect thewetlands  or the commission may deny a permit for a wetlandcrossing if the above criteria have not been satisfactorily met 5 to prevent resource area loss the commission shall requireapplicants to avoid or minimize alteration wherever feasible  andwhere alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized to provide full mitigation the commission may require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation but only with specific plansprofessional design proper safeguards adequate security and professional monitoring and reporting that assures success replication shall only be allowed when a preponderance of theevidence demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commission that the hydrological and ecological value of the replicated wetlandwould be greater than that of the wetland to be replacedestimation of wetland value and guidelines for replication shall be based upon the guidelines for wetland replication as describedin the 2002 massachusetts inland wetland replication guidelines commonwealth of massachusetts guidance no brpdwm wetg022 the purpose of this provision is to provide clarification that thedestruction of wetlands shall only be considered as a last resort because replication does not in fact substitute for many wetlandsvalues proposed wetlands replications are at the discretion of thecommission based upon solid scientific reasoning and shall not be permitted simply based upon a proposed  replication ratio orthe highest and best use of a property based upon developmentpotential  4233 exemptions and exceptions a the applications and permits required by this chapter shall not

recommended bulk chip storage units utilizing air flow to partially remove water vapor from wood chip surfaces and to improve the caloric value of the feedstock is highly recommended owners should evaluate incorporating any technology utilizing passive evaporation from airflow such as solar hot air waste or byproduct heating or active heating such as fan blown air to partially predry chips an accumulator tank is recommended to prolong pump life g energy management system 1 the commercial biomass energy system must use an energy management system and optimize boiler operation to meet seasonal and diurnal heating needs of the particular buildings heat load the system design should use a strategy that optimizes the use of both the pellet or woodchip boiler and thermal storage and the temperature requirements of the heat distribution system by using a large enough thermal storage tank to help meet the peak demand and a properly sized boiler the call for heat may be met with a smaller boiler without the need for additional heat input from the existing oilfired boilers the hot water storage can be recharged during periods when there is little call for heat in the building which is several hours each day 2 all systems shall modulate to lower output andor shut down when the heating load decreases or has been satisfied 3 pellet boilers and wood chip boilers must use a multipass heat exchanger 4 containerized highefficiency biomass systems that offer substantial savings compared to boiler room renovations are encouraged but not required when containers are used the stack height must be sufficient to adequately disperse emissions from the immediate vicinity and prevent entrainment of exhaust gases and particles into the building air intakes steps should be taken to minimize thermal losses to nonheated spaces including but not limited to insulating the container that houses the boiler and insulating pipes between the container and buildings being served h integration of solar thermal the integration of solar thermal water heating technology is encouraged solar thermal integration reduces fuel consumption and can prolong the life of the biomass boiler a
