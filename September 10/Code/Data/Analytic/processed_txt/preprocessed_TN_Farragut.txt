would be adequate for a proposed development or that a traffic study is not warranted the town engineering staff may reduce the level of study required or waive the requirement b traffic impact study guidelines and procedures 1 these traffic impact study guidelines and procedures define when proposed rezoning site plans and preliminary plat requests warrant a detailed traffic study and what information should be included in it all applicants will be required to follow the town guidelines 2 the purpose of performing a traffic impact study as defined by the institute of traffic engineers ite is to a provide guidance for short term and long term planning of site access  b provide guidance for onsite circulation and the interface between onsite circulation and offsite traffic  c provide guidance for offsite improvements needed to permit the roadway system to function satisfactorily so as to accommodate site and nonsite traffic  d assist developers and land owners in making land use site planning decisions regarding traffic  e identify the contribution a particular development makes to roadway system traffic volumes  f provide a basis for estimating roadway improvement requirements attributable to a particular project  g assess the compatibility with local transportation plans  h enable staff to better evaluate zoning changes and development plans  and i allow appointed and elected officials to know implications of their voting decisions c scope of required traffic impact studies three levels of study have been identified based on the number of trips that a development is projected to generate in a 24hour period 1 level i studies require analysis of each access per engineering staff that the development has to an existing roadway access points to be analyzed include public and private roads joint permanent easements and private drives 2 level ii studies require analysis of each access that the development has to an existing roadway and to the first control point beyond those access points a control point is an intersection controlled by a traffic signal or stop sign on the existing roadway onto which the development has access for cases where a traffic control device does not exist engineering staff will determine the extent of the study if a freeway interchange is near the property to be developed and is not signalized engineering staff will determine if the ramps need to be included in the study this level of study is commonly required for larger residential subdivisions commercial developments and office complexes 3 level iii studies require a complete traffic impact study this study must address each access point the first control point beyond each access point and the nearest collector intersection or street of higher classification or as determined by the engineering staff the exact area to be studied will be determined by the engineering staff with input from the study preparer level iii studies are uncommon as they are usually warranted only with very large mixeduse and commercial developments d submission and review procedures for traffic impact studies 1 applicants should conduct a preliminary trip generation assessment of any proposed rezoning site plan or preliminary plat request to determine if a traffic impact study will be required this preliminary assessment should be conducted well in advance of the actual submission of plans 2 if the preliminary assessment indicates that a traffic impact study will be required the applicant should consult as early as possible in the plandevelopment process with the towns engineering staff to verify a developments projected trip generation and to confirm whether or not a study will be required if a study is required the required level can be determined at that time 3 the applicant shall then select a licensed traffic or transportation engineer to prepare the study who may need to consult with the engineering staff periodically to review the collected data and any assumptions made in the draft report 4 four copies of the completed draft traffic impact study shall be submitted along with the development application and all other materials required for submission 5 the engineering staff shall review the draft traffic impact study in conjunction with the other elements of the development application if the draft traffic impact study is not of the proper scope or is executed improperly the applicant shall be notified of the deficiencies and be required to submit corrections on the same schedule that applies to the other elements of the development application failure to submit corrections in a timely manner may lead to a postponement of the application until the next regularly scheduled planning commission meeting since a completed traffic impact study must be submitted at the same time as the application for a development it is critical that the applicant conduct steps one early in their planning of a proposed development failure to submit a traffic impact study or submission of an inadequate study is likely to slow the review process and may lead to postponements e required qualifications for preparers of traffic impact studies traffic impact studies shall be prepared under the supervision of a qualified engineer who has specific training in traffic and transportation engineering and experience related to preparing traffic studies for existing or proposed developments the study shall be signed and sealed by the supervising engineer the ability to forecast and

waterways from surrounding upland activities aquatic buffers protect such integrity in the following ways 1 filtering excess amounts of sediment organic material nutrients and other chemicals  2 providing flood protection  3 reducing stormwater runoff velocities  4 protecting channel bank areas from scour and erosion  5 providing shade for cooling adjacent water which allows waters to hold a great level of dissolved oxygen  and 6 providing leaf litter and large woody debris important to aquatic organisms b aquatic buffers are most effective when stormwater runoff is flowing into and buffer as shallow sheet flow rather than in a concentrated form therefore it is critical that the design of any development include best management practices to the maximum extent practical that will result in stormwater runoff flowing into and aquatic buffer as shallow sheet flow    applicability this chapter shall apply to all new developments modifications to existing developments andor

public elements of street furniture shall have design coordination and require low maintenance    10252007 signs signs shall not be required to have a uniformity of appearance the most important issue in sign design in the tcd district is how an individual sign relates to the building on which it is placed 1 the following signs are permitted for each first ground story tenant space a general occupant sign any number of wall signs per entrance to the premises not to exceed a cumulative total of six square feet in size and eight feet in height  b one address sign per building entrance not to exceed two square feet  c temporary window signs not to exceed 25 percent of total window area or ten square feet whichever is less  d real estate sign one sign provided it is posted within the window and does not exceed six square feet  e perpendicular wall sign one sign which shall be hung perpendicular to the building shall not exceed nine square feet and shall maintain a clearance of nine feet to grade  f wall sign one sign not to exceed a ratio of 075 square feet per linear feet of exterior tenant space on which the sign is to be mounted provided it is integrated with the building architecture  g permanent window sign allowed only if no wall sign is used one sign which shall not exceed 12 square feet or 25 percent of the total window area whichever is less sign shall be permanently adhered to the window  h architectural design and illumination architectural design and illumination shall be in compliance with the towns adopted architectural design standards for signs in the town center 2 the following signs are permitted for each second third and fourth story tenant space a address sign one address sign per building entrance not to exceed two square feet if

buildings shall be firesprinklered in accordance with adopted fire and building codes and be of noncombustible construction    10252007 building facades all buildings shall consist of the traditional facade which includes the building cornice the upper facade and the storefront the building cornice serves to visually cap the building completing its appearance the upper facade always contains regularly spaced window openings surrounded by decorative details the storefront shall be designed to be as transparent as possible this allows a maximum of natural light and relieves the closedin feeling it also gives the potential customer a good view into the store diagram 1 1 the building cornice the building cornice is made of brick wood metal or other materials and gives a building roof line a finished look the cornice prevents the upper facade from falling off into the air the decorative cornice provides the cap to the building flat cornices shall not be permitted 2 the upper facade the upper facade includes all upper stories each story shall contain regularly spaced window openings surrounded by decorative details 3 the storefront a minimum of 75 percent of the street facing building facade between two feet and eight feet in height shall be comprised of clear windows that allow views of indoor space or product display areas the bottom edge of any window or product display window used to satisfy the transparency standard shall not be more than three feet above the adjacent sidewalk the product display windows used to satisfy these requirements shall have a minimum

surrounded by enframing piers and storefront cornice transom windows display windows to emphasize the feeling of containment a storefront might be set back slightly six inches to a foot from the front of the building to welcome customers consider a recessed entry the configuration keeps the display windows close to the sidewalk and emphasizes the door storefronts associated with tenant spaces located at building corners are required to meet this on only one street facing facade the street facing building facade that does not have the storefront must provide windows or some other type architectural feature so the wall is not blank diagram 2 4 doors and entrances each different building facade shall have a primary entrance door facing a public sidewalk entrances at building corners may be used to satisfy this requirement building entrances may include doors to individual shops or businesses lobby entrances entrances to pedestrianoriented plazas or courtyard entrances to a

surrounding facades the same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole the roof forms and colors shall create a rhythmic harmony in appearance this does not mean to imply all are to be the same but that all are to flow and follow the ten basic criteria that should be considered in the overall design of the development height width relationship to the street roof forms proportion composition rhythm proportion of openings materials and colors diagrams 3 4 and 5 1 height buildingsfacades should have similar height a fourstory building should not be located immediately adjacent to a much shorter twostory building the height variations should flow up and down gradually without drastic drop offs at the same time there should be varying heights the same height for the entire block length appears contrived and sterile 2 width facade widths should not vary drastically a narrow facade should not be sandwiched between two much wider facades and a wide facade should not be sandwiched between two much narrower facades the width variations should flow up and down 3 relationship to street the buildingsfacades should have consistent setbacks with that of its neighboring buildingsfacades a buildingfacade recessed to the maximum setback should not be located in the middle of a row of buildingsfacades located at the minimum setback 4 roof forms the form of the roof and building cornice should be similar to those on adjacent facades 5 proportion the characteristic proportion the relationship between height and width should be respected the block should look proportional not disjointed 6 composition the composition for the buildingsfacades ie the organization of its parts should be similar to that of surrounding buildingfacades 7 rhythm rhythms that carry throughout the block such as window spacing should be incorporated into the facades 8 proportion of openings the size and number of window and door openings should be similar to those on surrounding facades the same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole 9 materials facades should be composed of materials that complement adjacent facades individual facades should not stand out against others 10 colors the colors of the buildingsfacades should tie in to its neighbors    10252007 secs 1072910759  reserved article 3  sinkholes footnotes

its citizenry  1 1192017 need certain areas of the town and surrounding areas drain exclusively or predominantly to sinkhole systems as such these sinkhole systems must remain available for the temporary storage and drainage of surface runoff in a manner similar to established riparian floodways and floodplains sinkhole areas are also known to be unstable for construction and drainage structures placed on soil foundations in sinkhole areas may be subject to flooding settling or collapse it is not possible to determine a generalized rule for sinkhole capacity each sinkhole behaves differently from all other sinkholes and the discharge from each is a function of unknown subterranean stream configurations sinkholes must not be used as an integral part of the drainage system unless no other outlet is feasible as shown in a study by a licensed engineer with expertise in hydrology and approved by the town engineer sinkholes are known to be part of fragile drainage systems

identified sinkholes should be avoided by design and separated from construction activities except as provided for in this article sinkhole  the limited filling of sinkholes may be permitted by the town upon a finding that a the avoidance of a sinkhole is clearly not possible given existing conditions for example when widening an existing collector or arterial street the towns staff may seek additional review and approval from the planning commission and the stormwater advisory committee whenever they determine that the circumstances warrant b a sinkhole is identified during or after approved site construction activities the town determines that it was not reasonably identifiable prior to construction using standard practices and development activities have progressed to the point that redesigning to avoid filling the sinkhole is shown to be impracticable and fully documented by the developer the towns staff may seek additional review and approval from the planning commission and the stormwater advisory committee whenever they determine that the circumstances warrant c the planning commission has determined that such fill and construction is appropriate to advance a competing and adopted public policy plan or ordinance  is related and proportional to the public interests involved  and avoidance of the sinkhole is not reasonable given the specifics of the site and surrounding area for example the planning commission may permit the limited filling of a sinkhole area to facilitate the construction of a critical walkway extension to further the towns adopted

building construction in sinkhole areas and sinkhole drainage areas  sinkhole areas are known to be unstable for construction structures placed on soil foundations in sinkhole areas may be subject to both settling and collapse of the sinkhole uncontrolled fill placement may present additional settlement hazards mitigation of these possible undesirable consequences shall at a minimum be addressed as follows all buildings shall be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the sinkhole lip elevation unless at the time of sinkhole identification and determination during the platting or site planning process the farragut municipal planning commission finds a that the applicant provides sufficient and proper evidence for the farragut municipal planning commission to determine that there is no danger other than that which would normally be encountered in the construction of a similar building in other areas  b that the drainage function of the sinkhole will not be compromised by the construction within said 50 foot line  c that there will be no hazard to groundwater  and d that the applicant has obtained all necessary permits necessary from the tennessee department of environment and conservation as part of the evaluation involving a thru d above the planning commission may require the submittal of all necessary engineering and scientific studies to document any findings or

adopted in october 1987 and revised february 2006 amendments are indicated in parenthetical history notes following amended provisions the absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation for stylistic purposes headings and catchlines have been made uniform and expression of numbers in text as appears in the ordinances has been used a consistent scheme of capitalization has also been used additions for clarity are indicated by brackets state law reference subdivision regulations tca  134301 et seq answers to questions often asked about subdivision regulations answers to questions often asked about subdivision regulations 1 are subdivision regulations fair to everyone yes the written regulations provide the municipal planning commission with uniform procedures standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plats for land subdivision 2 who is affected by the regulations every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels or changes the size or shape of existing lots 3 am i affected if i resubdivide my tracts into two parcels yes subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes resubdivision 4 whats to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval the county registrar of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivision lying within planning regions without final approval in writing 5 can i sell by an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds no state law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by law to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale 6 what happens if i sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision a a state law has been broken public acts of 1951 b some cloud would exist on the title of the lot c most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans d state law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers water mains lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads e where zoning is in effect a building permit to construct any building will be withheld f any building or structure erected in violation may be forced to be vacated or removed g the legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction or other legal action 7 what improvements will i need to install in my subdivision farragut subdivision regulations require the developer to grade and improve streets install storm drainage sewers and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications 8 why doesnt the lot buyer instead of the developer pay for improvements the lot buyer doesat the time he purchases his property if lots are sold before improvements are in the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements that should have been originally planned for and installed by the developer 9 wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of money quite the contrary properly planned subdivisions make the most of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a maximum number of wellarranged and easier sold lots good land subdivision affects the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor while saving the developer money 10 how do i go about having a subdivision approved the farragut planning commissions printed set of regulations includes the procedure for having a plat approved the planning commission meets at regular intervals and your plans are submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered it is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area 11 what if i wish to layout a commercial or industrial subdivision the provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivision of land including that for use of business and industry since space parking and service requirements will vary greatly it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses for that reason specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential areas 12 where can i get technical site planning assistance the planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision although they will not prepare final plans for you trained planners are available at the east tennessee office of the tennessee local planning assistance office in knoxville tennessee article i  purpose authority and jurisdiction a  purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is

regulations are established to provide for the minimum community open space needs of the residents of new subdivisions  to assure adequate maintenance of community open space and facilities to provide for attractive and stable residential areas to protect and enhance the natural resources and environment  and to implement the recreation element and other applicable elements of the comprehensive plan of the town of farragut b applicability the subsection shall apply to all developments subject to subdivision plat approval pursuant to these regulations c definition for the purpose of this section the following definition shall apply unless the context otherwise requires community open space means that open space that is designed and improved for recreational use andor open space that is designed or preserved to enhance the visual mental and physical enjoyment of the residents of a subdivision andor the community at large community open space may be located on or off the subdivision site but shall be reasonable accessible to all dwelling units therein land designated as community open space shall be suitable for active andor passive recreational use and may include playgrounds tot lots lakes greenbelts bikeways recreational club houses swimming pools tennis courts and similar facilities community open space shall not be deemed to include required minimum yards or other areas as required by these or other applicable regulations of the town including but not limited to permanent structures used for the storage or direction of water courses d required community open space 1 amount at least ten percent of the gross area of a subdivision or one developed lot whichever is greater shall be devoted to community open space in instances in which one developed lot would constitute more than 15 percent of the gross area of the subdivision the planning commission may make a determination that an area of less than one developed lot may serve to meet the intent of these regulations in those cases where the gross area of a subdivision is less than 50000 square feet community open space may not be required the planning commission may waive the required amount of community open space in situations of minor revisions to existing recorded subdivided lots or in cases where the proposed subdivision is completing the infill process and has no contiguous area available for additional incremental subdivision a dedication to the town the required community open space may be offered for dedication to the town b common ownership by a property owners organization the required community open space may be held in common ownership by a property owners organization under the following circumstances in instances where developers chose to make significant recreational improvements to the required community open space or post a performance bond in accordance with of these regulations and has established a property owners association in a form acceptable to the planning commission and town attorney c dedication and common ownership in certain instances the planning commission may determine that the community open space needs of the subdivision are best served by portions of such space being dedicated to the town with other portions of such space being held in common ownership by a property owners organization 2 composition of community open space the primary intent of requiring community open space to be included as part of a subdivision is to provide adequate space suitable for development as neighborhood park areas the planning commission recognizes however that a subdivision may have unique features in terms of age composition family size or unique environmental topographical and historic properties therefore the planning commission may determine that all or a portion of the required community open space may be devoted to areas other than those expressly suited for development as active park areas the following is a guide to be used by the planning commission in determining the extent to which areas other than those suitable for development as neighborhood park areas may be used in fulfilling the community open space requirement a greenbelt areas for such areas to be considered in fulfilling the requirement for community open space the areas must be at least 25 feet in width while no specifications are outlined for the composition in terms of existing or installed plant materials it must be clearly demonstrated that the goals of preserving community open space that will enhance visual mental and physical enjoyment will be achieved the area devoted to greenbelt areas shall be counted on a square foot for square foot basis toward fulfilling the community open space requirement

traffic control devices c landscaped entrances when more than 2000 square feet are devoted to identifying the entrance to a subdivision the area shall be counted on a square foot per square foot basis toward fulfilling the community open space requirement the maximum amount that can be counted toward fulfilling the community open space requirement shall be 4000 square feet for each entrance d boulevards and other street improvements street improvements such as boulevards medians and related additional rightsofway greater than that required by these or other regulations may be used toward fulfilling the community open space requirement the area in excess of that required may be counted toward the required community open space on a square foot for square foot basis e other areas in some instances subdivisions may contain certain unique natural or manmade features that may allow such areas to qualify as meeting the intent of these regulations in providing community open space in such cases the planning commission may consider such areas as counting toward fulfilling the community open space requirement and may determine the square footage which may be counted toward fulfilling this requirement 3 plans community open space areas proposed for dedication to the town andor to be held in common ownership by a property owners organization shall be indicated on the concept plan

easements are designed to provide access for such public improvements as street widening stormwater drainage the installation of sidewalks and water sewer telephone and cable lines etc these improvements may involve public and private utilities including cable companies the town of farragut and state and federal agencies coordination between each of these interests is imperative to ensure coordination the town of farragut maintains complete control of the drainage utility and construction easements therefore whether a publicprivate utility or state or federal agency any entity performing work within these drainage and utility easements must submit plans to the town of farragut and receive written approval of those plans prior to undertaking such work work may not begin without first obtaining town of farragut approval construction easements to be located along public rightsofway are for the sole use of the town of farragut and its agents 3 easements for signs to

flexibility in interpretation compliance with the intent of applicable guidelines is expected to the greatest extent feasible however not all guidelines will apply to every project guidelines that refer to features that are not part of a development or redevelopment project are not applicable flexibility in the application of some design guidelines may also be available for redevelopment minor projects or other projects as noted throughout the document where a project includes a new or innovative approach that is not addressed by the guidelines it may be necessary to use the intent statement for the topicsubtopic see  sic or the overall objectives for the design guidelines see  sic to determine whether the approach is appropriate in some cases the design guidelines may also be used to help interpret and illustrate design standards within the farragut zoning illustrated below the zoning design guidelines work together to ensure that development promotes community objectives 10  site design guidelines new construction and redevelopment in farragut should incorporate highquality site design to enhance community image and help create more pedestrianoriented spaces with a unique sense of place this chapter provides guidelines for the site design portion of a new construction improvement or redevelopment project including the street character arrangement of buildings open space pedestrian connections and landscaping it begins with case studies that illustrate how the guidelines combine to promote highquality site design in farragut followed by specific guidelines

guidelines in this chapter as applied to a site that is primarily designated as officelight industrial on farraguts future land use map it also meets the intent of the design guidelines for the outlet drive subarea on  sic this case study is provided to illustrate design guidelines principles and does not represent a specific development proposal the illustrated development provides space for office light industrial and other employment uses and incorporates highquality open space and lowimpact development principles for stormwater management sustainable design principles new construction and redevelopment throughout farragut should incorporate sustainable design principles whenever possible to reduce the environmental impacts of new development and provide cost savings several specific sustainability principles and features that relate to both site and building design are summarized below streetscape the streetscape includes the public and semipublic area between the edge of the street and parking areas or building frontage elements include sidewalks walking trails bump outs street trees and lawns street furniture and lighting streetscape features should be functional and durable while helping to affirm or establish the identity of a neighborhood district or development additional contextsensitive guidelines are provided in 1 integrate functional pedestrian improvements into the streetscape a provide unobstructed sidewalks at least five feet wide on public frontages surrounding a development and along internal streets and lanes b provide a wide walking path at least eight feet wide rather than a conventional sidewalk along collector or arterial streets surrounding a development whenever possible c provide a landscaped area or trees in grates between streets or parking areas and sidewalks or walking paths d see connectivity on  sic for additional guidelines related to the pedestrian network 12 coordinate streetscape elements along public frontages surrounding a development a coordinate streetscape elements with elements provided by the town such as street lights or other public improvements whenever possible see the interface between public streets and private development on  sic for more information b install decorative streetlights or other coordinated improvements where they are not provided as a public improvement see site lighting on  sic for more information c consider reserving space for future streetscape improvements rather than immediate installation to provide flexibility for redevelopment or minor projects 13 coordinate streetscape elements on internal streets and lanes within a development a coordinate streetscape improvements within a development with streetscape improvements on surrounding streets whenever possible b use decorative street lights and other street furnishings that help establish a sense of identity within the development see outdoor open space on  sic and site lighting on  sic for more information 14 use streetscape elements that invite a high level of activity along a commercial street frontage these include a street trees with grates located in paved pedestrian areas b benches and planters of finished highly durable materials c decorative paving such as scored concrete or unit pavers to define special areas 15 use streetscape elements that invite passive pedestrian and recreational activity along a residential street frontage these include a landscaped tree lawn areas between the sidewalk and the street b benches or other furnishings located in landscaped areas the interface between public streets and private development although the design guidelines primarily address the character of development on privatelyowned property it is important to understand the typical progression of spaces between buildings and an adjacent public street in many cases a new development will not be responsible for improvements within the public area between the property and the street however new development should have a strong relationship to public areas which may include incorporating amenities paths or other features in a semipublic interface area new development should also accommodate existing facilities or planned improvements in adjacent public areas the typical progression of public and private spaces along the street edge are illustrated below in a town center context building setbacks and frontage building setbacks address the distance between buildings and the street or sidewalk edge while building frontage relates to the alignment of buildings at the setback and whether parking or extensive landscape areas are located in setback areas whenever possible buildings should be aligned along the street to hide parking and promote active sidewalks a uniform alignment of buildings helps to define a street wall which provides a sense of enclosure and a comfortable scale for pedestrians additional contextsensitive guidelines for building frontages are provided in note that the farragut zoning reduced setbacks where parking areas are located behind buildings see farragut zoning requirements on  sic for additional information 16 design the street frontage to promote pedestrian activity appropriate strategies for a new development include a locating new buildings between the street and a parking area to minimize vehicular impacts on pedestrians b aligning new buildings along streets and lanes that are internal to a development c locating a new building to the side preferred or rear of a parking area to provide flexibility for a small project appropriate strategies for a redevelopment include d expanding buildings to extend closer to the street e improving pedestrian connections between buildings and the street see guideline 18 on  sic and guideline 139 on  sic for more information appropriate strategies for a redevelopment where existing buildings are located behind a surface parking lot include f locating new liner buildings between the street and a parking area g providing improved pedestrian connections surface parking area to the street when renovating an existing building 17 design the street frontage to be compatible with the surrounding context a provide a landscaped front setback area between buildings or parking areas and the street where development will be oriented primarily towards internal parking areas or where residential development with a landscaped setback is located across the street b align buildings near the sidewalk edge in the town center district or where development seeks to provide a more urban pedestrianoriented street edge see front setback alternatives through design review on  sic and town center subarea on  sic for more information community feedback on building frontages participants in meetings and workshops for the design guidelines noted that placing buildings to promote an attractive pedestrianfriendly streetscape was one of the most important design objectives for the guidelines to address farragut zoning requirements the farragut zoning setback requirements that address the placement of buildings in relation to the edges of a property side and rear setbacks ensure that building locations are compatible with surrounding properties while front setbacks address the relationship of buildings to the street and sidewalk as described below setback regulations vary by zone district in some cases a minimum front setback required by the farragut zoning be adjusted design review process where an alternative design would allow for a more active pedestrianoriented street frontage see town of farragut zoning  on  sic for more information on the relationship between zoning requirements and design guidelines connectivity connectivity refers to the network of sidewalks paths lanes and streets that provide pedestrian and vehicle routes within and between properties or neighborhoods a lack of connectivity and a focus on sitebysite development currently makes many parts of farragut unfriendly to pedestrians this is especially true for the towns commercial corridors making it difficult to walk between shops or to walk from residential neighborhoods to work shop dine or visit entertainment and recreation venues future development should help create a more active and interconnected environment throughout farragut initially individual sites will become more walkable with better connections between buildings sidewalks parking areas and buildings as additional sites redevelop a network of connections between sites and to adjacent neighborhoods should emerge see strategies for pedestrian connections on  sic for additional information and illustrations 18 provide pedestrian and bicycle connections into and between properties a create an internal circulation system that will link those of adjacent properties when feasible b provide a clearly defined direct connection to adjoining public sidewalks note that the farragut zoning sidewalk connections see sidewalk connection options on  sic for more information c provide midblock connections for pedestrians when possible d route pedestrian connections to and open spaces such as courtyards patios and plazas when possible e align sidewalks and pedestrian paths to link with potential future development phases f align sidewalks and pedestrian paths to potential future connections on adjoining properties 19 provide vehicular connections into and between adjoining properties a ensure that developments have more than one vehicular entranceexit b provide direct vehicular connections to streets and lanes on adjoining properties to reduce traffic and pedestrian impacts on surrounding streets c align internal drive aisles to allow for future connections to adjoining properties strategies for pedestrian connections future development should help create a more active and interconnected environment throughout farragut as illustrated below this may include midblock pedestrian connections and pedestrian connections that are routed to and open spaces such as courtyards patios and plazas outdoor open space outdoor space includes public and semipublic areas such as plazas courtyards patios small park spaces or landscaped features that is visible from surrounding streets new development should incorporate outdoor open space that projects a vibrant image and invites pedestrian activity with durable furnishings and visual elements such as public art to add interest open space location outdoor open space should be located to encourage active use in large developments an outdoor space can become a focal point on the site outdoor open space may be provided as an accent within a small project 110 locate outdoor open space to provide a focal point a locate outdoor open space to highlight key building features b position outdoor open space to facilitate sharing between adjoining buildings when possible c for a small project such as a new

clear connections between outdoor open space areas pedestrian circulation routes and building entrances c orient outdoor open space to views of activities or architectural landmarks to provide visual interest d create a sense of enclosure for an outdoor open space area by positioning buildings to frame the space or define it with landscaping open space design elements outdoor open space should be designed and furnished to provide a pedestrian amenity where possible it may also be integrated into the onsite stormwater management system to maximize the usable portion of a property 112 furnish outdoor open spaces to encourage active use a furnish outdoor open space with benches tables shelters and landscape features b ensure that furnishings are durable and suitable for outdoor conditions c locate furnishings near actively used pedestrian areas such as major pedestrian routes building entrances and outdoor gathering places d locate furnishings so they will not impede the primary pedestrian way e for a small project such as a new singlestory building consider using simple outdoor furnishings such as a bench near a building entry 113 design outdoor open space to incorporate low impact development lid principles for stormwater management a design and locate larger stormwater management systems such as bioretention areas to serve as usable open space or site amenities b use permeable surfaces and paving systems to assist with stormwater drainage c see stormwater management and lowimpact development on  sic for more information public art public art includes both decorative and functional features that are accessible or visible to the public such features may include sculptures murals mosaics street furniture benches bike racks or other functional features with an original design or other features that add interest communicate a message or generate dialog public art is encouraged as a way of bringing visual interest and special identity to individual sites and neighborhoods the guideline provided below is voluntary and is not meant to imply a requirement for inclusion of public art 114 use public art to add interest to an outdoor open space consider art that a is durable and accessible to the public b provides a focal point for an open space c is standalone or integrated into the design of a building d relates to functional site features such as gates entries sitting areas and walkways e reflects an awareness of the site and surrounding context both existing and planned f reflects the historic and cultural values of the community landscape and parking landscape and parking areas are a prominent feature of most properties in farragut landscaping surface parking and associated site lighting should work together to project a cohesive image landscaping landscaping addresses the basic aesthetics of a site including trees shrubs and other plantings as well as ornamental features and site contours sites should be landscaped to enhance community image invite pedestrian activity preserve mature trees and highlight distinctive topographic or other site features in general indigenous or wellacclimated and noninvasive species should be used landscape design within a site should also help to establish a sense of visual continuity the guidelines below are intended to complement landscaping requirements in the farragut zoning design sites to highlight landscape areas a cluster buildings to consolidate landscape areas b avoid site development patterns that leave small patches of uncoordinated open space 116 use a coordinated landscape palette to establish a sense of visual continuity a use patterns of similar tree and shrub species to establish visual consistency across a larger development b use subtle variations in the landscape palette to highlight different uses or character areas within a larger development 117 preserve and maintain mature trees and significant vegetation a include existing vegetation as a part of a landscape design scheme where appropriate b identify healthy trees and vegetation clusters for preservation special consideration should be given to mature trees six inches or greater in diameter and to vegetation clusters with significant visual impacts 118 use hardy plant and tree species a incorporate native tree and plant species in landscape design whenever possible b reserve the use of highmaintenance plants if necessary for small accent areas in the landscape 119 use landscaping to enhance pedestrian improvements a use plantings to define the edges of sidewalks pedestrian paths and outdoor open space b use plantings to highlight building entries c use shade trees to create a canopy over pedestrian areas including sidewalks paths along the street and paths parking areas 120 integrate landscaping and stormwater management systems a use stormwater management facilities such as ponds swales and bioretention areas as landscape amenities b see the guidelines for stormwater management on  sic for more information surface parking site design considerations for parking include the location of surface lots their visual impact and relationship to pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems surface parking lots should not be a visually prominent feature of sites in farragut especially those along hightraffic corridors such as kingston pike or in locations intended for strong pedestrian orientation such as the town center district 121 minimize the visual impact of surface parking a locate a parking area to the interior of a new development site this is especially important on a corner property where the street wall should have a sense of enclosure b divide a large parking area into small pods that maintain the traditional sense of smaller parking areas within a green landscape c soften the view of parked cars from a public sidewalk or street using a planted buffer of trees shrubs and ground cover or a low wall constructed from materials compatible with the surrounding context and street frontage d for a small project such as a new singlestory building consider locating up to two bays of parking one drive aisle with parking spaces on either side to the side preferred or in front of the building 122 locate and design parking lots to allow for pedestrian access a provide landscaped islands with paths to promote pedestrian circulation across larger parking areas b avoid locating a new surface parking area directly in front of primary pedestrian entries 123 design parking access to minimize potential negative impacts on pedestrians a use shared drives to access surface parking areas whenever possible to minimize the number of curb cuts along a block b provide crossproperty easements to share driveways and reduce the need for additional curbcuts when feasible farragut zoning requirements the farragut zoning base landscaping regulations for commercial office public and multifamily properties the ordinance also outlines requirements for submittal of a landscape plan to ensure that landscaping regulations have been met see town of farragut zoning  on  sic for more information on the relationship between zoning requirements and design guidelines site lighting site lighting includes streetlights light fixtures in parking lots pedestrian lighting and lighting to accent landscaping or building facades the character and level of site lighting should help establish a sense of identity and cohesion site lighting should help create a sense of place highlight distinctive architectural details and reinforce the overall form massing and spatial characteristics of the building or site note that street lights are an important feature of the overall streetscape as addressed on  sic 124 scale site lighting to its purpose a use small scale fixtures with downlighting or light bollards within landscaping to illuminate pedestrian walkways whenever possible b use fixtures that provide even lighting for a plaza courtyard or patio area c use modest lighting to illuminate building entrances and entries into parking areas d do not provide greater illumination in parking areas than at building entrances or for pedestrian walkways e design street lighting to minimize light spill onto adjacent properties and the sky 125 shield site lighting to minimize offsite glare a orient fixtures to provide downlighting b incorporate cutoff shields into fixtures to direct light downward c avoid orienting fixtures to cast light upwards onto building facades and into sky farragut zoning lighting standards the farragut zoning base outdoor site lighting requirements for all properties in farragut including maximum footcandles for lighting and maximum light pole height see town of farragut zoning  on  sic for more information working with topography many sites in farragut include topological features such as slopes and ravines or geological issues such as potential sinkholes or soil problems that influence the way that they may be developed where possible site design should preserve and work within existing topography any regrading should maintain pedestrian and vehicular connectivity while minimizing potential negative visual impacts of large retaining walls 126 design a site to take advantage of existing topography a incorporate topographic features as natural or open space amenities b maintain pedestrian connections when regrading a site c divide large grade changes into a series of benches and terraces where feasible d regrade the site as a stable natural slope when necessary e terrace parking lots on steep slopes following site contours 127 design a retaining wall to minimize impacts on the natural character of the site a terrace retaining walls on steeper slopes to minimize height of individual wallstest what happens b use high quality materials such as brick and stone in the design of a retaining wall c integrate landscaping into the design of a retaining wall 128 design a building foundation to conform to the existing topography a step the foundation of a building to follow site contours when feasible b if stepping the foundation is not possible disguise the cut with building placement andor building walls and provide a landscape buffer system at the top of a cut 129 design a site to minimize vulnerability to sinkholes a ensure that stormwater is directed away from building foundations and not allowed to permeate into known unstable soils b install underground barrier systems to protect building foundations where sinkhole risk is high c do not locate buildings on site areas prone to sinkhole development service areas and utilities service areas and utilities include loading docks trash areas electrical stations and other necessary functions they should be located and designed to be visually unobtrusive and integrated with the design of the site and the building service areas are typically most appropriate when located to the rear of a building and not visible from the public rightofway 130 locate a utility or service area to minimize visual impacts from the street and sidewalk a locate a utility or service area to the side or rear of a building b orient a service area toward a service lane or alley c integrate mechanical equipment into the design of a building d consider integrating a service or utility area into a gap in a side or rear building wall e locate a utility or service area away from residential areas or outdoor open space 131 locate and design a utility building or shed to minimize the visual impacts from the street and sidewalk a locate a utility building or shed to the rear of a primary structure b if a shed is unenclosed use wood or other high quality material with proven durability in the farragut climate 132 locate buildings and other site improvements to allow for potential future undergrounding of utility lines a install new utility service systems underground and bury all existing above ground services when renovating 133 enclose a freestanding utility or service area a when not integrated into a building wall enclose a utility or service area with an opaque wall of decorative block brick stone caststone splitfaced block stucco or other highquality material with proven durability in the farragut climate b screen the entrance to a utility or service area with a solid gate made from painted metal wood or other high quality nonreflective material that is detailed for visual interest c do not use chain link fencing in the design of a service area gate stormwater management and lowimpact development stormwater management addresses the conveyance and treatment of rainfall and other water entering a site low impact development lid is a specific development strategy to address stormwater in a way that closely mimics the natural predevelopment hydrologic system the guidelines below are intended to complement landscaping requirements in the farragut zoning promoting the use of lowimpact development principles to meet those requirements while also providing site amenities that help enhance community image 134 maintain predevelopment hydrologic features to minimize stormwater impacts a incorporate a natural drainage way as an amenity into the site plan b avoid altering or obscuring natural drainage ways 135 incorporate low impact development lid principles to address stormwater as close to the source as possible appropriate lid management systems include a permeable surfaces and paving systems b bioretention and other planted drainage areas c green roofs rain barrelscisterns and other building systems d development clustering 136 incorporate stormwater management systems to maximize water quality consider management systems that a infiltrate stormwater into the ground to mimic the natural water cycle b remove pollutants from stormwater by plants and trees in rain gardens c provide flows buffers to remove nutrients and pollutants 137 use stormwater management systems as site amenities a use rainwater as an amenity by directing stormwater to planted islands and other landscaping b include a detention area as part of the open space scheme for the site when feasible c incorporate plazas courtyards and patios into and around stormwater management systems whenever feasible d consider incorporating a green roof to help a development integrate into a forested area while also helping to address stormwater impacts e minimize the use of rip rap and other devices that do not appear natural in character see the stormwater matters page at wwwtownoffarragutorgindexaspxnid 171 for more information incremental site design improvements many redevelopment projects will involve incremental improvements to existing development on a site such as modest additions new buildings or expanded parking areas while improvements should consider long term objectives for the area and site flexibility in the application of the design guidelines is appropriate for such projects to ensure that development is able to respond to current market conditions the design guidelines below address the location of incremental improvements and associated site design see incremental building design improvements on  sic for additional information on incremental improvements 138 locate incremental improvements to anticipate future development a locate smallscale improvements to increase compliance with zoning standards and the intent of the design guidelines b locate smallscale improvements to accommodate

pedestrian environment of an existing development a site new buildings to maximize street frontage and minimize the visual impact of parking areas b place improvements to enhance the pedestrian environment for example new buildings and public open space areas may be located to create a pedestrian gateway into the site c plan for later pedestrian improvements such as connections between the street and interior buildings or to an adjacent neighborhood when locating a new building or addition community feedback on redevelopment participants in meetings and workshops for the design guidelines noted that encouraging redevelopment of underutilized properties is one of the most important objectives for the guidelines to address phased redevelopment of an existing site in some cases redevelopment of a site may be phased so that incremental improvements build towards long term objectives for the area and site in the example illustrated below an existing autooriented shopping center site in the town center subarea is redeveloped in a series of phases each phase builds on previous phases ultimately producing a longterm redevelopment scenario that promotes the vision for the town center as a traditional downtown with a variety of shops restaurants businesses and residences in a pedestrianoriented setting neighborhood site design transitions neighborhood transitions address the relationship between new or redeveloping commercial office mixeduse or multifamily residential uses and adjacent lowscale residential neighborhoods site design adjacent to an existing or future residential neighborhood should provide a compatible transition that minimizes potential negative impacts while promoting positive connections designs that incorporate compatible uses and designs and which link commercial and mixeduse areas with the adjacent residential neighborhoods are generally preferred as illustrated in strategies to promote a compatible transition to adjacent neighborhoodagricultural land on  sic note that guidelines for scale transitions related to building design are provided in neighborhood building design transitions on  sic 140 design a commercial or mixeduse site to be compatible with adjacent neighborhoods a place and orient buildings to minimize potential negative impacts on an adjacent residential neighborhood b avoid orienting the rear of

adjacent neighborhoodagricultural land where new development in farragut adjoins an existing neighborhood or agricultural land it has typically incorporated a landscape buffer area to minimize potential negative impacts in some cases however other strategies may provide a compatible transition while encouraging pedestrian and bicycle connections between neighborhoods and adjacent shops services or employment centers three such strategies are illustrated below note that the edges of a new development may incorporate a variety of strategies including a typical landscape buffer or some combination of the strategies illustrated below where a landscape buffer is used it should incorporate breaks for pedestrian and bicycle connections 20  building design guidelines new construction and

the illustrated development is intended to enhance community image quality design on a key site and signal arrival into farragut for motorists on the interstate building scale the overall size height and form of a building help determine how large it appears and whether it is compatible with the surrounding context although a new building may be larger than adjacent buildings it should not be monolithic in scale or create a jarring contrast recognizing existing patterns such as varied heights smaller building masses and articulated facades will help a new building fit with its neighbors and the overall context of farragut building height maximum overall building height is addressed by the farragut zoning code new development should meet zoning requirements while recognizing traditional height variations in farragut and stepping down towards adjacent lowerscale buildings 21 provide variation in building heights a use variation in building and parapet heights to add visual interest and reduce boxy or monolithic building masses b incorporate height variations that are similar to the heights of adjacent buildings 22 position taller building elements to minimize visual impacts a step back a larger building mass from the street when possible to reduce looming effects b use lower scale buildings or building elements to transition the scale of a taller building towards lowerscale buildings on adjacent properties 23 design floortofloor heights to establish a sense of scale and reflect farragut traditions a while overall building heights may vary along a block design

incorporate iconic design features to foster a unique sense of place add visual interest and help differentiate farragut from surrounding areas in most cases largescale new development projects in any location should also incorporate iconic design features 26 use iconic design features to foster a unique sense of place a incorporate iconic design features such as welldefined entries or tower elements into the design of a new development that is largescale or located in a highly visible location see options for conveying iconic design on  sic for additional information b consider incorporating scaleddown versions of iconic features such as a modest tower element above an entry on a smaller building 27 locate iconic design features to maximize their visibility and impact appropriate locations include a at primary building entries b adjacent or at the entrance to outdoor public spaces c at the corner of a building especially when the building itself is at the intersection of two streets or lanes d at the termination of a view or vista ie located to be highly visible when looking down a street or path roof form roof form addresses the visible characteristics of a buildings roof new development should incorporate roof forms that convey compatible mass and scale add visual interest and are appropriate to a buildings use 28 create a sense of visual interest by using a variety of roof forms along the street a use a combination of gable hip and flat roof forms to provide visual interest see  varied roof forms on  sic for illustrations b vary the roof profile by steeping down some parts of the facade 29 consider incorporating a roof form that provides a cap a define a flat roof form with a distinct parapet or cornice line this can help reinforce a vertical base middle and cap building articulation and contribute to a sense of iconic design b use an overhang on sloped roof forms on multifamily buildings this helps to define the roof as a building cap c see  base middle cap design on  sic for more information options for conveying iconic design several options for conveying iconic building design are illustrated below on a onestory commercial building a threestory multifamily building and a twostory mixeduse building they may be used individually or in combination to meet the intent of the design guidelines for iconic design on  sic note that one feature may sometimes meet the definition of more than one option ie a tower element may be rounded and help define a building entry other creative strategies may also be appropriate overall facade character visible building facades that incorporate highquality design features enhance farraguts community image and convey an active and vibrant appearance to passing vehicles and pedestrians the design guidelines for overall facade character below apply to visible facade areas that face public streets sidewalks pedestrian areas or parking lots they are especially important for visible facades along a major commercial corridor such as kingston pike or campbell station road note that the guidelines for iconic design features on  sic and building materials and

phases of development that may include new buildings parking areas and pedestrian paths 221 when possible renovate an aging commercial or office facade to enhance community image features to consider include a the addition of iconic building features or improved building materials to enhance community image b improved ground floor design or the addition of small ground floor uses such as a cafe or bank to a largeformat retail building to encourage pedestrian activity 222 anticipate future phases of development when renovating a facade a consider relocating a primary building entrance to provide more direct pedestrian access to planned buildings or parking areas b consider existing and future view corridors when locating iconic design features on a renovated facade adaptive reuse adaptive reuse is the process of reusing an old site or building for a purpose other than which it was built or designed for preserving and adapting a structure to a new use has environmental benefits and may help preserve the existing character of an area reusing a building preserves the energy and resources invested in its construction and removes the need for producing new construction materials adaptive reuse projects are encouraged 223 adapt an existing structure to a new use as an alternative to demolition whenever possible a consider the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse when planning improvements b consider the potential economic benefits of adaptive reuse when planning improvements 224 consider future objectives for the site when adapting an existing structure to a new

signs with the objectives for the overall character of the area is a key consideration the town seeks to convey the commercial health of the community with signage that is in character with the communitys landscape and buildings a new or modified sign should exhibit qualities of style permanence and compatibility with the natural and built environment it should also reflect the overall context of the building and surrounding area this chapter provides design guidelines for signs throughout farragut including design guidelines for specific sign types and sign illumination it also addresses signage in the town center general sign guidelines a sign should be in character with the materials colors and details of the building its content should be visually interesting and clearly legible illumination sources should be shielded to minimize glare and light pollution 41 locate and design a sign to be subordinate to the overall site and building design a design a sign to be simple in character b locate and design a sign to emphasize rather than overshadow building features c do not locate or design a sign to be the most prominent feature of a site or building 42 use sign materials that are compatible with the architectural character and materials of the building a use permanent durable materials that reflect the farragut context such materials may include painted or carved wood individual wood or cast metal letters or symbols stone such as slate marble or sandstone and painted gilded or sandblasted glass b consider using a metal sign if it is appropriate to the architectural character of the building c do not use highly reflective materials on a sign 43 use colors for the sign that are compatible with those of the building facade a use sign colors that complement not clash with the color of the building facade b limit the number of colors used on a sign in general no more than three colors should be used although accent colors and additional colors for illustrations may be considered c use dark backgrounds with light colored lettering examples of preferred background colors are burgundy red forest green chocolate brown black charcoal and navy blue preferred lettering colors are ivory white or gold d avoid using day glow colors 44 use simple legible characters that enhance the visibility of sign content a use a typeface that is similar to traditional typefaces in the area when possible b traditional block and curvilinear styles that are easy to read are preferred c avoid hardtoread or overly intricate typeface styles d use no more than two or three distinct typefaces on a sign guidelines for specific sign types the guidelines below supplement the general design guidelines with additional information regarding the use of several specific sign types sign types are defined and illustrated on  sic 45 locate and design a wall sign to promote design compatibility among buildings a place a wall sign to align with other signs on nearby buildings b use a consistent design scheme or colors for wall signs related to neighboring businesses in the same building or center c design a wall sign to minimize the depth of a sign panel or letters d design a wall sign to fit within rather than forward of the fascia or other architectural details of a building 46 locate and design a groundmounted sign to be in character with its setting a when using a groundmounted sign locate it in a landscaped area near the primary vehicular or pedestrian entrance to the site b integrate a groundmounted sign into the overall landscape design c coordinate design and materials between groundmounted signs and buildings on the same site whenever possible 47 locate and design a directional parking sign to be subordinate to other onsite signage a coordinate design and materials with other onsite groundmounted signage b use a simple design that clearly assists with onsite wayfinding 48 locate and design an address sign to clearly indicate the property address a locate an address sign on the top portion of a groundmounted sign when it is located at the primary entry to a site b locate coordinated address signs above or near each individual entrance to a business in a center when possible c design an address sign to be simple and subordinate in character illustrated sign types a number of typical sign types are defined and illustrated below for reference these sign types relate to the general design guidelines for signs on  sic as well as the guidelines for specific sign types on  sic although some of the sign types illustrated below may be appropriate in the town center district tcd a different scale and design is often appropriate as illustrated on  sic sign illumination illumination should occur in a manner that is subordinate to the overall building its site and neighborhood while meeting the functional needs of the business within this framework the creative use of lighting to add accent and interest to the street for pedestrians is encouraged 49 use a compatible shielded light source to illuminate a sign a direct lighting towards a sign from an external shielded lamp b do not overpower the building or street edge with lighting c use a warm light similar to daylight d if halo lighting is used to accentuate a sign or building locate the light source so that it is not visible 410 if internal illumination is used design it to be subordinate to the overall building composition a if internal illumination is used use a system that backlights sign text only whenever possible b ensure that the light source is not visible c avoid internal illumination of an entire sign panel d do not use internal illumination for a sign in the town center sign guidelines for the town center signs that are scaled to the pedestrian are especially encouraged signs that appear to be customdesigned and fabricated and convey visual interest in the urban setting are preferred 411 locate and design a sign to coordinate with facade design in the town center a locate a sign to fit within a specially designed area on the building facade b design signs to use durable materials that are coordinated with architectural or other materials on the building facade 412 design a sign to convey visual interest to pedestrians in the town center a locate signs to be clearly visible to pedestrians b locate signs to highlight primary pedestrian entries 413 locate and design a perpendicular wall sign to relate to building entries and convey visual interest in the town center a locate a small perpendicular wall sign near the business entrance just above or to the side of the door b mount a larger perpendicular wall sign higher on the building centered on the facade or positioned at the corner c use dynamic sculptural shapes where possible to convey visual interest in the design of a perpendicular wall sign 414 use a directory sign to consolidate small individual signs on a larger building in the town center a use a consolidated tenant panel or directory sign to help users find building tenants b locate a consolidated tenant panel or directory sign near a primary entrance on the first floor wall of a building 415 locate and design an under canopy sign to highlight building entries in the town center a when using an under canopy sign locate it beneath a canopy and directly above a
