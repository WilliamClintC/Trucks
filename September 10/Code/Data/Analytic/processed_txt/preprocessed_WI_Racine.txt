and welfare of the property and persons in the city of racine by prohibiting persons under 18 years of age from possessing nicotine and vapor products and prohibiting the sale of these products to persons under 18 years of age b over the last few years the popularity of electronic cigarettes has increased substantially particularly among the youth population electronic cigarettes are tobaccoless handheld devices that allow its user to simulate cigarette smoking and are also commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems for purposes of this section all of these electronic smoking devices are referred to as an electronic nicotine delivery system ends c ends vary in their appearance and specific method of operation although they do have a few basic elements in common the devices work by heating up an eliquid that generates an aerosol or vapor to be inhaled by its user these eliquid solutions typically contain nicotine propylene glycol glycerine and other flavorings the concentration of nicotine contained in the solution can be customized by the retailer to the buyers specifications and many manufacturers make nicotinefree solutions d ends often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products these devices may be manufactured to look like conventional cigarettes cigars or pipes some resemble pens or usb flash drives larger devices such as tank systems or mods bear little or no resemblance to cigarettes currently these products come in many different flavors that appeal to young people e the us food and drug administrative fda currently regulates the manufacture import packaging labeling advertising promotion sale and distribution of all electronic nicotine delivery systems and prohibits the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age under wisconsin law persons under 18 years of age are prohibited from purchasing or possessing cigarettes tobacco products or nicotine products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors wisconsin law however does not currently regulate nicotinefree vapor products or prohibit the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age f existing studies on vapor emissions and the cartridge contents of electronic smoking devices have found a number of dangerous substances including 1 chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  2 pm 25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke g some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution thereby creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine h clinical studies regarding the safety and efficacy of such products have not been submitted to the fda for the over 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers have no way of knowing whether electronic smoking devices are safe what types of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain and what dose of nicotine the products deliver i despite current fda rules banning the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age the use of ecigarettes and similar devices by middle and high school students have continued to increase significantly in recent years j the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverses the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment k it is the intent of the common council in enacting the ordinance codified in this section to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to minors l therefore the city of racine common council determines that prohibiting the sale giving or furnishing of electronic nicotine delivery systems and vapor products to minors and prohibiting the purchase possession or use of such products by minors is in the citys best interest and will promote public health safety and welfare pt 1 6419 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except

prohibited a findings and purpose the common council of the city of racine finds that public nuisances exist in the city of racine in the activities happening on within and surrounding certain commercial and residential premises in violation of the city of racine municipal ordinances all of which interfere with the publics interest in the quality of life and total community environment tone of commerce and property and neighborhood values nuisance activities contribute to the general decay of affected neighborhoods and negatively impact residents in those neighborhoods the common council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to the health safety and welfare of the people of the city of racine and of the businesses thereof and visitors thereto the common council finds that certain commercial and residential premises in the city of racine require a disproportionate amount of resources from the city of racines various departments to be devoted to addressing nuisance activities and violations of the city of racine municipal ordinances that occur thereon a chronic nuisance is a public nuisance the common council finds that any premises that has generated three or more responses from the police department within a 90day period or three or more responses from other code enforcement officers within a 180day period for public nuisance activities has received more than the level of general and adequate police service and has placed an undue and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the city often this disproportionate devotion of city resources is due to property owners own actions or the failure of property owners to accept and exercise sufficient responsibility for and over the actions of occupants guests agents employees or other persons associated with the premises that reside within or frequent the premises the common council further finds that premises owners and occupants conducting business activities upon the premises who chronically fail to control the use of their property substantially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life health and safety of the community this section is enacted to encourage property owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property conform to the law and do not unduly burden the citys resources to provide a mechanism for the city to take action against property owners who fail to abate nuisance activities occurring on their premises and to recover the costs associated any disproportionate devotion of city resources devoted to addressing nuisance activities the common council therefore directs the chief of police chief of fire public health administrator chief building

private service line b at the time of adoption of this section there are approximately 9000 properties in the city where both the utilitys service line and the private service line are made of lead additionally there are properties in the city where the utilitys service line is made of lead and the private service line is made of copper cast iron or galvanized iron lead private service lines and iron private service lines that are connected to lead public service lines are collectively referred to herein as the eligible private service lines c there are two types of public works projects normally performed by the racine water utility collectively the public works projects that include work performed on behalf of the water utility as funds are available to replace the utilitys service lines that are made of lead in the city one project involves the replacement of a water main under a street in that type of project in addition to replacing the water main the water utility also removes the utilitys service lines made of lead in the area of the project and replaces those lines with copper tubing or pipe copper pipe the other project type involves a road replacement where the condition of the water main is such that it does not need to be replaced in that type of project the water utility only replaces the utilitys service line made of lead with copper pipe d the private service lines are on private property accordingly the replacement of private service lines are the responsibility of the private property owners and not the utility the wisconsin public service commission psc does not recognize private service lines as the property or responsibility of the water utility in its rules and regulations and does not permit the water utility to apply the money it collects from its water service rates to pay for the replacement of any private service lines e it is expected that from time to time the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr united states environmental protection agency usepa or united states congress will make funds available to the water utility or the city outside funds that are earmarked to fund the replacement of eligible private service lines with copper pipe any outside funds that are made available to the water utility may be required to be expended during the year in which the funds were made available the city may also be allowed to utilize community development block grants cdbg funds for the funding of eligible private service lines f the usepa and wdnr have indicated to the water utility that the removal of only a portion of a lead service line serving a property and replacement thereof with copper pipe may negatively impact a property owners water quality and could increase the amount of lead in the homeowners water for a period of time accordingly the usepa and wdnr had expressed a preference that partial lead service line replacement projects be minimized and whenever possible all lead service lines connected to a property be replaced to enhance the safety of the water that is delivered to the property g during each year that outside funds are made available to the water utility the water utility shall make the determination to use those funds in the following order of priority until the funds are expended 1 priority one projects to fund the replacement of eligible private service lines in connection with public works projects ie total lead service line replacements if sufficient funds are not available to replace all eligible private service lines in a given funding cycle the water works commission shall develop a priority list for use in determining the eligible private service lines that will be replaced 2 priority two projects if there are outside funds remaining after funding the priority one projects then the outside funds may be used to fund the replacement of private service lines that are made of lead or iron where a a lead utility service line serving a property was previously replaced with a copper pipe or b the water utility decides to replace a lead utility service line serving a property with copper pipe if the replacement is not part of the work included in a public works project 1 this could involve replacement of a previous lead service where houses in the distribution system are being reconstructed to be viable dwellings once again 2 this could also involve requests from residents that were previously sampled for lead and where high lead results above epa standards are known to exist if there are not enough outside funds to pay for all priority two projects in any given year the water utility may choose to allocate the funds expended within the priority two classification to locations discussed in paragraph b above or at schools nursing homes day care centers and other multiresident properties if such properties and entities are willing recipients eligible private service lines that are leaking or in otherwise poor condition may be given higher priority than other priority two projects that are not leaking or are in otherwise fair condition h the outside funds cannot be used for the replacement of copper or plastic private service lines that are broken or leaking i all private service line replacements shall be performed by licensed contractors and conform to all applicable state and local codes regulations and ordinances j payments for replacement of private service lines may be made as rebates to private property owners or directly to contractors who replace the lines for private property owners k the water utility shall formulate and carry out a private lateral replacement program that conforms to this section the above program shall be subject to approval by the water works commission and may be amended as circumstances warrant provided that the program shall at all times comply with this section l the status of the material comprising each public and private service line will be recorded on the city geographic information system gis as part of any replacement effort should a homeowner decline to participate this will also be recorded pt 1 121416 secs 98659870  reserved division 2  water

production the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the general manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates upon notification of a revised production rate the general manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit when developing equivalent mass limits the general manager 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 98151g the industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 98151j regarding the prohibition of bypass 4 the general manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the general manager note when converting such limits to concentration limits the general manager will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by subsection 98151g of this division see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the general manager will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 5 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived note see 40 cfr 4036c7 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation note see 40 cfr 4036c8 6 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the general manager within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the general manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate note see 40 cfr 4036c9 c the general manager may impose additional limits andor monitoring requirements on pollutants of concern d the general manager may develop best management

rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wisconsin administrative nr  pt 1 8204 findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding pt 1 8204 purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this article is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve groundcover and scenic beauty and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property b intent it is the intent of the common council that this article regulate postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state

mirrored in every aspect but rather used as a starting point in the development of a design 2 harmony the facility utilizes materials forms and colors that serve as unifying elements with the surrounding built and natural environment such uniformity is not intended to inhibit creativity innovation and individuality in the overall design of a facility 3 conformance the facility does not detract from those architectural details found to be most successful and prominent in historical and landmark downtown area structures 4 linkages the facility reflects the individuality of the specific area or district in which it is located and if reasonably possible articulates identifiable architectural patterns 5 compatibility the facility should be compatible with nearby buildings
