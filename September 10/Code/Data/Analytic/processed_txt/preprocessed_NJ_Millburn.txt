1967    it is hereby determined that the areas hereinafter designated as municipal offstreet parking lots are necessary for the orderly control of traffic in the township the township has two railroad stations on the erielackawanna railroad that serve commuters from a broad area to newark and new york these stations are also contiguous to active shopping centers each of these uses requires parking facilities to accommodate customers with different demands for time for parking to suit their needs generally speaking shopper parking is of shorttime duration so such spaces accommodate several customers in a business day commuter parking however usually accommodates only one customer per space per day the objective to be accomplished by this section is the separation of these two facilities of different requirements so one does not infringe on the use of the other and to do this with a minimum cost of service to the township it has been the policy of the township to issue permits at a reasonable cost for commuters from and to our community from a service cost standpoint permits are the most economical to administer therefore the provisions of this section will favor the use of permit parking for commuters and will require that the usual fee be deposited in a meter if a permit designated vehicle occupies a metered space in either a commuter or shopping area  7353 method of limiting and regulating parking 1967  it is hereby determined and stated that the parking of vehicles in the municipal offstreet parking lots provided and maintained by the township shall be limited

and after the deposit of the proper coin shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in accordance with the directions thereon the failure to deposit such coin and to set the timing

the township by drawing continuously upon it during periods when the need for the cooling and humidification of the interiors of buildings coincides with droughts and infrequency and inadequacy of rainfall and involves a waste of the available supply of water in the township by permitting it to flow beyond such air conditioning or refrigeration systems into the sanitary sewer system of the

millburn state of new jersey does ordain as follows  7012 findings of fact  a the flood hazard areas of millburn are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 7013 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed  a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric

point 7061 intent and purpose the township committee of the township of millburn finds that riparian lands adjacent to streams lakes or other surface water bodies that are adequately vegetated provide an important environmental protection and water resource management benefit it is necessary to protect and maintain the beneficial character of riparian areas by implementing specifications for the establishment protection and maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within the jurisdiction of the township of millburn consistent with the interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land that include such designated areas the purpose of this ordinance is to designate riparian zones and to provide for land use regulation therein in order to protect the streams lakes and other surface water bodies of the township of millburn  to protect the water quality of watercourses reservoirs lakes and other significant water resources within the township of millburn  to protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems of the township of millburn  to provide for the environmentally sound use of the land resources of the township of millburn and to complement existing state regional county and municipal stream corridor protection and management regulations and initiatives the specific purposes and intent of this ordinance are to 2 a restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources of the township of millburn   drz705 millburn code  drz706 ao608 b prevent excessive nutrients sediment and organic matter as well as biocides and other pollutants from reaching surface waters by optimizing opportunities for filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation and denitrification which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed buffers as stable distributed flow prior to reaching receiving waters  c provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate temperatures retain more dissolved oxygen and support a healthy assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna  d provide for the availability of natural organic matter leaves and twigs and large woody debris trees and limbs that provide food and habitat for aquatic organisms insects amphibians crustaceans and small fish which are essential to maintain the food chain  e increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial geomorphology of the stream system thereby reducing stream bank erosion and sedimentation and protecting habitat for aquatic organisms  f maintain base flows in streams and moisture in wetlands  g control downstream flooding  and h conserve the natural features important to land and water resources eg headwater areas ground water recharge zones floodways floodplains springs streams
