this district provides a restricted and limited use overlay device to allow flexible review procedures and mixeduse development in municipal and extraterritorial areas designated by the planning commission special and mixed use development is encouraged as an infill technique on underused tracts or lots on properties that have remained unused because of physical conditions or constraints and in areas of potential conflicts that require special planning and review procedures to protect nearby areas b operation the sdod is an overlay device that requires specific application review and special conditions imposed by the planning commission a casebycase examination of site conditions nearby uses and potential conflicts is necessary before the overlay district can be used to permit new development this district is not intended to grant special benefits to property owners who otherwise cannot achieve development permission because of detrimental impacts on the use value and enjoyment of nearby property rather the proper use of this district recognizes the historic mixed character of neighborhood development in marysville and the under use of certain areas where new development will be beneficial implementation of the sdod does not change the underlying zoning district c where allowed the following districts are eligible to receive the overlay district 1 any district designated 100 year floodplain on the marysville firm 2 any c2 or ch zoning district 3 any r2 zoning district 4 any i1 or i2 zoning district 5 any multifamily commercial or residential use classified

reconstruction amendments penalties for violation statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the governing body of the city of marysville kansas ordains the following regulations findings of fact a the special flood hazard areas of the city of marysville kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by 1 cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages   c the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto  2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood  3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of the floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program lands to which this article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of marysville kansas identified on the flood insurance rate map firm as zone al6 and within the zoning districts fw and ff established in of this article in all areas covered by this article no

the city inspector andor the zoning administrator are hereby designated as the governing bodys duly designated enforcement officers under this article boundaries for interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of zoning appeals will resolve the dispute the regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present hisher case to the board and to submit hisher own technical evidence if heshe so desires compliance no development located within known flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations abrogation and greater

approaches a offsite measures including detention on public rightofway or on property owned by others where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such measures and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance b offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by private parties where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such improvements and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance by the developer c offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by the city or another public agency at no cost to the city provided that the governing body approves such alterations to city owned public facilities or that any necessary approvals required from other public agencies are secured 5 where the amount of storage capacity can be increased to provide a benefit to the public as in cases where a channel draining other properties and streets passes subject property negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible 15  304 stormwater facilities all stormwater conduits channels basins inlets etc must be capable of accommodating the calculated peak of stormwater discharge assuming full development of the upstream catchment basin as determined by an engineer duly licensed by the state of kansas construction of all such facilities shall be in accordance with city standards and shall be subject to inspection by the city for compliance therewith stormwater regulations where stormwater facilities can be upsized to create a benefit to the public negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible 15  305 construction timing and certification the developer shall furnish the city with a certification by an engineer duly licensed by the state of kansas that the stormwater control measures are complete having the required storage capacity and that all stormwater facilities are fully functional prior to the development of any land the runoff from which is to be addressed by the control measure in the case of a subdivision  or prior to occupancy of a building in the case of other developments 15  306 stream protection corridor in cases where a defined open drainage course serving an upstream basin or ten 10 or more acres passes beside or property proposed to be subdivided or developed a stream protection corridor shall be provided wherein no buildings or structures shall be sited and no soil shall be disturbed except as needed to furnish utilities or to meet the above requirements the purpose of the corridor is to provide for sufficient vegetation to absorb filter and slow the speed of stormwater entering the drainage course removal of trees shrubs and ground cover in such corridors shall be minimized unless suitably replaced within sixty 60 days of construction restoration of vegetation shall be addressed in the developers stormwater management plan for the site the width of the required corridor shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course defined as the edge of vegetation where delineated or the edge of the channel required to accommodate a two year storm where not delineated the width of the required corridor from the ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course shall be in accordance with the following table contribut ing drainage area minimum buffer width 10 to 40 acres 30 feet 40 to 160 acres 50 feet 160 to 2200 acres 60 feet greater than 2200 acres 100 feet 15  307 operation and maintenance all stormwater management systems shall have an
