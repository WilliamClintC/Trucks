1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards this section uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selections of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the regulatory flood selected for this section is representative of large floods known to have occurred in this region and which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this section it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to occur on the average once every one hundred years or has a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the flood insurance study and illustrative material firm dated  chapter 165 zoning regulations code of ordinances dyersville iowa  642  b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood  c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point  d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height  e delineation of the floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood 4 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described herein by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause increased flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard  d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the federal flood insurance program 5 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this section does not imply that areas outside floodways and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages this
