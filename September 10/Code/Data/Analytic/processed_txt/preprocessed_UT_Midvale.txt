developed in response to the citys previous planning projects the 2016 general plan gp identifies the neighborhood as one of the citys opportunity areas the main street small area plan sap was adopted in 2018 to further define what those opportunities are develop more specific goals and provide strategic projects to achieve those goals creating and adopting an fbc for the main street area is one of those strategic projects 2the fbc district is located in a unique place near the western edge of the city limits and between the recent bingham junction developments and the i15 and railway corridor it incorporates the historic main street and the surrounding light industrial and commercial properties the fbc district boundary is shown in figure 101 figure 101 main street formbased boundary image bgoals 1the goals for the future of the main street neighborhood are presented in both the gp and sap these goals were developed over several years planning processes that included input from local residents business and property owners elected and professional members of the city government and professional planning consultants 2the many goals for the main street neighborhood can be combined into one objective create a vibrant walkable town center the individual goals include improved connectivity to the surrounding areas and trax station bikeway connections humanscale walkable development both to preserve the historic character of main street and promote new development greater use diversity support existing businesses and attract new investment strengthen residential areas and improve neighborhood identity 3when implemented well fbcs have been shown to produce more reliably predictable outcomes than traditional land use zoning when preferred development goals are identified an fbc can be customized to achieve the desired results this fbc has been written and designed to meet the specific goals for the future of midvales main street neighborhood chistory and existing conditions 1midvale city formerly known as bingham junction was established at an important railroad crossing and became a center of mining industries from 1871 to 198 several different companies operated a number of smelters refineries and mills just west of main street these operations processed copper lead zinc arsenic silver and cadmium from ores that originated from mines in both the bingham and little cottonwood canyons the main street neighborhood sprang up directly adjacent to these extensive ore industries and became the thriving downtown of midvale city 2since the height of the midvale mining industry the main street neighborhood has faced significant challenges main street is no longer the commercial and social center of the city it was incrementally isolated by the construction of i15 freight and commuter railways and the contaminated land left behind by the smelters 3recent changes have added new value and activity to the neighborhoods around main street the large bingham junction commercial and residential development on the previously contaminated smelter land the trax light rail commuter station and new buildings in the area including city hall have given the neighborhood momentum for improvement recent planning efforts are guiding this momentum to produce a thriving town center type of neighborhood att a part 177112 form districts aform

building forms historic character and experience of the traditional main street 2the district boundary is drawn to include all land parcels that are adjacent to the main street rightofway this boundary allows the form of the entire street to be guided by the same form standards this will build up a street that is continuously cohesive in its form maintains the character of a traditional main street and is legible as the citys historic main street 3the main street street type is unique to the ms district this street type provides public space with the characteristics that are compatible with the existing and historic buildings and a pedestrianoriented main street experience shared bike lanes along main street introduce additional connections and people 4uses permitted in the ms district are compatible with both the permitted building types and with an active town center that serves the needs of local residents residential uses will help activate the ms district 5the primary frontage along main street ensures that buildings front directly on the street this provides the spatial relationship between buildings and the street that supports the pedestrian nature and

town center this expands the town center style development from main street to the greater neighborhood 2the tcc district is the largest district in the fbc area the boundary is drawn to include properties along the major streets holden st700 w and center st and parcels adjacent to those streetfronting properties this guides future development and redevelopment that concentrates along these major streets and creates a town center neighborhood rather than just a main street 3the street hierarchy is evident within the tcc district which includes all three types of streets these street types are complemented with frontage types that create a hierarchy of smoothly transitioning streetbuilding spatial relationships 4redevelopment in the tcc district provides an opportunity to build new streets that provide the muchneeded connection across holden street this increased connectivity supports multiple modes of transportation 5the tcc district accommodates most diversity of uses and

approval examples in this chapter are drawn in detail for clarification purposes only when applying the described standards to actual streets other configurations are possible 3typical street elements typical elements of a rightofway are divided into vehicular and pedestrian realms generally the vehicular realm will be designed and controlled by the city the pedestrian realm will be designed and improved by property owners in coordination with the city athe vehicular realm is the space between the curbs on both sides of a street it is comprised of travel lanes parking lanes turn lanes transit stopping areas bike lanes and medians bthe pedestrian realm is the space between the back of a street curb and the property line of the adjacent parcel it is subdivided into two spaces the park strip and the sidewalk the sidewalk is the paved area along the edge of the rightofway sidewalks are designed for the movement of pedestrian traffic along the street and pedestrian access to buildings the park strip is the space between the sidewalk and the curb it acts as a buffer area between the sidewalk and street park strips can be used in two different ways described as twouse zones the landscape zone and furnishings zone these twouse zones are intermixed along each street based on the street type requirements ithe landscape zone is where the park strip is unpaved and landscaped with ornamental plants mulch andor street trees it may also include swales lighting public art and signage iithe furnishings zone is a paved portion of the park strip it is designed for the pedestrian uses that would block the movement of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk such as sitting and gathering furnishings zones may include street trees in grates street furniture lighting signage bicycle parking bollards public art and transit stops 4vehicular travel lanes the number and width of vehicular travel lanes parking lanes and bike lanes are determined by the street type 5bicycle lanes the following

for bicycle use only this lane typically occurs on both sides of the street and shall be five feet wide the width of any adjacent gutters shall not be included in the bike lane width bmarked shared lanes are shared by both vehicular and bicycle traffic and are indicated by the shared arrow or sharrow symbol a directional arrow painted on the pavement marked shared lanes are typically wider than a standard vehicular travel lane and should be a minimum of thirteen feet wide cunmarked shared lanes refers to streets without any marked bicycle lanes that have traffic speeds and enough space for cyclists to safely ride along without designations markings or signage these are essentially determined by each individual cyclist are unregulated and are not actual lanes 6transportation facilities

frontages ageneral requirements 1intent athe frontage requirements outlined in this section define the interface between the public and private realms this interface occurs at the line where each land parcel abuts a public rightofway referred to as the frontage and is a continuous feature along both sides of each street building facades are a major component of this publicprivate interface so building type is constrained by frontage type 2frontage types athree different frontage types are defined and applied to specific streets as shown in the frontage map figure 501 multiple types are used to create a town center neighborhood with a variety of streetfrontage combinations these combinations reinforce the street hierarchy based on each streets connectivity function capacity and its role in creating a walkable vibrant town center bthe three frontage types are primary secondary and tertiary primary frontages are applied to the major roads including main street and the major secondary frontages are applied to the roads that directly connect to the major roads tertiary frontages are applied to the most minor streets cthe hierarchy of frontage types in order of priority is iprimary frontage  iisecondary frontage  iiitertiary frontage dif multiple frontages exist on a single parcel the frontage requirements shall be based on the highest priority frontage affecting the lot 3frontage specifications aminimum frontage coverage may be reduced to provide for a driveway access when no other frontage is available to be used for access when frontage coverage is reduced using this provision the provided driveway shall be limited to the minimum width required for access as determined by city staff using the minimum width as a standard and the remaining frontage shall be covered by a building or btz pedestrian space as otherwise allowed within this title figure 501 frontage map image figure 502 lot configuration types image bprimary frontage 1intent aprimary frontages accommodate more intense development and maintain the town center type of spatial relationships between buildings and streets buildings are located very close to the rightofway creating a consistent street wall and prioritizing walkability bthe values of the various parameters provide less flexibility than the other frontage types primary frontages are applied only to the main street

further explains or defines the requirements for each open space type refer to tables 702 for the specific requirements of each open space type bdimensions ithe minimum area of all open space types is measured within the lot lines of the property iithe maximum area of all open space types is measured within the lot lines of the property iiithe minimum dimension requirement is a way to make sure that the size of an open space is not too small for its particular open space type the minimum dimension for all open space types is derived from overlaying the open space plan with two straight lines that intersect at right angles and whose endpoints are at the outer property lines the first line is placed at the longest distance across the open space the second line crosses the first line at a right angle at the place on the first line that follows the longest distance in the direction perpendicular to the first line the minimum dimension is the shorter of these two lines figure 701 shows three examples of measuring the minimum dimension figure 701 minimum dimension measurement examples image cthe minimum access requirement ensures access and visibility for the open space it is described in two ways ithe percentage of the total perimeter that must be adjacent to a public rightofway iithe minimum number of andor spacing between access points into the open space dadjacent lots
