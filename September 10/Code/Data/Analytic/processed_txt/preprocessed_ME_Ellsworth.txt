source eg a realtor indicates that the land in question can be sold at fair market value for an amount which will aid the applicants financial rehabilitation  and 6 no other circumstances exist which

or render saleable land which could be used to provide necessary support for the applicant eg the applicant owns 100 excess acres sale of 10 of the acres would provide for the necessary support and therefore not all the land need be sold at the present time assistance shall not be denied during the time that the applicant is making a good faith effort to sell or render saleable the land in question once the applicant ceases to receive assistance the obligations under this section shall also cease 82005 34 b other property if the applicant or dependents own real property other than that
