ordain as follows  exh 1art 1  a 1242011  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of valley alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  exh 1art 1  b 1242011  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  exh 1art 1  c 1242011  objectives the objectives of this article are 1

practicable as long as the proposed uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and the character of the surrounding area the granting of this privilege by the city carries with it a good faith expectation that the proposed development will occur in a timely and deliberate manner therefore when the city council grants approval of a rezoning the applicant should acquire a zoning permit or final plat approval whichever is applicable and commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one 1 year of the date upon which the rezoning is approved if such

to immediate replacement per the original plan if they were 52 landscape development objectives the overall intention of the landscape scheme for fjdgc is to create a simple unifying landscaped setting with an appropriate sense of scale for the various parcels the landscape treatment may vary in character to reflect that of the building site and setting the consistency of the landscaping is intended to add an image of quality to fjdgc and to unite the various parcels of materials and continuity of frontage design the expected effect is subject to the aesthetic interpretation of the drb or their appointed consultant and the objectives for any site will be discussed at the predesign conference the desired results can be achieved use of a limited plant palette with skillfully arranged massing of similar plant materials along street frontages at vehicular entries and around buildings except within internal courtyards fussy smallscale residential gardentype landscaping will not be acceptable low maintenance and native species are encouraged to reinforce the architectural elements simple plant massings any plant material which presently exists on the site should be respected during all phases of site design and development the initial site planning effort should seek to preserve as much existing vegetation as possible use of 25 controlled clearing and grading operations planting space within parking areas and innovative architectural modification to accommodate specific tree locations any damage to existing landscaping or other site improvements which by approval of the parcel development plans were intended and expected to be preserved from such damage shall be immediately repaired and replaced to their previous condition at the parcel developers expense and subject to approval by the drb an approved plant material list has been provided as appendix a to this document while additional materials not listed may be approved for use by the drb it is intended that consistent repeated use of a core group of species the overall development landscape effect will be unified cold tender high maintenance and otherwise unsuitable plant materials shall be avoided except for specific uses such as seasonal bedding plants which will be purposefully replaced 53 landscape design criteria every building shall be appropriately and thoroughly landscaped in accordance with these standards and criteria and in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted to and approved by the drb unimproved property shall be sodded or seeded if necessary with grass or wildflowers and properly maintained until the start of construction sites in fjdgc require effective screening via walls or landscaping of all transformers switchgear air conditioning equipment

landscape buffers as required in shall be landscaped to include continuous hedge or massed plantings of shrubs plant materials shall be selected to screen and buffer adjacent sites but allow aesthetic frontage views along fjd the drb reserves the right to require subjective landscape buffering provisions where commercial sites abut residential uses if deemed necessary to increase screening and buffering between such uses in such cases more depth density and height of plantings may be required ii shrubs shall be installed in a minimum size of 3gallon containers spaced 3 feet  on center height and spread shall be appropriate for each species but screening of parking areas shall require a minimum installed height of 2 for shrubs shrubs shall be sized and spaced are required for

create a soft gently rolling effect on otherwise flat terrain and are a desired treatment for the frontage areas of fjdgc they must gradually taper into the surrounding area from a maximum slope of  and should have softly rounded tops for ease in mowing berms or slopes over  slope shall be planted solid with groundcover when used repeatedly mounds should create an irregular natural appearance with variations in both height and width they are recommended as screening devices with or without plant material to lessen the visual impact of service and parking areas they may also be used where practical in front of setback areas for a soft visual effect although the may be used in combination with plant groupings mounds are to be covered mainly in grass with only clustered plant or tree groupings emerging h all plant beds shall be mulched with pine straw for a consistent appearance throughout fjdgc other mulches including bark wood chips stone or synthetic materials shall not be used
