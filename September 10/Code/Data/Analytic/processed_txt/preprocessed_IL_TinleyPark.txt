and also threatening the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the village and also recognize the need to provide the means to eliminate such problems in order to insure the safety of the property and residents of the village the corporate authorities further find that increased parental responsibility is essential for the effective control and elimination of such juvenile offenses furthermore the corporate authorities further find that it is in the best interests of the village that such acts be prosecuted by the village as a local offense  that penalties therefore be imposed which are related to the nature of the act and the type of offender  and that parents or legal guardians of minors found guilty of such acts be held responsible for any monetary penalty or order of

requirements awaiver eligibility criteria every applicant shall provide for storm water management as required by this chapter unless this requirement is waived by the village the minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in part upon request of the applicant provided that at least one of the following conditions applies 1it can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter 2alternative minimum requirements for onsite management of storm water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the village and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance 3provisions are made to manage storm water by an offsite facility the offsite facility is required to be in place designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the storm water practice 4the village finds that meeting the minimum onsite management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site 5nonstructural practices will be used on the sites that reduce the generation of storm water from the site  the size and cost of storm water storage  and the pollutants generated at the site these nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the illinois urban manual bassurances required for waiver in instances where one of the conditions above applies the village may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water management provisions as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided however to be eligible for a variance the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterway 1deterioration of

shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old design color texture and other visual qualities and where possible materials replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence gchemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible hsignificant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation measures shall be undertaken inew additions exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing size scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment jnew additions and adjacent or related construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the property and its environment shall be unimpaired knew additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired dguidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings the following guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings are outlined in the us secretary of the interiors publication standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings standards for rehabilitation or standards these principles shall apply to historic buildings of all sizes materials occupancy and construction types whether designated as a landmark or part of a historic district please refer to standards for rehabilitation for further details which document is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or illinois law the village clerk shall at all times have at least three copies of the standards for rehabilitation on file in his or her office for public use and has had said copies on file for at least 30 days prior to the adoption of this chapter 1as stated in the definition the treatment rehabilitation assumes that at least some repair or alteration of the historic building will be needed in order to provide for an efficient contemporary use  however these repairs and alterations must not damage or destroy materials features or finishes that are important in defining the buildings historic character for example certain treatments  if improperly applied  may cause or accelerate physical deterioration of a historic building this can include using improper repainting or exterior masonry cleaning techniques or introducing insulation that damages historic fabric in almost all of these situations use of these materials and treatments will result in a project that does not meet the standards similarly exterior additions that duplicate the form material and detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the structure will fail to meet the standards 2identify retain and preserve the guidance that is basic to the treatment of all historic buildings identifying retaining and preserving the form and detailing of those architectural materials and features that are important in defining the historic character is always recommended and encouraged those actions that are most apt to cause the diminution or even loss of the buildings historic character are not recommended and are to be discouraged 3protect and maintain after identifying those materials and features that are important and must be retained in the process of rehabilitation work then protecting and maintaining them should be addressed protection generally involves the least degree of intervention and its preparatory other work 4repair when the physical condition of characterdefining materials and features warrants additional work repairing is recommended guidance for the repair of historic materials such as masonry wood and architectural metals again begins with the least degree of intervention methods repairing also includes the limited replacement in kindor with a compatible substitute materialof extensively deteriorated or missing parts of features when there are surviving prototypes although using the same kind of material is always the preferred option substitute material is acceptable if the form and design as well as the substitute material itself convey the visual appearance of the remaining parts of the feature 5replace following repair in the hierarchy guidance is provided for replacing an entire characterdefining feature with new material because the level of deterioration or damage of materials precludes repair if the essential form and detailing are still evident so that the physical evidence can be used to reestablish the feature as an integral part of the rehabilitation project then its replacement is appropriate 6design for missing historic features when an entire interior or exterior feature is missing it no longer plays a role in physically defining the historic character of the building unless it can be accurately recovered in form and detailing process of carefully documenting the historical appearance where an important architectural feature is missing its recovery is always recommended in the guidelines as the first or preferred course of action however a second acceptable option for the replacement feature is a new design that is compatible with the remaining characterdefining features of the historic building the new design should always take into account the size scale and material of the historic building itself and most importantly should be clearly differentiated so that a false historical appearance is not created 7alterationsadditions to historic buildings some exterior and interior alterations to the historic building are generally needed to assure its continued use but it is most important that such alterations do not radically change obscure or destroy character defining spaces materials features or finishes the construction of an exterior addition to a historic building should be avoided if possible and considered only after it is determined that those needs can not be met by altering secondary ie noncharacter defining interior spaces if after a thorough evaluation of interior solutions an exterior addition is still judged to be the only viable alternative it should be designed and constructed to be clearly differentiated from the historic building and so that the characterdefining features are not radically changed obscured damaged or destroyed 8health and safety code requirements  energy retrofitting work done to meet health and safety code requirements for example providing barrier free access to historic buildings  or retrofitting measures to conserve energy for example installing solar collectors in an unobtrusive location on the site is quite often an important aspect of rehabilitation projects but it is usually not part of the overall process of protecting or repairing characterdefining features rather such work is assessed for its potential negative impact on the buildings historic character for this reason particular care must be taken not to radically change obscure damage or destroy characterdefining materials or features in the process of rehabilitation work to meet code and energy requirements ecare and maintenance of designated property any property real estate or improvement that is designated as a landmark or which is within the historic preservation district whether owned or controlled privately or publicly shall receive reasonable care maintenance and upkeep appropriate for the preservation protection enhancement and perpetuation of the historic architectural and

loss for a landmark or landmark eligible structure 1if the commission determines that a denial of a certificate of appropriateness does not cause an undue economic hardship the commission may recommend to the board of trustees to postpone the alteration demolition or removal and the commission shall so notify the owner in writing during the period set forth for postponement the commission shall explore alternatives to alteration demolition or removal such alternatives may include consultation with private civic groups interested private individuals and public agencies in an effort to find a persuasive means of preserving the structure if the sale of the property is considered a feasible alternative to the owner the building must remain on the open market for six months if after a period not to exceed six months no alternative agreement has been reached with the applicant the commission shall recommend to the board that a certificate of appropriateness be issued for alteration demolition or removal of the structure in question bfor any structure existing in the historic district that is not a landmark or landmark eligible structure 1if the historic preservation commission determines that a denial of a certificate of appropriateness does not cause an undue economic hardship every effort should be made to reach a compromise with the applicant that would allow approval of
