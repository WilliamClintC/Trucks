finds that synthetic marijuana consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana with that use having become increasingly popular particularly among teens and young adults b the city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers hospitals emergency room doctors and police agencies that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions tremors seizures hallucinations unconsciousness anxiety attacks dangerously elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them c the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has

unnecessary additional structure will be required in contradiction with city policy collocation shall be required unless an applicant demonstrates that collocation is not feasible b feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed feasible for the purpose of this section where all of the following are met 1 the wireless communication provider or property owner where collocation is proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for collocation and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates 2 the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support 3 the collocation being considered is technically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure antennas and the like 7 nonconforming facilities and penalties for not permitting collocation if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect in addition if a party refuses to allow collocation in accordance with the intent of this section and this action results in construction of a new tower the city may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from that party for a period of up to five years such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals zba if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates

wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services 8 variances the zba may consider a variance from the standards of this section based upon a finding that one or more of the following factors exist as appropriate for the type of variance requested a for location the applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district or location in accordance with the standards of this section cannot reasonably meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant b for no collocation the applicant has demonstrated that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because existing structures cannot support the facility that collocation would result in unreasonable interference or that reasonable financial terms are not available for collocation c for setback the applicant has provided engineering information that documents that the tower is self collapsing and that the setback area provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails d for all the applicant has proposed means to

also recognized when several of these uses are concentrated in close proximity they begin to dominate the character of an area and create a synergy that compounds their deleterious effect on other uses special regulations of these uses are therefore necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting deteriorating andor down grading of the area and the adjacent areas these special regulations are itemized in this ordinance prior to adopting these regulations the city reviewed studies prepared on these uses reviewed ordinances and regulations prepared by other municipalities and reviewed applicable federal and state case law based on evidence of the adverse effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council
