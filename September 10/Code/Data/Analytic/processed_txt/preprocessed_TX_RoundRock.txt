subdivision ordinance 2 except as provided in vtca local government the city shall collect the fees as follows a at the time the political subdivision issues a building permit  or b for land platted outside the corporate boundaries of the city the city shall collect the impact fees at the time an application for an individual meter connection to the citys water or wastewater system is filed 3 for land on which new development occurs or is proposed to occur without platting the city may assess the impact fees at any time during the development and building process and may collect the fees at either the time of recordation of the subdivision plat or connection to the citys water or wastewater system or at the time the city issues either the building permit or the certificate of occupancy 4 following assessment of the impact fee hereunder the amount of the impact fee per service unit may not be increased above the assessed fee unless the owner obtains final approval for replatting in which case a new assessment shall occur at the assessed water and wastewater impact fee per service unit in effect at the time of such replatting 5 an application for an amended plat made pursuant to vtca local government or the citys subdivision rules is not subject to a reassessment of the impact fee h calculation of impact fees 1 the water and wastewater impact fees shall be based on the number of service units required for nonmultifamily uses or the size of the water meter determined by the director to be necessary to serve multifamily uses and the number of service units associated with that size of water meter if the city allows a development to connect to the wastewater system without connecting to the water system the director shall determine the number of service units that would be required if the development did connect to the water system the number of service units associated with the various sizes of water meters or multifamily types are set forth herein in subsection e above 2 a property owner may submit or the director may require the submission of a study prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state clearly indicating the number of water andor wastewater service units which will be consumed or generated by the new development the director will review the information for completeness and conformity with generally accepted engineering practices and may when satisfied with the completeness and conformity of the study modify the total number of service units required for the new development 3 total service units and any fraction thereof shall be multiplied by the impact fee per service unit for water or wastewater service as set forth in subsection f of this section 4 all applicable offsets credits or discounts per service unit allowable under this section for water or wastewater service shall be subtracted from the product derived under subsection h3 of this section 5 the amount of impact fees due for new development shall not exceed the amount computed by multiplying the assessed fee for water or wastewater service by the total number of service units generated by the development 6 whenever the property owner increases the number of service units for a development the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined based on the assessed fee and applicable offsets credits and discounts then in effect and such additional fee shall be collected at the time the additional meters are purchased 7 for the purpose of determining water impact fees attributable to the addition of a

contribute toward the cost of a capital improvement or facility expansion included in the adopted water or wastewater capital improvements plan the city shall provide for reimbursement in the form of credits against impact fees that would otherwise be due from the development such credits shall run with the land and shall be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be owed at the time of collection of impact fees if the amount of such credits would be insufficient to reimburse the developer for the cost of required improvements the city shall provide for reimbursement to the developer up to the balance of the cost of the required improvements from water or wastewater impact fees collected from other new development within the same service area in determining the amount of such credits the developer shall submit evidence of the actual fairmarket cost of the required improvement such credits shall only be applicable against the impact fees for the type of facility water or wastewater for which the capital improvement is made j exceptions and exemptions 1 limitation on modification except as provided in this section or by contract in existence on the

delegated the responsibility of local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage statement of purpose a it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area methods of reducing flood losses a in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands general provisions a lands to which these provisions apply this section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city b basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of special
