to minimize flood losses therefore the city council ordains this article 21   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 22   statement of purpose

with the citys latest land use projections and may include areas outside of the city limits and etj the assessment shall be performed and submitted in accordance with the stormwater design manual the results of the downstream assessment may indicate that the developer has several options as follows to address compliance with this article if none of these options are available or acceptable to the developer then onsite storage with controlled release shall be required a no impact in those instances where the downstream impact assessment demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director of public works that the proposed development causes no downstream increases in discharge or base flood elevations due to the timing of the hydrographs or that the existing downstream drainage system can convey the fully developed flows from the project without exceeding the requirements of this article or the stormwater design manual then no drainage improvements or onsite storage facilities will be required b downstream improvements when a downstream impact assessment indicates that downstream facilities do not meet the requirements of this article and the stormwater design manual the developer may provide for the proper design and construction of downstream drainage improvements rather than construct onsite storage facilities to properly mitigate the effects of additional runoff alternatively where a downstream drainage improvement project has already been identified and analyzed by the city with the permission of the director of public works a developer may participate in the project cost of such downstream improvements to satisfy the requirements of this section financial participation may include a portion or all of the city drainage project cost andor the cost of drainage easement acquisition for the citys benefit the amount of financial participation by the developer shall be determined using an acceptable engineers opinion of the probable construction cost necessary to meet the ordinance requirements for onsite storage and release plus engineering design fees and cost of payment performance and maintenance bonds c participation in regional detention the

compatible if they do not result in a gathering of individuals in an area that would result in an average density of greater than 25 persons per acre per hour during a 24hour period not to exceed 50 persons per acre at any time the following is a reproduction of appendix f volume h of the 1992 aicuz study for sheppard air force base and is included here for ease of reference average density average densities of persons per hour during a 24hour period are determined by calculating the number of persons per acre expected on a site multiplying by the number of hour they will be on the site and dividing the total by 24 example #1 one 8hour shift of 30 workers on a one acre site avg density   30 persons expected  8 hours on site   240 then 24024 10 thus avg density   10 persons per hour per 24hour period example #2 two 8hour shifts of 30 workers on a one acre site avg density   30 persons expected  16 hours on site   480 then 48024 20 thus avg density   20 persons per acre per hour per a 24hour period maximum density the maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour is calculated by dividing the number of hours persons will be on site by 24 hours and then dividing by 25 persons per acre per hour by the result the resulting number is the maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour provided it does not exceed 50 fifty persons per acre at any one time is the maximum number of persons allowed under the standard example maximum density for two eighthour shifts on a one acre site 25 divided by 1624   375 persons per hour allowed application of this formula results in the following table which specifies the maximum persons per acre per hour for the duration of the time that persons are expected to be on site during a 24hour period persons per acre hours of operation per day maximum persons allowed per acre during each hour 24 25 23 26 22 27 21 28 20 30 19 31 18 33 17 35 16 37 15 40 14 42 13 46 12 or less 50 note fractions in the maximum persons allowed column are rounded to the lowest whole number note also note that concentrations of people may not exceed 50 peopleunit per acre at any time  372000   442000   18 432001   272006 6500
