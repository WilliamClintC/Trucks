water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city commission does ordain as follows in this chapter b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase

plan expanding the educational program and following the guidelines and information provided by the texas water development board twdb j the best management practices bmps all or part that will be included in the citys water conservation plan includes mandatory elements such as metering system water audit retrofit bmps school educational programs and prohibition of wasting water   a 8162016 goals a the citys water conservation plan objectives are to improve the efficiency of water use techniques that will reduce water consumption reduce summertime usage especially during dry weather reduce water loss and increase water reuse b it is also the goal of the city to expand and improve the water conservation plan to achieve a one percent reduction per year in total gallons per capita per day gpcd over the next five and tenyear periods the one percent reduction per year is recommended by the state water conservation implementation task force c the city has been proactive in water conservation as the citys consumption of 82 gpcd in 200 77 gpcd in 2007 and 73 gpcd in 2008 reflected a reduction of nine gpcd this reduction exceeds the one percent recommended reduction d the reduction in per capita consumption is a result of a combination of conservation efforts including the citys accounting program water system inspection program the water meter program system repairs and public education e the five and tenyear gpcd target goals are shown in table 1 table 1 water consumption goals based on gallons per capita per day gpcd actual target goals year 2004 2008 2008 2013

have been developed and utilized by the city to improve water use efficiency and for programs to assist and improve the citys water customers in the efficient use of water b bmps that are presently in effect and some that will be considered for implementation are described in this section and in greater detail in this article c the system water audits and water loss bmp allows the citys utility section to reliably track water use and provide the information needed to address unnecessary water and revenue losses the metering of all new connections bmp has established to create equity among customers reduce water waste and reduce flows to wastewater facilities the city currently does not have a retrofit program in place at this time but will work toward establishing a retrofit program the city is responsible for the inside inspection of all residential and commercial structures the water conservation pricing bmp is designed to discourage the wasting of water while ensuring the fiscal obligations of the system are met the prohibition of wasting water bmp is aimed at customers who continue to waste water despite water utility efforts to educate customers to reduce the wasting of water d the public information bmp affects water consumption in behavior as customers learn about water resources the wise use of water and the conservation program the waterwise landscape design program bmp saves water installation of waterwise landscape material supplemented with education to ensure efficient irrigation of new and existing landscapes  system water audit and water loss a to maximize the benefits of this bmp the city uses the information from the water audit to revise meter testing and repair practices reduce unauthorized water use improve accounting for authorized but unbilled water and implement effective water loss management strategies state law requires a retail public utility providing potable water to perform and file with the twdb every five years a water audit computing its most recent annual audit system water lost the city will explore the implementation of a more frequent water auditing and loss reduction by conducting an annual audit of the system b the city already tracks water loss by their leak detection program leak repair meter change out and water use by the city except for the tennis court all city facilities are presently being metered leak detection consists of utilizing the citys leak detection crews to monitor older water mains and connections and to continuously monitor water mains especially in areas of heavy traffic constant monitoring of storage tank levels daily visual inspection monitoring distribution pressure and flows monitoring for illegal connections and educate and inform water customers to report any and all leaks promptly c the city has completed the texas water development boards utility profile form wrd264 and will utilize this information in the completion of their annual water audit d in accordance with state law the city will improve and refine their system water audit and water loss by utilizing information and assistance from the twdb 1 monthly water pumpage records from the city of houstons 96inch distribution line water well plants and monthly total water billing records will be compiled for each water service area wastewater flow records from the wastewater treatment plant will be maintained on a monthly basis 2 existing maintenance and repair records will be compiled and improved  this information may be used to track water loss from water leaks 3 comparisons of the pumpage versus billed water will be made to identify potential water loss or accountability 4 potential ideas for water reuse will be evaluated the city does not have a golf course but the wastewater treatment plant uses the plant effluent to operate the chlorinators and for plant washdown e the city will provide a more detailed overall picture of water losses by using existing records by improving overall accountability f to track this bmp the city will collect assemble and maintain the following 1 prepare an annual audit reflecting percentage water losses and actions implemented to address data and recommendations generated by the annual audit 2 leak detection work orders will be maintained reflecting all leak repairs as to location number of leaks repaired size of line and estimated water loss the city can take advantage of the twdbs leak detection equipment 3 number of customer service line leaks line size estimated water loss and actions taken to repair these leaks 4 additional revenue generated by initiating this bmp  metering bmp a the city has a meter replacement program in place and in addition to the meter section the city also employs the services of an outside meter contractor each year or more often if necessary the contractor checks and calibrates the meters at plants 1 and 2 which meters the surface water from the city of houstons 96inch surface water distribution line and the water well meters meter calibration ensures that the city will receive the maximum savings on water received from the city of houston and water pumped from the wells b all metering and meter calibrations are within an accuracy of plus or minus five percent c the citys metering program consists of the following 1 the citys present goal is to replace 100 meters each year in some cases it is more economical to replace meters than to repair them 2 an effective monthly meterreading program in which readings are estimated only in cases of an inoperable meter or other extenuating circumstances  broken or inaccurate meters are replaced as soon as possible depending on available staff 3 meter readers fill out work orders on meters that appear to have irregularities or are broken or damaged 4 the water accounting section flags water bills that appear to be too high or too low 5 construction meters are used to track water usage in the construction industry 6 all city facilities are presently being metered except for one tennis court 7 implementation of the state requirements in texas water which requires all new townhouses and apartments be either directly metered by the utility or submetered by the owner 8 an accounting of water savings and revenue gains implementation of the citys water meter repair and replacement procedures d the city will ensure that the meter program is maintained regular review of metered data and revision of metering policies to ensure that the maximum amount of water consumption is accounted for e to track the effectiveness of the metering bmp the city will provide the following 1 number and size of water meters replaced on an annual basis 2 number and size of water meter repaired annually 3 number of meters tested and results of each 4 estimate of water savings achieved repair and replacement program 5 number of work orders generated for meter repairreplacement f every year the city will estimate its annual water saving from the meter bmp and from records generated by the water accounting section and meter replacement section the city will look into the monitoring water accountability on a monthly basis and maintain a running 12month average for water loss  water conservation pricing a this bmp is intended for all utilities wishing to send price signals to customers to encourage water conservation water conservation pricing discourages the inefficient use or waste of water the goal of conservation pricing is to develop longterm consumption patterns consistent with cost the city will educate their customers on the type of rate structure that the utility uses and can be provided feedback water bill on their monthly water use b the city has a water and sewer rate structure that includes a progressive scale for one family units and for increases in meter sizes up to six inches which provides for service and billing for water and wastewater service based on the actual metered water use the rates include a consumption charge based on actual gallons metered so that increasing water consumption results in a larger bill for the customer c the city raised water rates and anticipates that conservation pricing will have the advantage of providing stronger feedback to the customers who will see a larger percent increase in their water bill than the increase in water use the rate structure is not presently shown on the customers water bill but the city will explore this option d the increase in water rates has shown that conservation pricing has provided incentives to customers to reduce average andor peak use e the city will consider requiring new commercial and industrial customers to install separate irrigation meters and the feasibility of retrofitting current commercial and industrial customers with irrigation meters f the city will review the consumption patterns including seasonal use and its income and expense levels to determine if the conservation rates are effective and make appropriate regular rate structure adjustments as needed g to track this bmp the city should maintain the following documentation 1 a copy of the citys water and wastewater rate ordinance 2 customer numbers and water consumption by customer class at the beginning and end of the reporting period 3 a copy of the education materials sent to customers for each calendar year 4 a utility bill as stated above 5 a utility bill reflecting water conservation information h elasticity studies have shown an average reduction in water use of one to three percent for every ten percent increase in the average monthly water bill in implementing a conservation pricing structure consideration will be given to the factors that influence whether the new structure results in a reduction in water use the water price elasticities for singlefamily homes in texas study included several findings which suggest some water savings can be expected as follows 1 average price is better than marginal price in explaining the quantity of water demanded by customers 2 customers do not understand the link between water use and sewer billing and therefore do not tend to factor sewer prices into their water use decisions 3 the study found that for a ten percent increase in price there was a two percent reduction in water use  prohibition on wasting water a this bmp should be considered by utilities that have customers who continue to waste water despite the efforts of the utility to educate customers to reduce the waste of water water waste prohibition measures are enforceable actions and measures that prohibit specific wasteful activities under this bmp the city has enforcement powers to prohibit wasteful activities including 1 failure to fix outside faucet leaks 2 failure to repair service line leaks customers side 3 failure to repair personal water lines faucets water closets and water heaters 4 allowing sprinklers and water hoses to run during rainy conditions 5 operating irrigation systems with missing heads and leaks 6 leaks and water loss from car washes and commercial laundry systems b the bmp is implemented by the regular maintenance and operating personnel of the city and work orders are written on all leaks and repaired by work crews who are available on a 24hour basis c to track this bmp the city will maintain the following documentation 1 copy of water waste prohibition ordinances enacted in the service area 2 copy of compliance or enforcement procedures implemented by the city 3 records of enforcement actions including public complaints of violations and utility response 4 records of all work orders 5 record estimated water loss from each area d total water savings for this bmp can be estimated from each waterwasting measure eliminated actions taken under this bmp there will be additional savings from the education of customers who may change some of their inefficient water usage practices the city will explore other avenues and additional methods to improve this program  residential toilet replacement program a this bmp is intended for a municipal water utility that has at least 20 percent of homes and apartment units in the service area constructed prior to 1995 and for which there has not been an active retrofit program to replace high flush volume toilets with 16 gallons per flush gpf toilets b state and federal requirements prohibit installation of new toilets using more than 16 gpf in singlefamily and multifamily residences the implementation of this bmp will consist of the following 1 a retrofit mandate for all new structures and existing structures undergoing substantial modification or additions the buyer and seller certify that the plumbing fixtures meet the efficiency standards of the most recent plumbing code 2 the citys water and wastewater department has its own inspector and can expand on the retrofit program 3 a retrofit requirement andor ordinance triggered when ownership of the property changes the city will require all plumbing fixtures in the singlefamily or multifamily unit leased property and rental property to meet current plumbing standards when new structures and existing structures undergo substantial modification or additions 4 as time permits the city could set up a system to inspect all singlefamily and multifamily units and ensure that all conform to the current plumbing codes c the following proposed schedule will be implemented 1 the inspectors will prepare documentation on all inspections on all singlefamily residences and multifamily units that are rented leased or if ownership of the property changes  the documentation will reflect the kind and number of units replaced and installation completion date 2 a plan will be developed to educate homeowners apartment owners and managers plumbers and realtors about this program 3 the city will strive to improve the implementation and expansion of the retrofit program d to track this bmp the city should gather the following 1 the number of ultra low flushing toilet ulft installations credited to the participants replacement program by year including brand and model of toilets installed 2 the average persons per household for singlefamily residences and the average person per household for multifamily units 3 description of ulft replacement program 4 estimated water savings per ulft replacement e the city will continue to educate homeowners multiunit owners managers plumbers and realtors about this program and work toward developing a compliance program  public information a a program for providing water conservation information to the public is an effective means of both promoting specific water conservation programs and practices and educating the public about the importance of using water efficiently b public information programs can result in both short and longterm water savings though they may not be directly related to any equipment or operational change behavioral changes by customers will only occur if a reasonable yet compelling case can be presented with sufficient frequency to be recognized and absorbed by customers c one of the goals is to educate customers of the overall picture of water resources in the community and how conservation is needed to meet the goals of managing and sustaining existing water supplies and to avoid or delay building new facilities an equally important part of the program is to provide data and information on specific actions and measures the customers should take to implement these community goals when customers know the results of their actions have made a difference they are encouraged to continue participation in conservation efforts d there are a variety of tools that can be effectively used to communicate water conservation by means of public education these include use of print radio television billboards board meetings schools direct distribution of materials and facility tours e school education will be addressed in the school education section f the city utilizes the following to inform the public the importance of water conservation and the value of water in sustaining and enhancing life 1 public at large  the city holds regular meetings of the commission every month which are open to the public  anyone is free to speak to the commission and the commission can inform the public about water conservation and make recommendations and decisions regarding conservation 2 posted at city hall water conservation information available and posted at city hall 3 printed brochures  state water development board water conservation literature and pamphlets will be part of the basis for information to the public as well as preprinted brochures available from the waterwise council of texas there are many publications brochures videos dvds etc already available on water conservation that can be used as published or modified to meet the goals of the utility such as water iq know your water  the following brochures were developed by the water conservation task force be water smart indoors be waterwise outdoors and top water smart tips in and around the home other twdb brochures are water conserving tips conserving water outdoors and conserving water indoors the water lily press inc local has a wide variety of brochures and material on water conservation brochures also available are published by the texas waterwise council a publicprivate partnership that fosters awareness and implementation of sound water management a few of the brochures that are available are irrigationbest management practices lawn maintenancebest management practice and landscapebest management practice 4 inserts in utility bills and local papers the city will begin using inserts and messages with utility billing on a regular basis and can also publish water conservation messages in the local paper 5 leak detection kits the city will order leak detection kits along with other information and make them available at city hall 6 tours of water utilities facilities tours of the water utilities facilities are also available to the public g the goal of the city at a minimum is to provide information to each customer at least twice each year on each action that the utility would like the customer to take to track the progress of this bmp the city gathers the following data 1 the number of brochures and information distributed to the public 2 number of dye kits distributed to the public 3 number of water bills with water conservation information included 4 number of public school children who received information on water conservation 5 number of persons who toured the citys utilities 6 the total population of the city is 10998 2008 per twdb projection 7 results of an annual or biannual customer survey h water savings due to public information efforts are difficult to quantify water savings for other public information programs that result in specific actions by customers such as changes in irrigation scheduling or reduction in water waste occurrences could also be quantified or analysis of water waste reporting  school education a lessons learned by students about good water use habits are often shared with the whole family b school education programs which may not result in quantifiable water savings will improve and enhance a utilitys public image increase customer good will and increase the viability of its overall water conservation efforts the message conveyed by students to their families is based upon greater knowledge that water sources and conservation can result in behavioral changes resulting in both short and longterm water savings c the city will explore the possibility of sponsoring the waterwise program which educates the students in the fourth grade on water conservation and supply the waterwise program is a product of the harris galveston subsidence district and information and materials are available district the water conservations kits furnished to the students consist of toilet leak detection tablets showerhead and faucet aerators water displacement bags and instructions on repairing toilet leaks and other common water leaks d the city can purchase the water conservation kits subsidence district and receive credit for 84000 gallons of well water for each kit purchased the subsidence district will assist the city in initiating this program at the local schools e a study by the harris galveston subsidence district found an average savings of 18 percent or 1400 gallons per month in homes where parents of students had installed efficient showerheads and aerators on bathroom and kitchen sinks f the city will strive to improve their school education program by obtaining water conservation education literature from the state water development board such as their sixth grade curriculum called raising your water iq as well as water conservation lesson plans g the program will require utility staff oversight and outreach efforts to schools and students the city will track this bmp by 1 number of students participating in the water conservation plan 2 number of water conservation kits furnished to the classrooms 3 number of presentations made during the year 4 grade level and data the program expanded h a true costeffectiveness analysis cannot be determined without a measure of water savings the program conducted by the harris galveston subsidence district found that 1400 gallons per month were saved by installing water savings devices in the home  waterwise landscape design and conservation program a this bmp is intended for utility customers who have high water use landscapes which consume more than twice as much water in the summer as in the winter a utility impacted by repeated drought may also consider this bmp as a means of reducing outdoor water demand overall in their service area as a step toward longterm change of water use patterns b the city will realize a decrease in summertime water consumption peak pumpage and overall use by the installation of waterwise landscapes at residential properties city properties and subsequent education to ensure efficient irrigation of the new landscapes waterwise landscaping involves not only plant selection but continued attention to appropriate irrigation and landscape maintenance c in addition a public education and outreach program wise brochures local media water bills civic groups garden clubs and nurseries will help create a program that will bring waterwise landscape design to residential and commercial customers d the city will explore the feasibility of initiating a landscape program which would require the use of droughttolerant and lowwater use landscaping species on all new homes e in the typical landscape turf grass occupies the largest area and when managed incorrectly receives the largest amount of irrigation water savings can be achieved by installation of practical turf areas and irrigation of only the turf in high impact highly visible areas of the landscape irrigated turf areas should be reduced or eliminated as part of the conservation program f the city and the citys parks department are committed to installing waterwise plants and landscapes at all city facilities g waterwise landscape programs follow the seven principles of xeriscape from the texas a&m horticulture department which are planning and design soil analysis and improvement appropriate plant selection practical turf areas efficient irrigation use of mulches and appropriated maintenance h the implementation of this bmp involves continual public education campaigns including publicprivate partnerships with gardening clubs landscape designers and nurseries i the city will try to establish and continue with an ongoing public outreach and educational campaign and the following information would be provided 1 landscape improvementbest management practices a brochure developed by the waterwise council of texas covers soil improvement mulch maintenance mowing and efficient irrigation 2 water iqbe waterwise outdoors a brochure available from the state water development board that details waterwise steps to follow waterwise landscape watering waterwise landscape maintenance waterwise irrigation equipment and design a waterwise landscape 3 xeriscapelandscape with less water a brochure that details the seven principles of xeriscaping 4 outreach continue implementation and outreach program to the public nurseries realtors and landscape companies 5 rain sensors the city will explore the requirement of rain sensors on all automated irrigation systems and the potential to save water 6 evapotranspiration controllers ets the city will explore the feasibility of requiring et controllers on all new and reconditioned irrigation systems j to track this bmp the city will gather the following documentation 1 number of dedicated irrigation meter accounts 2 estimated water savings based on customer billing records 3 customer water use records prior to and after conversion of the landscape  this data is best compared in years of similar rainfall and after the landscape has been installed a sufficient time to establish itself 4 number of rain sensors and et controllers on automatic sprinkler systems and customer records prior to and after installation of such devices  this data is best compared in years of similar rainfall and after the landscape has been installed a sufficient time to establish itself k water savings will be determined from analysis of actual customermetered water use before and after landscape conversion and after installation of rain sensors or et controllers  park conservation a this bmp is intended for all utilities which manage parks or serve customers with parks which consume water the visible use of water often comes under scrutiny by the public and water utility staff because of large water demand to maintain a park and because of the perception that the water use may be excessive b the city has six public parks five athletic fields and one tennis court that require water the city also has one public swimming pool c park irrigation conservation practices as well as the careful use of water in operation and maintenance of park facilities can effectively reduce water demands under this bmp the city will require the management of the parks to comply with the water conservation programs on prohibition of wasting water and waterwise landscape design d under the plan the park supervisor will implement a watering regiment that uses only the amounts of water necessary to maintain the viability of turf and landscape material appropriate for the use of the park water should only be applied to areas that are essential to the use of the park e conservation of water for the parks will be achieved on prohibition of wasting water waterwise landscape design and system water audit and loss program f four of the athletic fields are on one meter and the fifth field is metered individually which gives the city a good way to track water loss the city will explore the metering of each athletic field g one of the six parks is metered and has water service  the other five parks do not have water service h as a minimum compliance with this bmp will require the replacement of all manually controlled or quick couple irrigation systems with automatic irrigation systems and controllers i water wasting practices during ball field irrigation will be eliminated including water running in gutters irrigation heads or sprinkler spraying directly on paved surfaces operation of automatic irrigation systems without a functioning rain shutoff device operation of an irrigation system with missing or broken heads and irrigation during summer months should be restricted to special times j to accomplish this bmp the city will 1 ensure that the landscapes of all park properties are planted and irrigated in compliance with waterwise landscape design requirements 2 offer training for park irrigation management and as part of this training should include workshops on pesticides soil and nutrient management for optimal water use efficiency 3 the water usage for the parks is metered and included in the system audit and loss program k to track the progress of this bmp the city will gather the following documentation 1 metered water readings before and after any changes are implemented 2 changes to irrigation systems retrofits or upgrades regular leak detections and maintenance policies and estimated water savings from conservation practices 3 cost of repairs equipment upgrades or new equipment installed l estimating total water savings for this bmp may be difficult  however water savings can be estimated from each waterwasting measure eliminated actions taken under this bmp 1 swimming pool facilities a all swimming pool facilities should be equipped with recirculation and chlorination equipment while not common there are pools that are filled and drained everyday with potable water which practice should be discontinued overflow drains should be pumped back to the recirculation system swimming pools should be managed to minimize operational losses due to evaporation splashing and filter backwashing proper design optimal backwash scheduling and use of a pool cover can help limit all of these losses regular maintenance during the off season should include testing for water loss and leak repair b pool facilities and buildings should be swept for regular sanitary purposes and only cleaned with the amounts of water needed for human health and safety purposes showerheads faucets and toilets in the swimming pool facilities should be retrofitted with efficient fixtures 2 implementation a the city will ensure that the swimming pool facility supervisor is well trained in the operation and maintenance of the facility as well as the water conservation plan b the swimming pool facility supervisor should develop written water conservation policies and procedures that cover the operation and maintenance of the pool and related facilities the policy and procedures will include employees c the swimming pool and related facilities will be metered to track water use water loss and to reinforce the importance of water use efficiency d the city will follow and track the recommendations and water conservation items listed in subsection l1 of this section  reuse of reclaimed water a generally the direct use of reclaimed water is an effective method of reducing potable water usage the term reclaimed water is defined in the texas administrative tac as domestic or municipal wastewater which has been treated to a quality suitable for a beneficial use pursuant to the provisions of this article and other applicable rules and permits direct use of reclaimed water is appropriated for a number of domestic industrial and irrigation needs where the potential for human contact is limited b direct use of reclaimed water direct use of reclaimed water is regulated by the texas commission on environmental quality tceq and safe drinking water act standards included in these rules are provisions that require permission from that agency before providing reclaimed water for beneficial use and design guidelines for reclaimed water systems c implementation implementation consists of the following 1 the city is presently using the wastewater effluent to operate the plant chlorination equipment and for plant washdown 2 the city does not have the industrial or commercial customer base to consider the expense of installing a separate water reuse water system  however the city will explore the long range possibilities of additional water reuse as the costs and demand for potable water continues to increase d documentation  1 the wastewater treatment plant is a 095 mgd complete mix activated sludge treatment process 2 the wastewater effluent is being used in the operation of the chlorination equipment and for plant washdown the plant effluent usage is being estimated but escape accountability will be refined 3 number of gallons or acrefeet of previous potable water use replaced by reuse water since the implementation of the bmp e determination of water savings  water savings are estimated at up to 100 percent of the total amount of potable water replaced by reclaimed water changes in operating parameters or water balance calculations which depend upon water quality parameters such as the impact of total dissolved solids tds in irrigation water require different quantities of reused water to be applied for sameend uses  coordination with
