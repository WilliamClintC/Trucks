subscriber to an mcs provider the minimum amount required to be paid to avoid disconnection and the date and place where such payment must be made d disconnection of service must occur both on a normal service day and within normal business hours of an mcs provider unless the subscriber is given the opportunity to pay the full amount of the past due account e an mcs provider who physically retrieves its equipment including converter remote control unit or digital audio tuner from a subscriber must do so within both a normal service day and normal service hours of an mcs provider f receipt of a bad check from a subscriber in response to a written notice of disconnection does not constitute payment and the affected mcs provider need not give the subscriber further notice prior to disconnecting multichannel service g an mcs provider may add a reasonable collection charge to the subscribers bill if the applicable provisions of this chapter and any applicable state regulations are followed h unless authorized by the subscriber an mcs provider shall not apply a security deposit on the rental or lease of a specific piece of equipment in order to satisfy a subscribers past due or delinquent account i any refund due a subscriber after such a disconnection shall be made within 60 days of the disconnection for nonpayment  92192 voluntary disconnections and downgrades a at any time a subscriber may request that a particular service tier service cluster pay channel premium channel informational service or the entire multichannel service be disconnected b where provided by an mcs provider a subscriber may request a downgrade from a particular level of service to a less comprehensive level of service or a less expensive level of service c from the date that such a subscriber makes such a request for either a disconnection or downgrade then the mcs provider shall have 72 hours or three service days whichever is longer to disconnect or downgrade the service tier pay channel premium channel informational service or entire multichannel service if an mcs provider does not disconnect or downgrade service within 72 hours a subscribers obligation to pay for such service shall cease or in the case of a downgrade a subscribers obligation to pay for the more comprehensive andor higher priced service shall cease d for a service cluster premium channel or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected a subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such service cluster premium channel or informational service e no separate disconnect or downgrade charge may be passed on to a subscriber if the subscriber chooses to take advantage of a lowerpriced service tiercluster or an optional service tiercluster however to prevent subscriber abuse of this voluntary disconnection or downgrade policy a subscriber shall be charged a minimum one months full rate for any one service tiercluster which is disconnected andor downgraded at least three times within a span of 180 days f if however an mcs providers equipment is or has been damaged by a subscriber prior to such disconnection then the mcs provider may charge the subscriber with the entire cost for such damage provided that the mcs provider notifies the subscriber within ten days of the disconnection a subscriber shall not be required to pay for equipment failure if the circumstances fall within the normal wear and tear guidelines established in this chapter g any refund due a subscriber after disconnection both for nonpayment and voluntary shall be made within 60 days after such disconnection h in no event will this section be viewed as abridging the rights and remedies afforded by the subscriber complaintinquiry resolution process outlined in this chapter  92192 protection of subscriber privacy a an mcs provider shall abide by any and all subscriber privacy rules or regulations of the federal or state governments b for mcs providers classified as cable operators such operators shall also abide by and comply with any subscriber privacy protection requirements and procedures listed in section 631 of the ccpa codified at 47 usc 551  92192 resolution of complaintsinquiries a an mcs provider is required to develop a comprehensive complaintinquiry resolution policy that is consistent with the rules and regulations outlined in this chapter b an mcs providers complaintinquiry resolution policy shall be reduced to writing and such policy shall be available upon request to any person in any event a subscriber shall receive notice of such policy in the method that is prescribed by this chapter c the commissionfranchising authority shall establish a neutral thirdparty appeal process to handle complaintsinquiries that are not satisfactorily resolved at the mcs provider level d an mcs providers complaintinquiry resolution policy shall contain at least the following minimal standards 1 the initial response to a complaintinquiry shall occur no later than 24 hours after receipt of the complaintinquiry  2 every attempt will be made to resolve the complaintinquiry within 72 hours after receipt of the complaintinquiry  3 complaintsinquiries that fall into the category of service inquiries shall abide by the procedure set forth in this chapter  4 informing subscribers of the creditrefund policy which is consistent with this chapter and any applicable state regulations  and 5 informing subscribers of the billing disputes policy which is consistent with this chapter and any applicable state regulations  92192 policy with respect to continuity of multichannel service provisions a the commissionfranchising authority declares that as part of its right to establish multichannel customer service guidelines it has the duty to ensure continuity of multichannel service for all subscribers in that light the commissionfranchising authority also determines that it may take appropriate measures in order to ensure that no portion of the city is threatened or faced with a disruption interruption or discontinuance of multichannel service due to the actions of any mcs provider b in addition to the principles and ideals enumerated in subsection a of this section the commissionfranchising authority also expresses that its policy covers the following 1 providing for continuity of multichannel service upon acquisition by the city  2 providing for continuity of service in the event of a proposed abandonment withdrawal or cessation of multichannel service by an mcs provider  3 providing for continuity of service in the event of revocation termination or nonrenewal of a franchised mcs providers franchise  4 providing for continuity of service if a transaction occurs that affects the ownership or control of the mcs provider such as an assignment sale transfer or merger  5 providing for continuity of service upon an expiration of a franchise  6 preventing disruption of multichannel service which would provide a hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multichannel system as their primary or secondary source for information  and 7 preventing the interruption or cessation of multichannel service which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming choices enjoyed by subscribers of a multichannel system and thereby restricting their ability to receive information c whenever any situation occurs including those mentioned above which threatens the city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multichannel service then the commissionfranchising authority may direct the mcs provider for a period of up to 24 months to do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted multichannel service of the same quality mix and level regardless of the circumstances d during the interim period the commissionfranchising authority shall work with the mcs provider in order to secure a new multichannel system owner or rectify the problem so that the threat of loss of continuity is removed at the earliest possible instance e during any interim period in which the mcs provider continues to provide multichannel service to subscribers the mcs provider is entitled to all revenues collected except any sums owed including franchise fees alternative user charges and taxes to the city or to other persons f if the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved within 24 months the commissionfranchising authority may extend the interim period on a monthtomonth basis until the situation is satisfactorily resolved also in such a circumstance the commissionfranchising authority may adopt any emergency rules or procedures which will ensure that the subscribers will receive continuous uninterrupted multichannel service of the same quality mix and level  92192 continued use of individual antennas protected a the commissionfranchising authority does not intend to prohibit the erection or continued use of individual television antennas within the city so long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all applicable zoning andor land use regulations consequently no person shall be required to receive multichannel service or to physically connect to a multichannel system b it is also noted that no person shall be penalized or fined a home sales contract deed of restrictive covenants or other type of agreement for failing or refusing to receive multichannel service or physically connecting to a multichannel system  92192 periodic multichannel subscriber surveys a at least every three years after the adoption of this chapter the city and any affected mcs provider shall conduct a survey of current subscribers of that particular mcs provider in order to ascertain the degree of customer satisfaction with the subscriber sensitive aspects of the multichannel system including but not limited to billing practices response times programming choices available and receivable responsiveness to inquiries and use availability and accessibility of any customer service office b if the survey results indicate or demonstrate that the customer service practices set forth in this chapter are not sufficient to meet reasonable or identified projected city needs the commissionfranchising authority may take whatever measures are appropriate in order to rectify the deficiency or insufficiency in a particular customer service practice by one or more mcs providers  92192 construction schedule and constructionrelated requirements in order to establish minimum uniform standards the commissionfranchising authority requires any mcs provider to adopt the following minimal construction schedule and constructionrelated requirements 1 construct install maintain and repair the multichannel system in accordance with the requirements noted in this chapter  2 use streets and public ways as set forth in this chapter  3 where applicable remove franchise property from public streets as set forth in this chapter  4 adopt the construction standards as set forth in this chapter  5 adopt the system expansion standards as set forth in this chapter  6 adopt the construction schedule as referred to in this chapter  7 abide by and act in strict accordance with all current technical codes adopted by the city or the state or the united states as noted in this chapter  and 8 maintain all permits and licenses as noted in this chapter  92192 construction of good quality during any phase of construction installation maintenance and repair of the multichannel system the mcs provider shall use materials of good and durable quality and all such work shall be performed in a safe thorough and reliable manner  92192 conditions on use of streets and public ways a all wires conduits cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent and other property and facilities of an mcs provider shall be so located constructed installed and maintained so as not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with usual and customary use traffic and travel upon the streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city b if an mcs providers system creates a hazardous or unsafe condition or an unreasonable interference with property at its own expense such mcs provider shall voluntarily or upon the request of the commissionfranchising authority remove that part of the system that creates the hazardous condition from the subject property c an mcs provider shall not place equipment where it will interfere with the rights of property owners or with gas electric or telephone fixtures or with water hydrants or mains or with wastewater lift stations or any other service or facility that benefits the citys or its residents health safety or welfare d an mcs provider at either its own expense or that of a private contractor shall protect rightsofway and easements and support or temporarily disconnect or relocate in the same street or other public way any property of such mcs provider when necessitated by reason of 1 traffic conditions  2 public safety  3 a street closing  4 street construction or resurfacing  5 change or establishment of street grade  6 installation of sewers drains water pipes storm drains lift stations force mains power or signal lines  or 7 any improvement construction or repair related to the citys or its residents health safety or welfare e it shall be the responsibility of an mcs provider acting alone or in conjunction with another person to locate and mark or otherwise visibly indicate and alert others to the location of its underground cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent before employees agents or independent contractors of an mcs provider install cable in the markedoff area f an mcs provider shall on the request of any person holding a building moving permit temporarily remove raise or lower the cable wires to allow the moving of the building the expense of temporary removal shall be paid by the person requesting it and such mcs provider may require payment in advance the affected mcs provider shall be given not less than 15 days notice of a contemplated move to arrange for temporary wire changes g for any new installations occurring after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived and at the time that an mcs provider rebuilds or upgrades the multichannel system all trunk or feeder cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent shall be placed underground further where both power and utilities are presently underground multichannel system cable shall be placed underground also  92192 duty to remove franchised properties from the public streets a this section is applicable to any mcs provider required to maintain a franchise to operate within the city b whenever the following occurs 1 a franchised mcs provider ceases to operate all or part of the multichannel system for a continuous period of six months  2 a franchised mcs provider ceases and fails to construct the multichannel system outlined in the application or proposal for renewal or renewal franchise agreement  3 the commissionfranchising authority elects not to renew the franchise pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter  or 4 the franchised mcs providers franchise is revoked pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter then unless the city or another mcs provider uses such multichannel system under the continuity provisions outlined in this chapter the affected franchised mcs provider shall promptly remove its multichannel system property from the streets public ways and private property located within the city c if not removed voluntarily by a franchised mcs provider the commissionfranchising authority may notify such franchised mcs provider that if removal of the property is not accommodated within 270 days or substantial progress towards removal is not made within 210 days then the commissionfranchising authority may order officials or representatives of the city to remove such franchised mcs providers system property at that franchised mcs providers expense the performance andor construction bond irrevocable letter of credit cash deposit or full faith and credit guarantee required as set forth in this chapter shall be available to pay for such work d if officials or representatives of the city remove a franchised mcs providers system property and such franchised mcs provider does not claim the property within 90 days of its removal then the commissionfranchising authority may take whatever steps are available under state law to declare the property surplus and sell it e when such franchised mcs provider removes its multichannel system property from the streets public ways and private property located within the city the franchised mcs provider shall at its own expense and in a manner approved by the commissionfranchising authority replace and restore such public or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing the disturbance was done  92192 construction standards methods of construction installation maintenance and repair of any multichannel system shall comply with the most current editions of the national electrical safety the national electrical as affects the construction installation and maintenance of electrical supply and communication lines attachments and supports to the extent that these are inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise or state or local law then the more stringent shall govern in order to protect the public health safety and welfare  92192 system construction schedule for franchised mcs providers a this section is applicable to any mcs provider required to maintain a franchise to operate within the city b a franchised mcs providers construction schedule for the multichannel system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a form and format determined by the commissionfranchising authority c a franchised mcs provider who does not abide by the system construction schedule shall be subject to the penalties set forth in this chapter as well as being subjected to any liquidated damages if permitted and set forth in the franchise agreement  92192 system expansion for mcs providers including provision for universal service a at a minimum an mcs provider shall extend multichannel service to any area within the city that has a density of eight homes or building passings per mile or fractional equivalent thereof also in such case a newly installed subscriber shall not be assessed or apportioned the cost for installation except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers so long as the system expansion is technically feasible b in conjunction with the minimum density standards the commissionfranchising authority recognizes that one of its primary purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest diversity of programming sources is available to the greatest number of residents moreover it is the desire of the commissionfranchising authority that an mcs provider to the greatest extent possible shall not charge assess or apportion a newly installed subscriber the costs for installation except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers therefore notwithstanding any minimum density standards detailed in this chapter any franchised mcs provider shall submit within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section was derived or 45 days from the date that a franchised agreement initial or renewal becomes effective whichever is later a comprehensive plan for extending the provision of multichannel service to all residents andor potential subscribers that reside within the city c at a minimum such a comprehensive plan shall include the following 1 the construction schedule for providing multichannel service to areas within the city that are below the minimum service densities that are detailed in subsection a of this section  2 any costs fees or charges and their amounts that are to be borne by a potential subscriber who seeks the provision of multichannel service to a residence andor building that lies outside the minimum service densities detailed in subsection a of this section  and 3 the procedure for extending service to any area of the city that may be annexed in the future and which might be below the minimum service densities detailed in subsection a of this section d after submission of the comprehensive plan the commissionfranchising authority shall have up to 60 days in which to review the comprehensive plan within that 60day time frame the commissionfranchising authority has the power to approve modify or deny the comprehensive plan e if the commissionfranchising authority chooses to either modify or deny the comprehensive plan for extending service then this commissionfranchising authority must 1 detail its reasons in writing for the denial or extent of the modification  2 provide such reasons to the affected franchised mcs provider  and 3 give the affected franchised mcs provider an opportunity to make a presentation before the commissionfranchising authority in order to explain its rationale for such a plan or justify any of the component parts of its comprehensive plan f among the reasons that the commissionfranchising authority may modify or deny the comprehensive plan for extending service are the following 1 the construction schedule is excessive or does not meet the objective or extending service to all residents of the city within a reasonable period of time  2 the cost that is proposed to be borne by a potential subscriber who wishes extension of service is excessive in light of the commissions desire to extend service to all residents  or 3 the proposed comprehensive extension plan extends service in an uneven pattern and in so doing impermissibly discriminates on the basis of race religion color creed sex or handicap g for reasons occasioned by unexpected physical or topographic barriers an affected mcs provider may request at any time modification or relief from its comprehensive plan h the commissionfranchising authority should inspect its comprehensive plan at least once every 12 months to ensure that the affected mcs provider is complying with each integral provision of this section and each integral provision of the mcs providers comprehensive plan  92192   3593 permits and licenses an mcs provider shall obtain at its own expense all permits and licenses required by law rule regulation or ordinance and maintain the same in full force and effect for as long as required  92192 commissionfranchising authoritys policy with respect to safety requirements a the commissionfranchising authority requires that the mcs providers construction operation and maintenance of the multichannel system meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multichannel service b consequently the commissionfranchising authority may require a nonexempt mcs provider to adopt the following safety requirements 1 emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this chapter  2 minimum standby power as noted in this chapter  3 the provision of an indoor signal or safety alert technology in the manner noted in this chapter  4 implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set forth in this chapter  5 follow all fcc rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative leakage index cli limits  and 6 comply with and abide by any construction safety or fire codes as noted in this chapter  92192 provisions to alert subscribers upon emergency  standby power a in order that subscribers may be alerted of an impending imminent or actual natural or manmade emergency then all mcs providers shall ensure that the multichannel system providing multichannel service to all or part of the city is designed so as to permit the chief of police or fire chief or another authorized official of the city to override the audio portion of all channels by touchtone phone or functional equivalent from any location b in addition to any other requirements listed in this section an mcs provider shall 1 designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video  2 inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel at least daily on at least one channel of the multichannel system  3 maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the needs of hearing and sightimpaired customers  4 test the emergency override system not less than once a month  5 cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system  and 6 develop a plan with the citys concurrence in order to provide continuity of multichannel service and response to service calls in the event of a natural or manmade emergency c as one method of providing continuity of multichannel services upon a natural or manmade emergency an mcs provider shall unless exempted by the commissionfranchising authority have the capacity for fourhour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cables and all headends hubs and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable service to and throughout the city  92192 provisions concerning safety alert technology a the commissionfranchising authority considers the need for an indoor signal or safety alert technology available to both subscribers and nonsubscribers of an mcs providers lowest level of programming service of paramount interest and need and as such should be an integral part of an mcs providers system though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency alert override signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it may be used by both subscribers to basic service and nonsubscribers to the basic service of an mcs providers system moreover such safety alert technology is connected to the national weather service 24hour radio service including its new wrsamesite select weather and warning system which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an audio alert voice path regardless of whether an individual has a television receiver or monitor or an fm receiver and moreover can provide effectively instantaneous alert and warning as well as needed instructions in addition to allowing key communityoriented entities to communicate with both the general populace and selected ie target segments of the community b in realization and recognition of the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider shall offer for use throughout the city a signal or safety alert monitoring technology for purposes of alerting both subscribers and nonsubscribers of a multichannel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies and allowing the city to communicate with both subscribers and the public as the need to do so may exist at any time c a nonexempt mcs provider shall cooperate with the city and the provider of such technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary onpremises alert receiving devices including the installation and replacement of such as may be needed from time to time d a nonexempt mcs provider shall install the necessary electronics processing and distribution equipment in the mcs providers headend and will ensure the maintenance operating condition and replacement of such equipment as is necessary to protect its continued use e notwithstanding the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider has no responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining in a timely manner replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components f it is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a multichannel system to use the safety alert device and receive the safety alert service so long as a drop is installed into the address to which such device is attached it is also understood that the user need not have a television receiver in such case the nonsubscriber to basic service may be charged a separate amount for the service either on a monthly basis as a onetime charge or on a monthly installment basis in lieu of a onetime charge g the commissionfranchising authority recognizes the positive effect on the safety of the public in general and the ability to save lives and property of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious warning or alert possible without such a device and technology consequently the commissionfranchising authority requires that all nonexempt mcs providers shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate by the commissionfranchising authority in cooperation with the commissionfranchising authority and the manufacturer to inform the citizenry and noncable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert technology h an mcs provider shall assure that all subscribers to multichannel service receive printed material fully describing the technology and its benefits at least annually and at the time of installation i an mcs provider shall allow nonsubscribers of basic cable service the choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment which shall include the cost of installation on a nondiscriminatory basis and so inform such persons of both options j given the significant public safety and life and property saving benefits of this technology it being the primary and paramount responsibility of government to protect such to the extent possible and the resultant need of as much of the general public as possible to be protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk to life limb and property associated with other alertwarning systems an mcs provider shall assure that the service is provided as part of the same level of service and is priced commensurate with that for any technologyservice deemed comparable by the united states national weather service in the midwestern united states k given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss of life and property and the need and ability of the commissionfranchising authority to communicate directly with the public and specific individual segments of the public individually and discreetly in any number of situations including but not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death and as this technology is clearly not a specific private ie commercial programming service the commissionfranchising authority deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such technology as a governmental use of the system and it is the intent of the city that it be made available to all subscribers in the lowest tier of service provided  92192 implementation of a preventative maintenance program a it shall be the duty of an mcs provider that has more than 1000 subscribers to devise and implement a regular and ongoing preventative maintenance program for the multichannel system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multichannel system that would affect the citizens health safety and welfare or negatively affect the quality of multichannel services being provided b before the mcs provider implements such a program it shall be reviewed by the cable advisory committee and approved by the commissionfranchising authority within 45 days after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program the mcs provider shall prepare and submit a written report to both the cable advisory committee and the commissionfranchising authority detailing the results of the tests conducted and all items performed or addressed during the quarterly program although not exhaustive the following areas should be included in a preventative maintenance program and subsequent report 1 inspection and repair if needed of the headend  2 inspection and repair if needed of the antenna tower  3 requiring weatherproofing and protection of the antenna lead connectors and on any other exposed fittings  4 requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accord with fcc requirements  5 removing tree roots limbs and branches that interfere with or come in contact with the mcs providers cable  6 requiring the periodic servicing testing and calibration of the mcs providers equipment including service vehicles and field test equipment  7 employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or situations in which the multichannel system electronics are operating outside preprogrammed parameters  and 8 testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function properly during an emergency situation  92192 construction fire and safety codes a an mcs provider shall construct operate maintain repair remove replace or restore the multichannel system in strict compliance with all current technical codes adopted by the commissionfranchising authority the state or the united states b the codes referred to specifically include but are not limited to construction fire and safety and zoning codes  92192 alternative user charge a this section is applicable to any licensed but unfranchised mcs provider and to any mcs provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional unenforceable or invalid for all franchised mcs providers then the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable b where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this local law the commissionfranchising authority may impose extract and collect a charge from an affected mcs provider for the use by such provider of the streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city c the alternative user charge shall be based on the following mathematical mode 1 determine the present value of all public streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city in which are located multichannel system facilities and equipment of the affected mcs provider  2 take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the city as determined by the property appraiser for the city for the five preceding years  3 take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  4 add the present value to the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  5 divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  6 multiply that figure by five percent to arrive at the annual user charge that is to be collected from the affected mcs provider for purposes of illustration only the formula reads as follows present value   plus dollar amount of property increase for remaining term of the franchise based on average percentage increase of land appraisals for past years of franchise term divide the adjusted value by the remaining years on the term of the franchise multiply that figure by five percent   equals the annual alternative user charge d the commissionfranchising authority adopts such an alternative user charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected mcs providers use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such mcs providers annual gross revenues however an affected mcs provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues as long as that charge does not exceed five percent of an affected mcs providers annual gross revenues e it is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on the same mcs provider at the same time for the same period f an affected mcs provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds five percent of such providers gross revenues as defined by this chapter for any particular reporting period if the alternative user charge does exceed five percent of gross revenues then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the five percent cap g an affected mcs provider shall pay 25 percent of the alternative user charge at the end of every three months  92192 franchise required  exception a except as provided in subsections b c and d of this section no person or mcs provider shall be permitted to construct operate or maintain a multichannel system which requires the laying or positioning of cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent across the rightsofway of the city without having first obtained a franchise and then entering into a franchise agreement with the city b pursuant to the ccpa a local government may own and operate a multichannel system classified as a cable system consequently should the commissionfranchising authority directly or indirectly legal means available to the commissionfranchising authority decide to purchase acquire construct lease control or otherwise own a cable system within the territorial limits of the city then the commissionfranchising authority shall not be required to submit a proposal for or receive a franchise in order to construct operate and maintain a cable system within the geographical limits of the city c in the case of a person or mcs provider lawfully providing multichannel service on  then such person or mcs provider shall not be required to obtain a franchise and enter into a franchise agreement unless the commissionfranchising authority expressly requires the person or mcs provider to do so d if as a result of annexation a previously unfranchised mcs provider comes under the jurisdiction of the city then such mcs provider shall not be required to obtain a franchise and enter into a franchise agreement unless the commissionfranchising authority expressly requires the operator to do so e where a person or mcs provider is required by the commissionfranchising authority to obtain a franchise then the commissionfranchising authority shall notify the person or mcs provider in writing within 15 working days of the commissionfranchising authoritys formal action f after receipt of notification the affected person or mcs provider has 90 days to submit an application or proposal in substantially the same form and format as required by the commissionfranchising authority the affected person or mcs providers application will be handled as set forth by either state or local law  92192 authority to grant nonexclusive franchises a consistent with section 621a1 of the ccpa codified at 47 usc 541 the commissionfranchising authority may award one or more nonexclusive multichannel service franchises within its geographical limits b a franchised mcs provider shall be selected as part of a public proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the city and the applicant and after which if the applicant is selected as a franchised mcs provider then such applicant will enter into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to the provisions of federal state and local laws and regulations  92192 franchise agreement  minimal requirements a if the commissionfranchising authority awards an applicant a franchise to construct operate or maintain a multichannel system in all or part of the city or approves a proposal for a renewal of a franchise then within 180 days an applicant or a renewal franchised mcs provider and the city shall enter into a franchise agreement which details the rights duties responsibilities and liabilities of both parties b a newly franchised mcs provider may not lay any cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent until the franchise agreement is executed by both the newly franchised mcs provider and the commissionfranchising authority c a franchise agreement shall be in sufficient detail in order to clearly delineate the rights and duties of the franchised mcs provider and the commissionfranchising authority d at a minimum a franchise agreement shall contain provisions for the following 1 a detailed definition of annual gross revenues or gross revenues which specifically includes an explanation of what constitutes the revenue base for determining what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or alternative user charge  2 the term or duration of the franchise  3 indemnity and holds harmless clauses  4 insurance  5 performance and completion bonds or security deposits  6 construction upgrade or rebuild schedule  7 franchise fees  8 continuity of multichannel programming service  9 repeal of prior inconsistent franchise agreements  and 10 a severability clause  92192 extent of grant of franchise a upon an award of a franchise and the subsequent execution of the franchise agreement an mcs provider required to obtain and maintain a franchise may construct erect install maintain operate repair replace remove or restore a multichannel system within the geographical limits set forth in the franchise agreement b the franchised multichannel system may be located in upon along across over and under the streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city c if necessary the responsibility of obtaining easements for private property including privately owned utility or street light poles shall be that of a franchised mcs provider d a franchised mcs provider separate pole or utility easement agreement with an affected utility may locate the multichannel system on or within the property of such utility company this provision specifically includes mcs providers classified as cable operators  92192 term of franchise a the term of an initial renewal franchise may be for a period not to exceed 15 years from the date that a franchise renewal agreement is approved by the commissionfranchising authority b should the highest court of the nation or state invalidate void as unenforceable or unconstitutional the concept of a franchise or franchise duration then the commissionfranchising authority may adopt emergency rules and regulations in order to preserve and protect the rights and duties of both the commissionfranchising authority and any franchised mcs provider during the interim the invalid franchise may be considered unless prohibited by the state and interpreted in the same manner and fashion as a business license upon the adoption of emergency rules the commissionfranchising authority should enter into a new agreement which describes under which terms and conditions of the franchised mcs providers system may be reviewed and examined and under what circumstances may a franchised mcs provider forfeit its right to operate a multichannel system within all or part of the city  92192 application for franchise

side of the road shall be based upon posted speed limits along the parcel frontage the minimum spacing indicated below are measured from centerline to centerline driveway spacing standards posted speed limit mph minimum driveway spacing in feet 30 155 35 185 40 225 45+ 300 2 insufficient street frontage for sites with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion the planning commission may require construction of the driveway along a side street a shared driveway with an adjacent property construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the intersection or require a servicefrontage road 3 offsets to reduce leftturn conflicts new commercial driveways should be aligned with driveways or streets on the opposite side of the roadway where possible if alignment is not possible driveways should be offset a minimum of two hundred fifty 250 feet along an arterial roadway and one hundred fifty 150 feet along other roadways longer offsets may be

driveway with an adjacent property construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the intersection or require a servicefrontage road f standards for shared driveways and servicefrontage roads the use of service roads in conjunction with driveway spacing is intended to preserve traffic flow along major thoroughfares and minimize traffic conflicts while retaining reasonable access to the property where noted above or where the planning commission determines that reducing the number of access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic operations and safety while preserving the property owners right to reasonable access access from a side street a shared driveway or service road connecting two or more properties or uses may be required in particular

owners as part of a request for rezoning this is especially true since the city must consider all potential uses which may be made of property when considering a traditional rezoning request some of which may be inappropriate for a particular piece of property considering items such as but not limited to the surrounding land uses the city master plan available infrastructure and utilities and natural features it is the intent of this section to provide a process consistent with the provisions of section 405 of the michigan zoning enabling act public act no 110 of 2006 as amended mcl  et

that all four of the following requirements are met a that the property could not be reasonably used for the purposes permitted in that zone  b that the appeal results from unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not from general neighborhood conditions  c that the use requested by the variance would not alter the essential character of the area  and d that the alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property 2 nonuse variances the applicant must present evidence to show that if the zoning ordinance is applied strictly practical difficulty will result to the applicant and a that the ordinance restrictions unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose  b that the variance would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district and a lesser relaxation than that requested would not give substantial relief to the owner of the property or be more consistent with justice to other property owners  c that the plight of the landowner is due to the unique circumstances of the property  and d that the alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property  decision the board of zoning appeals shall adopt a decision on all matters properly brought before it within 90 days from the date of the filing of
