acceptable temporary detention 14201 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to set requirements for the control of storm water drainage in connection with the construction of impervious surface area such as hard surface parking driveways building roofs etc it must be recognized that the flow of surface water is greatly increased with the construction of impervious surface area as compared to the original vegetation ground cover it must also be recognized that underground storm sewer drainage is normally designed at a capacity level of two inches per hour when rainfall events exceed storm sewer capacity swales or other surface grade provisions must be made around buildings to accommodate excess runoff this is imperative for lots that are located in a natural water course 14202 three levels of surface drainage requirements there are three levels of surface drainage requirements listed hereafter the applicable level is based upon the square feet of impervious surface on a contiguous site not separated by public rightofway the impervious surface area is the square footage of the proposed improvement or combination of existing and proposed impervious surface area on the site credit will be allowed if an existing impervious surface area is replaced with another surface within one year the replaced square footage will be deducted from the total square footage of the new impervious area 1 level 1 0  7000 square feet of impervious surface area storm water runoff to be reduced by using reasonably acceptable measures 2 level 2 7001  30000 square feet impervious surface area allowable runoff from the site shall be equal to that of a rainfall intensity of two inches per hour for residential development when the calculated allowable runoff is exceeded storm water detention must be designed with a minimum capacity of 50% of the difference between the allowable runoff and a 100year rainfall event also the site plan must clearly describe where storm water that is not detained will flow off the site a partial or full variance may be granted with conditions by the city only if detention is determined to be unnecessary or impractical 3 level 3 above 30000 square feet impervious surface area allowable runoff from the site shall be equal to that of a rainfall intensity of two inches per hour for residential development when the calculated allowable runoff is exceeded storm water detention must be designed with a minimum capacity of 100% of the difference between the allowable runoff and a 100year rainfall event also the site plan must clearly describe where storm water that is not detained will flow off the site a partial or full variance may be granted with conditions by the city only if detention is determined to be unnecessary or impractical calculations must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state of iowa and familiar with storm water detention calculations chapter 142 control of storm water drainage code of ordinances sioux center iowa  710  14203 acceptable temporary detention acceptable temporary detention may include but is not limited to on or offsite detention on or offsite absorption areas joint detention for multiple properties and provisions made for entire subdivisions 14204 when a detention variance is granted when a partial or full detention variance is granted a fee shall be applied to compensate the city for its costs of making drainage improvements related to the additional surface runoff the fee calculation shall be six dollars $600 per cubic foot of storm water detention excused by the variance the fee shall be paid upon completion of construction 14205 building construction when building construction takes place on property located in or near a natural surface water drainage area or swale provisions must be made for excess surface water flows any building placed in such an area must be constructed with adjoining grade at least 6 above the elevation of any downstream surface constraint in addition adequate swale provisions must be constructed on the property to allow excess runoff water to flow around the building without blocking or unreasonably restricting surface flows in the natural drainage area the next page is 725 code of ordinances sioux center iowa  725  chapter 145 dangerous buildings 14501 enforcement officer 14505 conduct of
