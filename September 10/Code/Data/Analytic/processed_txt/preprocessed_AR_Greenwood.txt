commercial development guidelines general  site planning  parking and circulation  landscaping  walls and fences  screening  architectural design guidelines  roofs  windows  awnings  signs  lighting  general the following design guidelines are intended to provide a reference framework to assist an applicant in understanding the citys goals and objectives for high quality development within the commercial land use districts the guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in the zoning ordinance by providing good examples of appropriate design solutions and by providing design interpretations of the various mandatory regulations these guidelines are intended to result in the enhancement of greenwoods character and image as well as further the establishment of sense of place by the following a specifying the use of high quality building materials b identification and consistent use of design elements which contribute to quality and good design in site planning architecture landscaping signage and other site amenities c creating a consistent cohesive character within a development that is also compatible to its surroundings d encouraging both vehicular and pedestrian circulation 199 s14 the design guidelines are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects the guidelines will be utilized during the citys design review process to encourage the highest level of design quality while at the same time providing the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity on the part of project designers applicability the provision of this section shall apply to all commercial development within the city any addition remodeling renovating relocation or construction requiring a building permit within any commercial land use district and where any conditional use permit site plan review or rezoning is required shall adhere to these guidelines where applicable noncompliance to these guidelines may be grounds for denial of a project where an existing building is purchased or is to be remodeled or renovated and where the property does not meet the landscaping criteria of these guidelines 50% of the perimeter parking area must conform to theses landscaping guidelines as a part of the project general design principles a desirable elements of project design the qualities and design elements for commercial structures that are most desirable include 1 richness of surface and texture 2 significant wall articulation insets canopies wing walls trellises 3 multiplaned pitched roofs 4 roof overhangs arcades 5 regular or traditional window rhythm 6 articulated mass and bulk 7 significant landscape and hardscape elements 8 prominent access driveways 9 landscaped and screened parking 10 comprehensive sign program 11 safe integration of vehicular bicycle and pedestrian traffic b undesirable elements the elements to avoid or minimize include 1 large blank unarticulated stucco wall surfaces 2 unpainted concrete precision block walls 3 highly reflective surfaces 4 metal siding on the main faade 5 plastic siding 6 square boxlike structures 7 mix of unrelated styles ie rustic wood shingles and polished chrome 8 large outofscale signs with flashy colors 9 visible outdoor storage loading and equipment areas 10 disjointed parking areas and confusing circulation patterns  200 s18  site planning placement of structure should consider the existing built context of the commercial are the location of incompatible lands uses the location of major traffic generators vehicular and pedestrian access circulation and parking preservation and buffering of views as well as an analysis of a sites characteristics and particular influences a handicap access handicap access is required per the international international building the american disabilities act guidelines the caboansi standards for handicap accessibility shall be followed b fire departmentemergency access site planning must provide for the fire departmentemergency access and comply with all adopted local and state fire prevention when parking control is necessary along required access such access shall be labeled on plans as fire lane and fire lane signs stating no parking must be installed at the time of development under commercial guidelines no fire hydrants shall be located greater than every three hundred 300 feet so as to adequately protect each structure in development  c compatibility structures should be sited in a manner that will complement the adjacent structure sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to provide order and diversity and avoid a jumbled confused development d clustering whenever possible new structures should be clustered this creates plazas or pedestrian malls and prevents long barrackslike rows of structures linear strip development is discouraged this type of development is characterized by uses that are only one store deep and buildings are arranged in a linear fashion rather than clustered this type of design also does not promote interaction between people and places if this approach is used the development must incorporate variation in building height building mass roof forms and changes in wall planes in the architectural design to mitigate the linear effect e pedestrian considerations the quality of the pedestrian environment should be considered as a central defining aspect of the site layout and design theme for all types of commercial centers 1 pedestrian circulation must be provided from the perimeter of the site to all buildings 201 s14 2 primary pedestrian or bicycle connections must be not less than 8 feet in width secondary interior sidewalks must be no less than 5 feet in width 3 parking stall overhang into any sidewalk or landscape area will require an increase in the minimum sidewalk or landscape area by the depth of the overhand 2 foot for each overhang 4 sidewalk areas in front of buildings shall be designated to accommodate pedestrian activity sidewalks in front of or directly adjacent to singular freestanding buildings less than 20000 square feet should not be less than 7 feet in width exclusive of auto overhand sidewalks in front of buildings in excess of 20000 square feet should be no less than 10 feet in width 5 locate structures and onsite circulation systems to minimize pedestrianvehicle conflicts where possible link structures to the public sidewalk where possible with textured paving landscaping and trellises f traffic calming the use of traffic calming techniques is encouraged with commercial developments these design features are intended to slow traffic and divert any cut so as to provide a safer and more attractive environment for people such techniques should be considered as part of comprehensive integrated transportation and site layout strategy 1 traffic calming techniques include such features as wide speedbumps raised crosswalks raised intersections traffic circles and roundabouts landscaped medians and diverters and travel land narrow points also known as traffic chokers and curb bulbouts 2 narrow speed bumps are the least desirable type of traffic calming device and should be avoided since speed bumps can cause loss of control of the vehicle at higher speeds g sense of entry a sense of entry or arrival must be created at primary entryways into the development building placement landscaping gates entry monuments specialty lighting and other design elements can be used to create this design effect the architectural details of primary entries should be integrated with the overall design of the development in terms of materials scale proportion and design elements 202 s14 h orientation of structures freestanding singular commercial structures should be oriented with their major entry toward the street where access is provided as well as having their major faade parallel to the street i setbacks building and parking lot setbacks are measured from property lines after dedication of all required future rightofway building setbacks are based on a maximum building height of 25 feet buildings in excess of 25 feet may require additional setback 1 landscaping is required in parking lot setback areas 2 parking setbacks apply to all parking access drives loading and trash areas 3 where any of these setbacks conflict the more stringent will generally apply setback setback arterial and collector streets bldg  35 feet  parking 10 feet  or bldg 40 feet  with 100% landscaping between property line and building no parking or pavement in this area local streets bldg 30 feet  parking 10 feet  interior property within the commercial development bldg 20 feet  parking 10 feet  other property line adjacent to nonresidential property bldg 20 feet  parking 10 feet  other property line adjacent to residential property or public property bldg 50 feet  parking 25 feet  these setbacks may vary depending on the overall site plan setbacks are measured from property lines j phased development construction phasing must be indicated on the development plan the timing of construction of pad sites of individual lots may be subject to further restrictions 203 s14 k gradingslope 1 pavement grades should not exceed 5% 5% agrees with sidewalk ordinance longitudinal slope within a parking area and 8% longitudinal slope in drive aisles that do not have parking stalls along the aisles 2 site entryexit aisles shall not exceed 12% longitudinal slope from the public street to 50 feet into the site the 50 feet shall be measured from the property line standard specifications for design and construction of public improvements 3 sidewalk cross slopes shall not exceed 2% 2% agrees with sidewalk ordinance sidewalk longitudinal slopes shall comply with the american disability association requirements l utility lines existing and new utility lines and services be placed underground both within and adjacent to the development including adjacent rightofway m open space 1 development of a project greater than 5 acres must include a publicly accessible outdoor space such as a pedestrian plaza park pavilion or courtyard a water feature fountain sculpture or other feature may be considered in lieu of a larger outdoor space amenities such as specialty paving specialty lighting and street furniture are required throughout the development 2 recognize the importance of spaces between structures as outdoor rooms on the site outdoor spaces should have clear recognizable shapes that reflect careful planning and are not simply left over area between structures such spaces should provide pedestrian amenities such as shade benches fountains etc 3 public open space should be located in proximity to areas of activity such as primary circulation routes and building entrances building entrances major site connectors and other focal points are preferred for locating useable open space such as plazas courtyards and landscaped seating areas 4 open space area should be clustered into larger predominant landscape areas rather than equally distributing them into areas of low impact such as 204 s14 at building peripheries behind a structure or areas of little impact to the public view where they are not required as a land use buffer or as a required yard setback n bikeway facilities bikeway facilities including wide travel lanes striped bicycle lanes offroad pathways and bicycle parking facilities should be considered within commercial developments where appropriate to the scale of the development where vehicular traffic moves slower it can be expected that bicycles can safely mix with the flow of automobiles in the traffic lane in larger commercial developments and where heavier bicycle traffic is expected it may appropriate to consider various options including wider drive aisles designated bicycle lanes andor a system of separate pathways for bicycles o loading facilities loading facilities should not be located at the front of structures where it is difficult to adequately screen them from view such facilities are more appropriate at the rear of the site where special screening may not be required   parking and circulation parking lot design can be a critical factor in the success or failure of a commercial use in considering the possibilities for developing a new parking area a developer should analyze the following factors ingress and egress with consideration to possible conflicts with street traffic  pedestrian and vehicular conflicts  onsite circulation and service vehicle zones  and the overall configuration and appearance of the parking area a drivethroughs drivefor restaurants banks pharmacies and other uses should be integrated with the overall site layout so as to provide safe efficient integrated vehicular and pedestrian circulation adequate vehicular stacking or queuing space should be provided to avoid waiting vehicles from blocking drive aisles b separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems are encouraged pedestrian linkages between uses in commercial developments should be emphasized including distinct pedestrian access from parking areas in large commercial developments such as shopping centers c parking circulation design considerations 1 parking aisles should be separated from vehicle circulation routes whenever possible 2 parking areas shall be landscaped receiving interior as well as perimeter treatment in accordance with the landscaping section of these guidelines 3 parking areas should be separated from structures by either a raised concrete walkway or landscaped strip preferably both situations where parking spaces directly abut the structures should be avoided 4 common driveways which provide vehicular access to more than one site are encouraged 5 shared parking between adjacent businesses andor developments is highly encourage whenever practical 6 where parking areas are connected interior circulation should allow for a similar direction of travel and parking bays in all areas to reduce conflict at points of connection 7 whenever possible locate site entries on side streets in order to minimize pedestrianvehicular conflicts when this is not possible design the front site entry with appropriately patterned concrete or pavers to differentiate it from the sidewalks 8 design parking areas so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars minimize the need for the pedestrian to cross parking aisles and landscape areas 9 parking areas and pedestrian walkways should be visible from structures to the greatest degree possible 10 the parking area should be designed in a manner which links the structures to the street sidewalk system as an extension of the pedestrian environment this can be accomplished by using design features such as walkways with enhanced paving trellis structures or a special landscaping treatment 11 parking area which accommodates a significant number of vehicles should be divided into a series of connected smaller lots landscaping and offsetting portions of the lot are effective in reducing the visual impact of large parking areas 205 s14 206 s14 d dropoff areas areas to safely drop off and pick up passengers and to load goods into vehicles are an important features for many commercial uses such as grocery stores drugstores movie theaters and home improvement centers dropoff zones should be integrated into the design of the commercial centers with attractive paving adequate separation of vehicles and pedestrians and convenient location near building entrances using attractive paving material for the dropoff zone such as paving blocks or colored concrete can help to define the dropoff zone the vehicle stopping area for the dropoff zone should not block traffic in the drive aisle e access to parking areas parking access points whether located on front or side streets should be located as far as possible from street intersections so that adequate stacking room is provided the number of access points should be limited to the minimum amount necessary to provide adequate circulation f bicycle facilities the provision of adequate safe and convenient bicycle parking facilities is an important component of a comprehensive program to encourage the use of bicycles as a viable transportation option 1 the location should be close to building entrances easily identifiable visible to those passing by and separate from pedestrian circulation areas 2 longterm bicycle parking facilities are attractive for employment centers schools transit nodes and other such uses where people will leave the bicycle for all or part of a day longterm bicycle parking should provide a high degree of security and safety use of bicycle lockers designated areas within buildings or outside areas with constant visual monitoring 3 shortterm bicycle parking should be located in highly visible locations near the building entrance with inverted u shaped loop racks or similar design instead of ribbon or wavetype racks which are less effective for locking the bicycle g the first parking stall which is perpendicular to a driveway or first aisle juncture should be at least 30 feet back from the curb with larger centers significantly more setback area may be required h utilize a 36 inch high opaque wall or landscaping to screen any parking at the street periphery a combination of walls berms and landscape material is highly recommended where practical lowering the grade of the parking lot from 207 s14 existing street elevations may aid in obscuring views of automobiles while promoting views of architectural elements of the structures beyond   landscaping the city of greenwood recognizes that landscaping is an important component of quality development and that enhancing the appearance of the city with landscaping increases the desirability of living and working in greenwood landscaping serves multiple purposes both aesthetic and functional landscaping in commercial development is intended but not limited to making the environment physically more comfortable to the user buffering or enhancing views reducing noise creating seasonal interest assisting in water quality efforts and storm management enhancing the public street appearance and enhancing the commercial development a landscaping considerations 1 landscaping for commercial uses should be used to define specific areas by helping to focus on entrances to buildings and parking lots provide shade define the edges of various land uses provide transition between neighboring properties buffering define onsite circulation break up expanses of paving or wall and provide screening for loading and equipment areas 2 landscaping should be in scale with adjacent structures and be of appropriate size at maturity to accomplish its intended purpose 3 landscaping around the entire base of structures is recommended to soften the edge between the parking lot and the structure this should be accented at entrances to provide focus 4 landscaping should be protected from vehicular and pedestrian encroachment by raised planting surfaces depressed walks or the use of curbs 5 use boxed and tubbed plants in clay or wood containers especially for enhancement of sidewalk slopes piazas and courtyards b trees 1 trees should be located throughout the parking lot and not simply at the ends of parking aisles 2 in general formal standalone trees are encouraged along major streets and in medians with less formal clustered tree type design at the intersections and entrances 3 at maturity trees should be able to be trimmed 10 feet above ground and shrubs should be maintained at a height of approximately 3 feet to provide adequate visibility 208 s14 c detention ponds 1 where detention is required detention ponds should be contained within a lot or parcel that includes a building site one detention area may be required to serve several lots versus individual detention ponds for each lot 2 detention ponds should be landscaped with native grasses these ponds must be maintained by the owner or business association trickle channels should be designed to look natural such as using cobble or boulders with an underdrain d reclaimed water the use of reclaimed water for landscape areas is encouraged when available e responsibility of maintenance the developers or property owner is responsible for the installation and maintenance of landscaping in the rightofway of all streets   walls and fences a if not required for a specific screening or security purpose walls should not be utilized within commercial areas the intent is to keep the walls as low as possible while performing their screening and security functions b where walls are used at property frontages or screen walls are used to conceal storage and equipment areas they should be designed to blend with the sites architecture both sides of all perimeter walls or fences should be architecturally treated landscaping should be used in combination with such walls whenever possible chain link fencing is not allowed within commercial areas c when security fencing is required it should be a combination of solid walls with pillars and decorative view ports or short solid wall segments and wrought iron grill work 209 s14 d long expanses of fence or wall surfaces should be offset and architecturally designed to prevent monotony landscape pockets should be provided   screening a screening for outdoor storage should be a minimum of 6 feet and a maximum of 10 feet high the height should be determined by the height of the material of equipment being screened vinyl or wood fencing is an acceptable screening material for areas of any lot not visible from the street exterior storage should be confined to portions of the site least visible to public view b where screening is required and will be visible from the public rightofway a combination of elements should be used including solid masonry walls berms and landscaping c all mechanical equipment such as compressors airconditioners antennas pumps heating and ventilating equipment emergency generators chiller elevator penthouses water tanks stand pipes solar collectors satellite dishes and communications equipment and any other type of mechanical equipment for the building must be indicated on the architectural drawings 1 all rooftop mechanical equipment must be screened on all sides to full height by building parapet walls or other building elements that appear as integral elements of the overall building design unless approved otherwise by the city 2 mechanical equipment should not be located on the roof of a structure unless the equipment can be screened d mechanical equipment should be clustered as much as possible and appropriately screened from view the method of screening shall be architecturally integrated with the adjacent structure in terms of materials color shape and size where individual equipment is provided a continuous screen is desirable e all screening must be properly maintained by the developer or property owner   architectural design guidelines the architectural design of commercial buildings must consider and accommodate the overall desire of the city of greenwood to create and enhance community image greenwoods identity and livability will be strengthened 210 s14 design and development the identification and application of architectural design requirements will assist greenwood in achieving a strong community image a height and mass 1 heights of structures should relate to adjacent open spaces to allow maximum sun and ventilation protection from prevailing winds enhance public views of surrounding mountains and minimize obstruction of view from adjoining structures 2 height and scale of new development should be compatible with that of surrounding development new development height should transition from the height of adjacent development to the maximum height of the proposed structure 3 multiple buildings in single projects should be varied in size and mass a transition from low buildings at the site perimeter to larger and taller structures on the interior of the site is generally encouraged b 360 degree architecture is generally required all sides of buildings are to be treated with the same architectural style use of materials and details as the front elevation of the building as determined by the city where it can be demonstrated with certainty that a particular side of the building will not be visible from public view in the future the planning commission may consider a variance from this requirement c large buildings which give the appearance of boxlike structures are generally unattractive and detract from the overall scale of most buildings there are several ways to reduce the appearance of large scale bulky structures 1 vary the planes of the exterior walls in depth andor direction wall lanes should not run in one continuous direction for more than 50 feet without an offset 2 vary the height of the buildings so that it appears to be divided into distinct massing elements 3 articulate the different parts of a buildings faade by use of color arrangement of faade elements or a change in materials 4 use landscaping and architectural detailing at the ground level to lessen the impact of an otherwise bulky building 211 s14 5 avoid blank walls at the ground floor levels utilize windows trellises wall articulation arcades change in materials or other features d scale scale for purposes here in the relationship between the size of the new structure and the size of adjoining permanent structures it is also how the proposed buildings size relates to the size of a human being human scale large scale building elements will appear imposing if they are situated in a visual environment which is predominantly smaller in scale 1 building scale can be reduced proper use of window patterns structural bays roof overhangs siding awnings moldings fixtures and other details 2 the scale of buildings should be carefully related to adjacent pedestrian areas ie plazas courtyards and other structures 3 large dominating structures should be broken up by a creating horizontal emphasis use of trim  b adding awnings eaves windows or other architectural ornamentation  c use of combinations of complementary colors  and d landscape materials e franchise architecture building elements must not function as signage the appearance of franchise architecture where the building functions as signage is discouraged exact duplicate prototypes are generally not acceptable as a solution for the design of commercial developments it is understood that the chains want to present a consistent corporate identity  however the proliferation of exact replicas throughout the city creates an anonymous bland characterless environment the building footprint building massing and general design scheme may be repeated to some degree but incorporation of franchise or business design elements unique or symbolic of particular business must be secondary to the overall architectural design of the commercial development f building materials 1 the use of brick as a primary material is required unless determined otherwise by the city quality finish materials that can be used in conjunction with brick include stone integrally tinted textured masonry block  precast concrete tiltconcrete panels with brick or stone facing 212 stucco and external insulation finish system that simulates a stucco appearance 2 wood siding may be considered for use in limited applications and not as a primary building material 3 smoothfaced concrete block tiltup concrete panels or metal siding is prohibited as a predominant exterior building material 4 precast concrete must have integral color contain other materials embedded within and be articulated with design detailing or have application of other building materials to create detailed design interest 5 the city will consider a variance from the requirement to use brick as the primary building material only when the design and use of an alternate acceptable building material is incorporated into a set of overall design guidelines that are determined by the city to be exemplary of outstanding design and desirable by the city g architectural focal points architectural focal points provide visual interest and can help define a sense of place the use of building or design elements such as towers articulated rooflines artwork fountains pedestrian seating areas or landscape plantings as special focal points is encouraged signage on towers or other highly visible architectural features should be discouraged h color 1 the color and intensity of color of all building materials is subject to city approval in general subdued colors typical of the muted native grasses wood rocks and soil of greenwoods natural setting are to be used as the primary colors 2 large areas of intense white color should be avoided while subdued colors usually work best as a dominant overall color a bright trim color can be appropriate 3 the color palette chosen for new structures should be compatible with the colors of adjacent structures an exception is where the colors of adjacent structures strongly diverge from these design guidelines 4 wherever possible minimize the number of colors appearing on the structures exterior small commercial structures should use no more than three colors 213 s14 5 primary colors should only be used to accent elements such as door and window frames and architectural details 6 architectural detailing should be painted to complement the faade and tie in with adjacent structures i building top buildings should have a defined top this can be accomplished with cornices caps parapets or roofs 1 tops take advantage of the visual prominence of a buildings silhouette and should be approximately onetwentieth of a buildings height or 12 inches whichever is more 2 techniques for clearly expressing a top include but are not limited to cornice treatment roof overhangs stepped parapets textured materials and differently colored materials colored stripes are not acceptable as the only treatment j building mounted equipment the location of building mounted equipment mechanical electrical gutters downspouts etc must result in these elements being hidden or screened so they are unobtrusive all building mounted elements must be painted to match the color of the surrounding building material unless approved otherwise by the city k accessory buildings accessory buildings or structures which are not compatible and consistent with the material and design of the main building are not allowed l trash enclosures 1 trash enclosures should be clustered and where site planning permits made to appear as an extension of the building trash areas within the building itself are encouraged 2 dumpsters and trash cannot be visible above the height of surrounding enclosure unroofed enclosure walls shall be a minimum of 8 feet trash enclosures visible over 8 feet from residential areas or public streets should be roofed 3 outdoor trash compactors are generally prohibited due to concerns of noise smell fire and access 214 s14 m vending machines soda water and other vending machines of a similar size should be placed within a building smaller vending machines such as newspaper machines are exempt from these criteria   roofs a threedimensional rooftops 1 variation in rooflines is suggested to reduce the scale of large building 2 parapets must conceal flat roofs 3 pedestrian entries into buildings should be further emphasized 4 overhanging eaves sloped roofs and three or more roof planes may be required 5 the roofline at the top of the structure should not run in continuous plane for more than 50 feet without offsetting or jogging the roof plane b rooftop equipment rooftop equipment shall be screened from public view by screening materials of the same nature as the structures basic materials mechanical equipment should be located below the highest vertical element of the building c roofing materials the following roof materials should not be used 1 corrugated metal standing rib metal roofs are permitted 2 highly reflective surfaces copper roofs may be considered 3 illuminated roofing metal roofs shall have a low gloss finish to reduce glare   windows a the use of windows is required in areas where there is significant pedestrian activity or to assist in breaking up the appearance of blank walls as determined by the city b windows should be for display purposes or allow viewing both into and out of the interior of the building c windows may be required to be recessed into the building wall to create shadow 215 s14 d windows windows with awnings and covered pedestrian walkways should total at least 60% of the building frontage along public streets or parking lots an exception to this requirement may be considered for individual tenants in excess of 20000 square feet gross floor area or the rear elevation of a building that backs up to a public street e reflective glass or mirrored glass is prohibited unless determined otherwise by the city clear glass shall be used for storefronts windows and doors window painting or view blocking techniques are generally not permitted   awnings a the use of awnings along a row of contiguous structures should be restricted to awnings of the same form and location color of the awnings should be consistent and a minimum 7 foot vertical clearance should be maintained b signs on awnings should be painted or stenciled and be limited to the awnings flap valance or to the end panels of angled curved or box awnings c plexiglas metal and glossy vinyl illuminated awnings are strongly discouraged canvas treated canvas matte finish vinyl and fabric awnings are encouraged d the practice of suspending a small sign from an awning to guide pedestrian traffic to a business it encouraged the sign should have a minimum clearance of 7 feet from ground level   signs a every structure and commercial complex should be designed with a precise concept for adequate signing provisions for sign placement sign scale in relationship with the building and sign readability should be considered in developing the signing concept all signing should be highly compatible with the building and site design relative to color materials and placement b all signage is not necessarily intended to be viewed from a public street  however if signs are visible from a public street they must not compromise public safety by attracting undue attention as determined by the city c monumenttype signs are the preferred alternative for business identification whenever possible where several tenants occupy the same site individual wallmounted signs are appropriate in combination with a monument sign identifying the development and address 216 s14 d the use of backlit individually cut letter signs is strongly encouraged e each development site should be appropriately signed to give directions to loading and receiving areas visitor parking and other special areas   lighting a lighting should be used to provide illumination for the security and safety of onsite areas such as parking loading shipping and receiving pathways and working areas b the design of light fixtures and their structural support should be architecturally compatible with the main structures onsite illuminators should be integrated within the architectural design of the structures c parking lot lights should not exceed 30 feet in height d illumination levels should be designed to average 1 foot candle in parking lots and other similar areas measured 45 feet above the ground surface parking lot lighting should be with metal halide or other type of white lighting e as a security device lighting should be adequate but not overly bright and high contrast between properties should be avoided all building entrances should be welllighted f lighting should be designed to minimize excessive lighting of the night sky g all lighting fixtures must be shielded to confine light spread within the site boundaries offsite glare onto adjacent properties or rightofway is not permitted h the location of freestanding thematic lighting should occur in the pedestrian area between buildings and parking areas and along primary access drives  217 city of greenwood ar dept of planning and development greenwood arkansas zoning ordinance & district regulations ordinance
