council has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation the council does not intend this suppress and speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses b legislative findings based upon a public meeting conducted by the borough the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented material on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration 2 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of the reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretoforenonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the borough it is appropriate to require reasonable

the adverse secondary effects of such businesses 6 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable disease to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 7 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 9 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the borough will be promoted by the enactment of this limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to  pm monday closure of such businesses on sundays and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes

sugarcreek b statement of findings the council of the borough of sugarcreek finds that 1 inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increase the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources 2 a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff  is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough of sugarcreek and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 3 inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydro logic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollution concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge 4 stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 5 public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues 6 federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes c purpose the purpose of this to promote health safety and

addressing methodology frontage interval addressing system the frontage interval addressing system is based on the measurement of the intervals between and beginning of a road and structures along the road the frontage interval system will follow an interval guideline or measurement increments which will yield approximately 400 possible address numbers per mile 10 of 17 appendix a street naming and addressing policy the frontage interval system includes rules for the point of beginning of the road the location of odd and even numbers along a road the takeoff point for semicircular roads and numbering culdesacs numbering of diagonal roads numbering of apartments and duplexes numbering of businesses trailer parks and stacked addresses the following list is a description of the generally acceptable numbering standards 1 the frontage interval assign numbers every 264 feet or approximately each 1100 mile this will yield approximately 400 numbers per mile 200 odd on one side and 200 even on the other side 2 oddeven number location assign even numbers on the right side from the point of beginning and odd numbers on the left side from the point of beginning 3 beginning point numbering should begin at the west beginning point and proceed eastward or at the south beginning point and proceed northward in the case of a deadend road the beginning point will be at the point of departure from the main road regardless of direction see b 8 4 fractional alphanumeric hyphenated addresses there should be no use of fractional addresses alphanumeric address numbers nor hyphenated address number eg 34  ash street 123 a main st 41656 bell st rules one shall apply unless you are continuing a city numbering scheme as in leaving a city or subdivision where other numbers are used in this case the existing system in place will dictate the beginning oddeven number see b 10 four b 14 5 diagonal streets diagonal streets should be treated as either northsouth or eastwest streets arbitrary decisions on the direction are acceptable but the primary direction should be chosen 6 circular streets circular streets and roads begin at the low numbered intersection and are numbered with the even numbers on the inside of the circle the outside of the circle is numbered first and consecutively the inside is then numbered to match and mix with the outside this will result in some cases fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and also with spaces between the numbers 7 culdesacs culdesacs often require applying the rules for both deadend streets and circular streets those without buildings in the center portion should be numbered as if the center line of the street bisects the culdesac the numbering begins from the intersection of the main road and ascends toward the culdesac once in the culdesac the numbers proceed odd around the left side of the circle and even around the right side of the circle progressing in the direction that the numbers increase odd and even numbers meet at midpoint or the back of the culdesac 11 of 17 appendix a street naming and addressing policy on rare occasions there may be structures inside the culdesac when this occurs number the structure or structures in the way that will fit best generally there are no houses in the middle ground 8 corner assigning numbers to corner lots use the front door when the front door is obscured or if the structure is best reached for emergency purposes by the driveway assign the property number based on where the driveway falls on the road 9 crossing county lines when crossing county lines consideration will be given to an existing numbering system in that county if no system exists the numbering will stop at the county line if a system does exist in that county those numbers may continue following the rules for distance and direction 10 stacked addresses houses or trailers behind other houses or trailers facing the road sharing a common driveway should be numbered following the rules for distance and direction herein use of a hyphenated alphanumeric or fractional number is discouraged 11 apartments and duplexes apartments and other multitenant structures should be numbered with the main building and then assigned apartment numbers as secondary location indicators eg 202 main st apt 303 if possible use apartment numbers to indicate the floor location eg apt 303 is the third apartment on the third floor 12 businesses businesses and business districts should be numbered just as apartments with the middle of the building determining the number and the offices or businesses in the building being numbered as suites eg 225 oak dr suite 34 this rule may also be applied to office parks where each business has its own small building 13 interfacing with existing systems when interfacing with existing numbering systems care should be taken in locating the last assigned number of the existing system all possible sources should be checked to determine the last number 14 mobile home parks mobile home parks should be numbered just like apartments unless already marked the difference would be that individual mobile homes will be designated as lots instead of apartments eg 334 elm st lot 23 an alternative is to name the roads in the park and number the homes as single family dwellings following the rules for distance and direction herein eg 45 forest ln 15 highways highways with no numbering system in place or where the system is to change shall be numbered from county line to county line following the rules for distance and direction herein 12 of 17 appendix a street naming and addressing policy 16 structures when assigning numbers the middle of the structure should determine the address assigned structures should always be numbered according to the road they face not where the driveway enters the road or where the mailbox is an exception to this is when the structure is obscured or if the structure is best reached for emeregency purposes by the driveway in such cases the address should be assigned where the driveway falls on the road 17 preplanning subdivisions new subdivisions will require street naming and address assignments to the
