environmental constraints subdivision may be reduced by the environmental constraints cluster adjustment set forth in below 2 the minimum residential site is the minimum residential site size permitted and such residential site size shall be determined by applying the following net residential site adjustment factors to each individual residential site sought to be created  1855 fee schedule  1856 a373 cluster residential site adjustment factors constraint cluster adjustment factor per acre resultant minimum lot size slopes  25% or more 20 5 acres slopes  15% to 24% deep soils

shall be required to have a minimum area as is determined by the constraints applicable to each residential site sought to be created in determining minimum allowable residential site size each of the constraints to which residential sites shall be subject shall be determined in the same manner utilizing the same plant information as set forth above the size of any individual residential site may be reduced below five acres by applying the density factor in accordance with the area in acres of the residential site subject to the constraints set forth the numbers of acres subject to each particular constraint are multiplied by a corresponding cluster adjustment factor the products of each of these multiplications are totaled and the resultant net lot area must be equal to or greater than one example assuming a three acre net residential site is subject to the following constraints one acre has slopes of 25% or more and two acres have shallow depth to bedrock applying the above formula the calculations would be as follows 1 acre x 02 unitsunit per acre   02 units 2 acre x 033 units acre   066 units  1856 sparta code  1856 a374  1857 energy standards a 508 total   086 units the total of the above calculations is 086 since the resultant figure as set forth in the formula must be equal to or greater than 10 the example three acre residential site is of insufficient size this residential site would have to be enlarged so that the resultant calculations with the appropriate constraints applied thereto would result in 10 or greater in cases where portions of residential sites are subject to two different types overlapped of constraint categories the more stringent density factor shall be applied 4 the planning board may in its discretion require the submission of a sitespecific plot plan for any such residential site depicting the proposed location thereon of the dwelling house or other principal structure the septic system and driveway access thereto the

board in some cases development should be avoided and in other cases very low density development is recommended additional improvements and safeguards to protect significant environmental features and elements shall be required i flood plain lands lands which lie adjacent to streams and are periodically inundated and flooded by rains as the streams and watercourses overflow these areas generally should not be developed with buildings the ban on development in this area is to protect the lives and property of those living in the flood plain from flooding prevent flooding downstream which results when flood plain areas are developed and prevent pollution of streams and rivers because of inadequate percolation  1865 fee schedule  1865 a385 ii areas of excessive slope these are lands with slopes in excess of 25% depending on the nature of the soil bearing capacity erosion factor and degree of slope development densities may vary from no building to very low densities with appropriate safeguards in general as slope increases the density of development should decrease the reasons are to prevent landslides and erosion and sedimentation resulting from excessive stripping and cutting of land this in turn causes siltation of streams and the clogging up of drainage structures along roads which will intensify flooding in the township iii areas characterized by soil classified as having severe problems by the soil conservation service this is land often characterized by high water table poor bearing capacity high erosion factors or incapable of supplying water special treatment is necessary to prevent health hazards because of the poor bearing capacity of the soil and the possibility of inadequate water for fire and health reasons iv areas of significant horticultural or conservation features these include mountain ridges valleys vistas and significant horticultural features these areas are valuable because of their beneficial impact in our environment and their importance in the ecological systems development should be designed to preserve these areas v land suitable for specific purposes land suitable for active or passive recreational purposes such as baseball fields tennis courts etc or for other municipal purposes or because of their location such as land adjoining similar lands on abutting properties 2 applicants using cluster to protect the areas listed above should submit designs which generally allow for smaller lots closest to existing roads on flat well drained land larger lots should be platted in areas of increasing slope poorer but still passable percolation and lands closest to flood plains 3 to shall have deeper depths to permit larger back yards and provision for shrubs and trees to serve as buffers e location use and maintenance of dedicated lands  1865 sparta code  1865 a386 1 the planning board shall have full authority to approve or disapprove the location and proposed uses of lands required to be dedicated in accordance with the foregoing 2 dedicated areas proposed to be deeded to the township shall be deeded free and clear of all mortgages and encumbrances 3 if deeded to a property owners

of problems this constitutes an environmental impact statement in evaluating environmental impact the planning board and zoning board of adjustment shall not approve any submission until it determines and finds that the proposed development 1 will not result in appreciable harmful effects to both the natural and aesthetic environments 2 has been designed and conceived with a view toward the protection of the regional resources and energy saving techniques 3 will not place a disproportionate or excessive demand upon the total resources available for such proposal  1865 fee schedule  1865 a387 the term board shall apply to planning board and zoning board of adjustment as appropriate throughout the remainder of the environmental impact statement in order to accomplish these goals the
