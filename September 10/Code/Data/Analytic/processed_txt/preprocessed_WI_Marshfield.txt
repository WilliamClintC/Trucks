existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party ie the abutting landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements d this been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of abutting property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council e in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by d above the

site difficulties if there are unusual site factors which preclude an allowed sign from being visible to the street immediately in front of the site an adjustment may be granted to achieve visibility standards this adjustment is not intended to be used to make signs visible to other streets but to address site difficulties of visibility to the street on which the sign has direct frontage site difficulties may include the sign face being blocked due to topography of the site elevation of street setback of the existing development existing development or landscaping on the site or from abutting development or landscaping this set of adjustment criteria is generally intended to allow greater flexibility in placement and dimension requirements of the sign the adjustment may be approved if the following criteria are found to be met 1 there is no reasonable place on the site for an allowed sign without an adjustment to achieve visibility standards to the street immediately in front of the site 2 if the proposed sign extends into the fivefoot setback requirement the sign will not create a traffic or safety hazard 3 of potential adjustments to meet the visibility standard the request is the most consistent with the surrounding development and sign patterns 4 the adjustment is the minimum needed for a sign to meet the visibility standards 5 additional signage may not constitute an over proliferation of signs on a property or cause needless repetition or redundancy of signage 6 the sign would not be located so as to have a negative impact on adjacent property 7 the size and height adjustment is the minimal to adhere visibility standards c if a proposed sign structure including required landscaped areas would take up required parking spaces and is unable to be suitably placed where setbacks can be met and required parking is not removed the plan commission may reduce or waive the setbacks and landscaping requirement d signs where an alternative sign permit is specifically required elsewhere in this chapter such as an offpremises multiple freestanding signs on one lot marquee mural or temporary sign may not need to meet all of the above criteria for

department of natural resources under s nr  wis adm ord 127  findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding ord 127  purpose and intent 1 purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to a further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions b prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth c control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property 2 intent it is the intent of the city of marshfield that this ordinance regulates postconstruction storm water discharges to waters of the state this ordinance may be applied on a sitebysite basis the city of marshfield recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the storm water performance standards set forth in this ordinance is preparation and
