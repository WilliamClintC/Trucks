establishments footnotes  1  state law reference obscene material performances etc minn stats   et seq authority purpose and intent a authority the united states supreme court has ruled that sexually explicit speech including nude dancing is entitled to some level of protection under the first amendment to the united states constitution as a result municipalities may not ban adult establishments the supreme court has ruled however that cities may adopt contentneutral zoning and licensing provisions to regulate and control the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments on the community b findings of the city council the state attorney generals office and the cities of st paul alexandria and rochester minnesota as well as indianapolis indiana  phoenix arizona  los angeles california  seattle washington  st croix county wisconsin  and adams county colorado  have conducted studies of the impact of adult establishments on their respective communities these studies have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods those impacts include increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks the city council is relying on these studies many of which were conducted in larger cities recognizing that the same or similar adverse impacts could occur in a small city such as the city of east bethel the findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located based on these studies the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult establishments 1 adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth in subsection b of this section 2 the adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by location and licensing requirements 3 the city may adopt regulations to promote the public health safety morals and general welfare 4 the public health safety morals and general welfare will be promoted by regulations governing adult establishments 5 adult establishments can contribute to increased criminal activity and police calls in the area in which they are located taxing law enforcement services 6 adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity the experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses however can minimize this risk 7 adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food andor drink on the same premises 8 many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses 9 the adverse impact that adult establishments have on the surrounding area diminishes as the distance from the adult establishments increases 10 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult establishments a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 11 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 12 the barring of individuals with sexually related criminal convictions from the management of adult establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which may lead to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 13 the general health safety and welfare of the community is promoted by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments this prohibition is based on concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases exposure to minors obscenity and unsanitary conditions in public places 14 small cities experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult establishments present in larger communities c purpose it is the purpose of this article to regulate adult establishments to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to 1 prevent criminal activity within the city  2 to allow for efficient and effective law enforcement services in the city  3 prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and the consequent adverse effects on real estate values of properties within those neighborhoods  4 to locate adult establishments away from residential areas schools parks and places of worship  5 to provide a contentneutral objective licensing scheme that allows the city to monitor adult establishments for violations of building and health codes  and 6 prevent ownership of adult establishments by persons with prior relevant criminal convictions d reasonable opportunity the provisions of this article do not prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city this article is not for the purpose of nor is it intended to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including adultoriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to adultoriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adultoriented entertainment to their intended market  952007 definitions the following words terms and phrases when

statutory authorization minn stats   subd 2b provides that municipal subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use such as parks playgrounds trails wetlands or open space and that the municipality may alternatively accept an equivalent amount in cash based upon the undeveloped land value b findings of fact the city council finds that 1 the preservation and development of parks significant natural communities features of significant historical interest playgrounds trails and open space areas within the city are essential to maintaining a healthy and desirable environment for residents and persons employed within the city the presence of parks trails and open space amenities also enhances the value and attractiveness of residential and commercialindustrial developments to landowners developers purchasers employers and employees the city must not only provide for its present citizens but it must also provide for the future 2 new developments place a burden upon the citys parks and open space system new facilities must be developed concurrently with development in order to provide the desired level of service and the quality of the environment for all therefore new developments shall be required to contribute toward the citys park system in rough proportion to the relative burden they will place upon the park system 3 the city council recognizes that the need for such parks trails and public open spaces is directly related to the density and intensity of population and development permitted and allowed in the city urban development results in increased population increased intensity of use and greater demands for such public areas and facilities 4 development of land for schools religious institutions or other nonprofit organizations may create additional demand on the citys park and recreational land and facilities the city may create partnerships with these organizations that foster cooperative use of school nonprofit and park properties for recreational activities  881 required dedication a dedication of land or cash 1

wetlands serve a variety of beneficial functions and values wetlands maintain water quality reduce flooding and erosion provide food and habitat for wildlife provide open space and are an integral part of the citys environment wetlands are important physical educational ecological aesthetic recreational and economic assets to the city they are critical to the citys supply of clean drinking water stormwater management and other aspects of health safety and general welfare regulating wetlands and the land uses around them is therefore in the public interest 2 in order to protect wetlands this chapter incorporates by reference the minnesota wetland conservation act of 1991 hereinafter referred to as the wca and any future amendments adopted by the legislature the city has determined that some activities are exempted from the provisions of the wca any activities exempted from the provisions of the wca are also exempted from the requirements of this chapter insofar as they relate to the wca the provisions of this chapter cover all wetlands including those governed by the department of natural resources 3 additional pollution control agency regulations a in addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the state pollution control agency pca has required the city to address potential nonpoint source impacts from future development with the establishment of buffer strip standards to complement the existing stormwater standards a buffer strip is an upland area left in its or restored to its natural nonturf grass state that surrounds a wetland or stormwater pond and reduces negative impacts to wetlands from adjacent development b catchbasins and storm sewers typically collect street and front yard drainage and direct the drainage to an appropriately sized pond for pretreatment prior to discharge to a wetland or water body back yard drainage typically reaches wetlands or water bodies without any pretreatment thereby allowing lawn and garden chemicals sediments pet wastes fertilizer and other types of contaminants to directly impact the receiving water body 4 the city has found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered wetlands exhibit great variations in their overall quality therefore the city has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to protect wetlands based on their needs for their existing quality b purpose through the adoption and enforcement of this chapter the city shall promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this chapter the city seeks to accomplish the following 1 to satisfy the requirements of the wca as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city 2 to satisfy the requirements of the minnesota pca by treating nonpoint source pollution that currently is not treated by ponds primarily back yard drainage and to limit disturbance from adjacent development by utilizing the appropriately sized buffer strip 3 to balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city 4 to promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge groundwater and receive the discharge of groundwater to retain sediment and toxins and to filter nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into the rum and sunrise rivers thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features 5 to provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city 6 to prevent property damage and the losses associated with flood conditions and reduce erosion problems 7 to preserve the natural character of the landscape restoration of wetland ecosystems  10101 scope of application a applicants that have preliminary plat approvals previously obtained or have subdivision approvals
