by increasing the runoff from currently undeveloped land in order to mitigate the flooding problem caused by current development and to prevent future development from creating additional flooding problems the city must construct regional and local drainage facilities b it is the intent of the city to require every person who develops land to mitigate the impacts of that development on the

population is reasonably expected to create a substantial increase in the demand placed upon public facilities including public safety and library facilities the citys existing general public facilities will be inadequate to handle the projected population growth at existing levels of service in order to serve the projected population growth the facilities must be expanded b it is the intent of the city council to require every person who develops land to mitigate the impacts of that development on the citys public facilities the city will therefore require developers to pay a public facility development impact fee that will be used to meet the demand for public facilities created by development c the amount of the public facility development impact fees collected in accordance with this chapter will be limited to the cost of the facilities attributable to new development the amount of the public facility development impact fees collected will not include the cost

impact fee  2004  nonresidential public facility development impact fee required a except as provided in pmc  a public facility development impact fee for a nonresidential building must be paid in an

been issued on or before  however any project with a specific condition imposed upon it to participate in an appropriate general public facilities financing mechanism does not qualify for this exclusion and shall remain subject to the public facility development impact fee  2004  exemptions from and reduction of public facility development impact fee a a developer is entitled to a reduction in the public facility development impact fee required by pmc  and  if the developer constructs public facilities pursuant to a public facilities plan adopted by the city council the public facility development impact fee will be reduced by the amount of engineering and construction costs that would reasonably be incurred by the city in building those same public facilities the amount of the reduction in the public facility development impact fee is subject to the approval of the director of public works prior to construction of the development b if a developer constructs public facilities pursuant to a plan adopted by the city council and if the citys engineering and construction costs to construct those same facilities would have been more than the fee assessed to that developer pursuant to pmc  and  then nothing in this section prevents the city from entering into a reimbursement agreement with that developer subject to the availability of funds c the city manager

space rent control ordinance of the city  att a 2009  purpose and findings a complaints by residents of mobile home parks concerning excessive rents led the city council to conduct hearings and eventually to adopt an ordinance stabilizing the rents charged for spaces in mobile home parks the conditions in the city of palmdale which gave rise to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter still are in existence and are set forth below b mobile home owners unlike apartment residents or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment to purchase a mobile home for which they must rent a space in a mobile home park they have also made investments in maintaining and improving those homes as well as landscaping and exterior improvements to the mobile homes and the rental spaces on which they are located alternative sites for the relocation of mobile homes are difficult to find due to the restrictions on the age size or style of mobile homes permitted in many parks and requirements related to the installation of mobile homes including permits landscaping and site preparation additionally the cost of moving a mobile home is substantial and the risk of damage in moving is significant thus moving a mobile home is not a feasible option if rent becomes excessive c the result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market of mobile home owners and residents their immobility creates an imbalance in the bargaining relationship between park owners and mobile home park residents because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income excessive rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness d the purpose of this

to this subsection or subsections i and j of this section that the noi earned by the mobile home park in the base year provided a just and reasonable return to the park except as otherwise provided in subsection h1 of this section owners shall be entitled to increase the parks base year noi by 75 percent of the percentage increase in the cpi since the base year to the date of submittal of a complete application procedures for determining the mnoi rent increase shall be determined in accordance with this subsection and any regulations adopted by the city 1 for purposes of determining a parks initial mnoi rent increase under this subsection h or under subsection i of this section the base year cpi shall be the average cpi reported by the us department of labor bureau of labor

the prior current year as necessary to provide a fair return in the prior current year as reflected in the boards prior decision shall be used as the base year gross income for the subsequent special rent increase application 3 in the event that there has been an increase of more than three percent in vacancies in the park since the base year calculation of the parks gross income and operating expenses shall be governed as follows a in the event that there has been an increase in vacancies of more than three percent in the park since the base year the city finds that it would be contrary to the purposes of rent stabilization to authorize additional rent increases for occupied spaces in order to offset reductions in income due to increased vacancies which occur because there is not sufficient demand to fill the vacant spaces at the legal rent ceiling in effect allowing additional rent increases for occupied spaces because there are more vacant spaces in a park would allow owners to obtain higher rents from existing residents than it is possible to obtain from the prospective residents whose homes are still mobile and whose options have not been restricted by the process of moving into the park therefore in the event that there has been an increase in vacancies of more than three percent since the base year gross income and operating expenses shall be determined pursuant to subsections g3b and c of this section b gross space rents for the park shall be computed as 97 percent of the gross scheduled rental income for the park based on 100 percent occupancy c calculations of base year and current year operating expenses may be adjusted by the board so that a reasonable comparison of the expenses and charges associated with rented spaces is obtained for the purpose of comparing base year and current year operating expenses and to adjust for variations in operating expenses due to the increased vacancy rate 4 schedule of increases in operating expense where scheduling of rental increases or other calculations require projections of income and expenses because actual data is not available it shall be presumed that operating expenses and management expenses exclusive of property taxes increase at the rate of the increase in the cpi for the applicable year  and that property taxes increase at two percent per year i special rent increase based on modifications to or readjustment of 2005 noi readjusted 2005 mnoi rent increase an owner may rebut the presumption that the parks 2005 noi provided a just and reasonable return at that time and obtain an adjustment of the base year rents by presenting evidence that 1 the parks operating expenses in calendar year 2005 were unusually high or low despite prudent business practices in such instance the board may adjust the calculation of 2005 noi by adjusting the 2005 expenses to reflect the average of the parks expenses over a reasonable period of time or the average of expenses in comparable mobile home parks in 2005  or 2 capital improvements were made in calendar year 2005 that were not reflected in rent increases collected during that year in seeking an increase under this provision the owner shall have the burden of demonstrating that the improvement is completed and operational and submitting evidence of the cost incurred  or 3 unusual repairs were made in calendar year 2005 due to damage caused by uninsured natural events or vandalism  or 4 other expenses in calendar year 2005 were unusually high or low notwithstanding prudent business practices  or 5 the rent during calendar year 2005 was disproportionately low due to the fact that it was not established in an armslength transaction  or 6 the rent during calendar year 2005 was low when compared to rents being charged in comparable mobile home parks in the city and comparable mobile home parks in comparable surrounding areas  or 7 the rent during calendar year 2005 was not sufficient to provide a just and reasonable return in calendar year 2005 year the park owner shall have the burden of proving the existence of one or more of the circumstances listed in subsections i1 7 of this section by a preponderance of evidence and shall have the burden of providing reliable and credible evidence of the rents operating expenses gross income noi capital improvement costs existence and justification for finding of comparable rents and comparable parks and the return resulting in the determination that a readjustment or modification to the 2005 noi is warranted j special rent increase based on fair return an owner may rebut the presumption that the increased calculations provided in subsection h of this section and modified calculations provided by subsection i of this section are sufficient to provide a just and reasonable return by presenting evidence that the return being earned by the mobile home park is not just and reasonable as set forth in this section and the regulations adopted from time to time by resolution of the city council the owner shall have the burden of proving the park is not earning a just and reasonable return by a preponderance of evidence in reviewing the evidence and making its determination the board shall consider all relevant information including but not limited to 1 the purchase price of the park  2 any capital improvements made in the park by the owner  3 the return earned by the park  4 the return earned by comparable mobile home parks  and 5 the mobile home parks pattern of income and expenses over each of the past five years including any unavoidable increases or decreases in maintenance repairs and other operating expenses including but expressly not limited to deferred maintenance or substantial deterioration in the mobile home park other than as the result of normal wear and tear k it is the intent of this chapter that a rent increase be approved under this section only when the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that such a rent increase is necessary to provide the owner with a fair return l an owner may charge less than the special rent increase approved by the board subject to the following 1 an owner may phase in a special rent increase approved by the board or hearing officer but at time of the initial phasing the owner shall serve notice of the phasing plan to each affected

3 at no time shall any special rent increase be imposed on any space such that the total rent paid by the resident in any one month exceeds the new rent reflected in the decision of the board or hearing officer 4 if an owner decides to phase in an approved special rent increase or to charge less than the approved special rent increase the owner shall not thereafter demand charge or collect any portion of any uncollected special rent increase for any retroactive period of time no retroactive recovery of any portion of a special rent increase not previously collected from a resident shall be recoverable by the owner no phasing plan shall include any retroactive recovery of any uncollected special rent increases and a phasing plan shall operate prospectively only 5 in evaluating a subsequent special rent increase application under this section the new space rents determined by the board or hearing officer as necessary to provide the owner with a fair return in the most recent prior special rent increase shall be included in determining the base year gross income for purposes of calculating the subsequent special rent increase subject to the provisions of subsection h3 of

forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the floodplain administrator to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring structures built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2002  appeal board a the city council shall hear and decide appeals from decisions made by the floodplain administrator and requests for variances from the requirements of this section b the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter c in passing upon such applications the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2002   1987  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new developments to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided that the procedures of pmc  been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in pmc  to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a d of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety g upon consideration of the factors of pmc  and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter h any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the city in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of

complexity or the nature of their anticipated impacts require comprehensive planning in order to meet the goals of the general plan a comprehensive development plan may be either a specific plan or a planned development depending on the size and complexity of the project as described in this of a comprehensive development plan is appropriate for largescale mixeduse projects which are expected to be built in phases over a long period of time  projects which because of topographic environmental or infrastructural constraints require flexible development standards in order to achieve superior design and minimize adverse impacts  projects in which coordination of multiple owners is required to achieve a longrange development or land use plan  and projects requiring the coordination of land use planning with planning for infrastructure public safety circulation open space resource conservation housing or other development issues as identified in the general plan policies the review process for comprehensive development plans provides a method to identify development constraints and opportunities applicable to a specific site and to tailor the development regulations to the site in order to achieve a more efficient use of the land and high quality of design this process would result in adoption of a specific plan or planned development as described in this a review of a

comprehensive plans to provide these facilities exist  and 2 the proposed mix and intensity of land uses and their relationship to the project site warrant consideration of special development standards and criteria beyond those otherwise provided in the zoning   and 3 specific development plans for each portion of the subject property are not known at the time of project review but are anticipated to be submitted subsequently as the project develops in conformance with the approved comprehensive development plan  and 4 due to the longterm nature of the project and the cost of providing substantial infrastructure improvements an implementation plan addressing financing phasing and maintenance of public improvements is necessary to ensure the project is developed in accordance with the general plan b general provisions 1 a specific plan may be proposed within any zone districts provided that the proposed type and intensity of use is consistent with the general plan 2 a specific plan should typically be utilized for projects of over one hundred sixty 160 acres in area comprehensive planning for smaller areas may be more appropriately accomplished planned

users from outside the area the zone is intended for largescale commercial uses which are developed pursuant to a comprehensive plan although smaller businesses such as autorelated and food service uses are permitted in conjunction with larger developments in this zone the intent is to achieve unified and cohesive commercial centers rather than allowing piecemeal development or land subdivisions which could preclude future attraction of major users  locational criteria the c4 zone designation is appropriately located based upon the following criteria a the area is occupied or will be occupied by stores and businesses which provide retail sales and services for a wide range of consumer needs characterized by relatively longterm utility and a regional service area b the area is located at the intersection of major arterials or highways and is easily accessible to users throughout the region c the area is relatively flat free from environmental constraints and public safety hazards has physical conditions which can sustain largescale commercial development and has adequate infrastructure to support the proposed intensity of uses d the area contains adequate area to accommodate regional commercial uses typically forty 40 or more acres within the zone designation e the location shall be consistent with the general plan commercial siting criteria and other applicable policies and the land use designation of rc regional commercial  special development requirements a in order to meet the intent and purpose of the c4 zone as stated in pmc  provisions should be made in the planning process for integrated development plans which coordinate the efforts of multiple property owners and discourage piecemeal development master planning of the c4 zoned property is required to avoid development in a manner which would prevent or preclude future development of surrounding land in accordance with general plan policies for regional commercial development therefore development in the c4 zone shall be processed in accordance with a master plan which may take one of the following forms 1 a specific plan or a planned development pursuant to pmc  or  2 a comprehensive conditional use permit pursuant to pmc 3 an area plan or other comprehensive development program determined by the planning director to meet the intent of the c4 zone district b regardless of the procedure by which a master plan for development is processed in the c4 zone such a plan shall address the following considerations 1 the area of the master plan should be based on logical planning boundaries and site conditions rather than limited by individual parcel lines 2 the master plan should consider shared access reciprocal parking shared open space and amenity areas the relationship of buildings to each other on adjacent parcels and other design features to optimize use of the entire planning area as a functional unit 3 at a minimum the master plan should address conceptual building locations heights and footprints  overall circulation ingress and egress  parking layout  conceptual grading and drainage  and areas for common use 4 a statement of intent regarding building design andor conceptual elevations should be provided to indicate architectural style product types form and materials 5 for larger projects design guidelines should be developed to guide future individual building developers and maintain the integrity of the master plan concept c future development within the area of a master plan may vary from the provisions of the plan provided that the proposed project is compatible with the overall plan concept or develops an acceptable alternative master plan  uses permitted without planning approval refer to pmc land use matrix zoning adopted by city

services serves the public interest the city council further finds that circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are extremely difficult to discern and that specified findings to guide the analysis promotes clarity and the citys legitimate interest in wellplanned wireless facilities deployment therefore if any applicant demonstrates that strict compliance with any provision in this as applied to a specific proposed personal wireless services facility would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services the planning commission may grant a limited one 1 time
