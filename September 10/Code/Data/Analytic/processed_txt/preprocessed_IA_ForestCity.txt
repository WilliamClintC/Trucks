pathways are defined as being one of three categories the categories which in turn generally define the function and location of the trail with respect to existing roadways are defined as follows atype 1 trail a trail or shared use pathway adjacent to or in close proximity to the roadway this type of trail functions similar to a sidewalk along rural roadways these trailspathways are typically located at the top of the fore slope these trails pathways are generally used for transportation purposes btype 2 trail a trail or shared use pathway located within an independent right of way or not in close proximity to a roadway this type of trail also functions as a transportation route to facilitate and fulfill basic life needs and provide a safe route for nondrivers ctype 3 trail a trail or shared use pathway located within an independent right of way or not in close proximity to a roadway although this type of pathway i trail may fulfill a transportation function these trails primarily serve a recreation and fitness benefit 7length the length of the trail or pathway will be as generally determined by the city council upon identification of the terminus points the exact length will be determined course of the trail design 8width the typical trail width is 10 feet to accommodate twoway traffic trail width may be reduced to 8 feet where the following conditions prevail abicycle traffic volumes are expected to be low bpedestrian use is generally not expected chorizontal and vertical alignments provide welldesigned passing and resting opportunities dthe trail will not be regularly subjected to maintenance vehicle loading conditions ea physical constraint exists for a short durationlength such as a utility structure fence etc trail widths between 8 feet and 5 feet should be avoided and will not be allowed unless otherwise approved by the city engineer or city council trails less than 5 feet in width do not meet ada requirements and shall not be allowed

slope not exceeding 5% where ever possible btype 2 trails grades for type 2 trails shall be less than or equal to 5% and all other type 3 trail requirements should be met ctype 3 trails grades for type 3 trails are a function of terrain and design bicycle speed of the trail a minimum design speed of 18 mph should be used unless posted for slower speeds or in areas of steeper decline in which case the design speed should be adjusted per table a below table a minimum design speed and horizontal alignment  terrain design speed mph minimum radius 1 horizontal curve  feet grades less than 2%

the minimum radius of curvature negotiable by a bicycle can be calculated using the lean angle of the bicyclist or the superelevation and coefficient of friction of the trail the minimum radii of

trail user and the vehicle driver that each facility is independent of the other this is particularly important at night if the separation distance from the face of the curb or the edge of the traveled way to the linear edge of the trail is less than 5 feet a barrier or railing is recommended the barriers or railings need not be of the size and strength to redirect errant motorists unless a crashworthy barrier is needed due to high vehicular traffic speeds and clear zone requirements barriers serving only as a separation device should be the height of a standard guardrail 16lateral and vertical clearance guidelines for lateral and vertical clearance are important in order to develop safe and comfortable trail facilities by providing adequate clearance from a wide of variety of

fixed and movable obstructions a 2 foot minimum graded area with a  maximum cross slope ie shoulder area should be provided for clearance from lateral obstructions such as trees poles and bridge abutments measured from the edge of the trail if a barrier or rail is necessary minimum of 1 foot lateral offset from the edge of the trail is desirable barriers terminating within 2 feet of the trail should be marked with object markers bvertical clearances to overhead obstructions the minimum vertical clearance to a trail is 10 feet in situations such as tunnels and bridge underpasses the vertical clearance should be greater than 10 feet in order to accommodate maintenance and emergency vehicles in a constrained area the vertical clearance may be reduced to a minimum of 8 feet
