benefit of the residents and other users the conservation of natural landscape features provision of affordable housing employment opportunities variety in land use patterns and more efficient provision of services and utilities 23 designated housing types city of gunnison land development code 3 2 in a pud the various land use elements are designed so that they interrelate cohesively with

execution of proper grading involve certain basic steps pertaining to street layout block grading and lot grading the objective is to establish the street grades floor elevations and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to existing topography considering property protection and use the basic steps are as follows 1 fit to topography if the street layout is still subject to design or adjustment fit it to the topography to obtain the most favorable types of block and lot grading which are compatible with other objectives 2 block and lot grading determine type of block grading for each block or portion of a block and if possible indicate the general lot grading for each lot by drainage arrows 3 easements determine any easements and other provisions needed for adequate block drainage and erosion control 4 general limitations determine general lot grading limitations for local conditions such as minimum gradients for grass swales and slopes and maximum for sidewalks and driveways 5 specific limitations for each type of house and lot determine the specific lot grading limitations along a typical lot grading control line from the street to the house and determine the minimum streettofloor rise 6 street profiles if the street profiles are to be designed or adjusted establish them so as to facilitate the provision of good drainage for both the lots and the streets
