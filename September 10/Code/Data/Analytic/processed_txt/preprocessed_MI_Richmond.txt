standards the purpose of design and performance standards is to protect water quality to keep pollutants from entering surface and groundwater to reduce the danger of contamination and to protect potable water supplies performance standards regulate development within the whpa by enforcing specific standards for facility design and construction they allow for aggressive protection of the whpa by striving for quality development within the whpa performance standards can be complex to administer they require considerable evaluation and analysis to determine the relative impact to the whpa all design and performance standards should be prepared by registered professional engineers the following standards will apply to uses in the whpa 1 cooling systems any cooling water from solvent recovery systems should be free of contamination from solvent metals or other pollutants and should not be discharged to the ground closedloop cooling systems are encouraged to eliminate cooling water discharges cooling water may be discharged into a storm sewer sanitary sewer or stream provided all federal state and local requirements are met 2 construction activities appropriate maintenance and equipment storage areas must be identified on the site plan where possible before any construction is done on the site if construction equipment is to be stored in an open area ie temporary storage  the site should not be within the drip line of trees  the site should not be within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland runoff should be diverted away from watercourses and wetlands  special measures must be taken to prevent excess solids suspended in storm water from being discharged from the site  all applicable state and local soil erosion requirements must be met  the maintenance repair cleaning and storage of construction machinery vehicles and equipment should be confined to areas specifically designed and designated for that purpose this practice includes both open and covered equipment maintenance and storage areas and emphasizes the importance of controlling runoff from both kinds of storage areas this practice should be implemented at all equipment maintenance and storage areas and whenever construction will be ongoing long enough that construction equipment will need to be stored serviced maintained or repaired on a construction site appropriate equipment maintenance and storage sites should be identified before any actual construction begins heavy equipment should be well maintained to prevent leaks  make sure waste materials are properly disposed of  outside equipmentmaintenance storage areas should be inspected daily to ensure equipment isnt being stored within the drip line of trees and to ensure the vehicles and equipment arent leaking periodic checks of the equipment wash area should also be done to ensure it is not failing additional stone may be needed to maintain the wash area  construction sites must provide facilities for containing any accidental losses of oil or other polluting substances and comply with the approved equipment maintenance and storage areas as identified on the site plan  at the conclusion of construction stabilize the surrounding area 3 crossconnections crossconnections such as sanitary discharges to storm sewers storm water discharges to sanitary sewers or floor drain discharges to storm sewer systems are prohibited 4 debris no potentially polluting material such as garbage trash refuse junk vehicles junk appliances or toxic substances may be dumped or stored outside a protected structure or container within the whpa 5 floor drains floor drain discharges to the ground septic systems except in sanitary facilities storm sewers or any surface water body from any location in the facility is prohibited floor drains in bathrooms kitchens and other sanitary facilities must either discharge to a septic system a municipal sanitary sewer or a holding tank which is periodically pumped out floor drains in work areas must be connected either to a holding tank with a gravity discharge pipe or to a collection sump which discharges to a holding tank floor drains are prohibited in rooms where boilers or emergency generators are housed 6 holding tanks interior hazardous substance storage tanks should have 110 percent secondary containment doublewalled construction alarms and overfill protection interior storage tanks should be installed in an enclosed area isolated from floor drains storm water sewers or other conduits which may cause a release into the environment for flood control all exterior aboveground tanks will include but not be limited to a monitoring system and secondary standpipe above the 100year flood control level for monitoring and recovery all aboveground tanks must have an impervious dike above the 100year flood level capable of containing 110 percent of the largest volume of storage and be provided with an overflow recovery catchment area or sump fillpipe inlets should be above the elevation of the top of the storage tank tanks and associated appurtenances should be tested periodically for structural integrity 7 liquid waste ponds open liquid waste ponds are prohibited 8 loading and unloading areas areas where hazardous substances and waste materials are loaded and unloaded should be enclosed or roofed areas with secondary containment should be isolated from floor drains to prevent potential spills from contaminating storm water or discharging to the ground loading and unloading areas must have impervious surfaces and be designed to prevent releases from incidental handling 9 material handling and storage areas material handling and storage areas for hazardous substances and waste materials should be permanently roofed completely confined within secondary confinement berms isolated from floor drains have sealed surfaces and should not be accessible to unauthorized personnel compatible drum and container storage areas should be located together for better control of hazardous substances and waste inventory 10 parking lots this design standard is intended to provide review criteria for parking areas so that approved construction techniques will prevent solids and contaminates from reaching groundwater and is applicable for nearly all parking areas the primary purpose for proper performance of parking lot design is to reduce peak runoff and provide some flood storage this helps reduce surface flushing and subsequent contamination parking lots can essentially function as specialized detention basins as such they should comply with the design and performance standards described under storm water management 11 secondary containment any facility involving the collection handling manufacture use storage transfer or disposal of any solid or liquid material or wastes which has the potential to contaminate groundwater must have a secondary containment system whose purpose is to intercept any leak or release from the primary containment vessel or structure containment systems must be accessible to allow for easy inspection secondary containment must be equivalent to 110 percent of the maximum amount of materials to be stored and be sufficient to retain the substance for the maximum anticipated time necessary for recovery and cleanup underground tanks or buried pipes carrying such materials must have double walls and inspectable sumps 12 septic systems and dry wells leach fields must be sized according to soil characteristics and hydraulic and pollutant loadings excessively sized septic system leach fields may cause reduced effectiveness if normal flows are inadequate to maintain a biologically active clogging layer throughout the leach field septic systems are not recommended in areas with karst fractured cavernous volcanic or any other highly permeable subsurface formation additional detention times for septic tanks and larger buffer zones around leach fields should be considered in septic system design all septic tank installations should be designed with provisions for sampling at the outlet baffle gas baffles should be installed at the outlet dry wells are prohibited unless they are only clean water discharges that meet all established minimum contaminant levels promulgated under the safe drinking water act and other state and federal standards for drinking water and meets all other state and local requirements flow restrictions and lowflow faucets for sinks and spray nozzles should be installed to minimize hydraulic loading to subsurface disposal systems 13 site design the project and related improvements must be designed to protect the natural environment there must be no impairment pollution andor destruction of water natural resources and the public trust earthen berms should be used to limit contact with the ground in spillprone areas specific areas should be designated and maintained for employee parking if equipment is to be stored in an open area ie temporary storage  the site should not be within the drip line of trees  the site should not be within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland runoff should be diverted away from watercourses and wetlands if equipment is to be maintained and stored in a permanent structure ie building the building should not be located within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland under no circumstances should buildings or equipment be located in flood plains stream beds or the channel of any watercourse equipment wash areas should discharge into a holding tank or sanitary sewer line depending on the amount of oil grease and other pollutants pretreatment of wastewater may be needed before it enters the sanitary sewer wash areas should be constructed of two to threeinch stone or other approved material with a minimum sixinch base they should be underlain with geotextile materials and protected using berms or diversions to prevent the runoff water from leaving the site secondary containment should be incorporated into the design of the maintenancestorage facility to contain spills from all hazardous materials buildings should be clustered as much as possible to retain open space surrounding vegetation tree cover and to minimize changes in topography minimum setback distances should be established between limits of septic systems dry wells holding tanks leach fields and wellheads distances should be based on information such as percolation tests zones of influence of leachate mounding wellhead protection areas and time of travel 14 storm water management storm water management must comply with all applicable federal state and local requirements storm water management and drainage facilities require special design requirements for highrisk areas such as whpas they must be designed to take advantage of existing natural retention and storage capacity of wetlands and water bodies or water courses and not increase flooding or the potential for environmental contamination the preferred strategy for storm water management is storage treatment and controlled surface water discharge treatment and infiltration may be employed as a storm water strategy if the site constraints prohibit the uses of the preferred strategy treatment refers to the planned use of natural and man made mechanisms to purify storm water out of solids separation and capture of oil and grease absorption of particulates and uptake of dissolved solids treatment of storm water is required prior to infiltration or controlled surface water discharge a surface water outlet is recommended when available the preferred management strategy consisting of storage treatment and controlled surface water discharge includes dual cell onsite detention basins extended dual cell detention basins or wet dualcell detention basins the secondary management strategy consisting of treatment and infiltration includes discharge to storm sewers catch basins oil and grit separators infiltration trenches lined grass swales or dual cell infiltration basins storm water contact with hazardous substances and waste materials must be avoided to the greatest extent possible storage of hazardous substances and waste materials should be isolated in roofed or enclosed areas to prevent contact with precipitation if exposure of storage areas to the elements is allowed uncovered storage areas should have a separate storm water collection system which discharges to a holding tank storm water from building roofs may be discharged to the ground however if solvent distillation equipment or vapor degreasing is used with a vent that exhausts to the roof then roof leaders may become cross contaminated with solvent these potential sources of cross contamination must be avoided crossconnections such as sanitary discharges to storm sewers storm water discharges to sanitary sewers or floor drain discharges to storm sewer systems are prohibited water from floor sumps may not be discharged to a storm sewer or stream runoff from equipment maintenancestorage areas should be directed to stabilized outlets designed to assimilate the volume and type of pollutants discharged to them 15 underground storage tanks underground storage tanks must comply with all applicable federal and state requirements underground storage tanks should not be used unless explicitly required by fire codes or other federal state or local regulations where underground tanks are required they should have doublewalled construction or secondary containment such as a concrete vault lined or sealed with an impermeable material and filled with sand both types of tanks should have appropriate secondary containment monitoring high level and leak sensing audiovisual alarms level indicators and overfill protection if a dip stick is used for level measurements there should be a protective plate or basket where the stick may strike the tank bottom for flood control all underground facilities will include but not be limited to a monitoring system and secondary standpipe above the 100year flood control level for monitoring and recovery 16 utilities where piping for utilities conduits ducts etc extend floor of any floors at or below grade the openings must be sealed with chemical resistant non cracking caulk 17 waste stream waste management techniques must comply with all applicable federal state and local requirements wastegenerating operations should be physically segregated from other operations and preferably be located within a confinement area with sealed floors and with no direct access outside the facility this reduces the total work area exposed to solvents facilitates waste stream segregation and efficient material and waste handling and minimizes cross contamination with other operations and potential pathways for release into the environment waste collection stations should be provided throughout work areas for the accumulation of spent chemicals soiled rags etc each station should have labeled containers for each type of waste fluid this provides safe interim storage of wastes reduces frequent handling of small quantities of wastes to storage areas and minimizes the overall risk of a release into the environment 18 work areas sealed floors are easier to clean without the use of solvents all floors should be constructed of cement or other impervious materials to prevent contaminants from leaching into the soils or groundwater floor surfaces in work areas and chemical storage areas should be sealed with an impermeable material resistant to acids caustics solvents oils or any other substance which may be used or generated at the facility work area floors should be pitched to appropriate floor drains if floor drains are not used or if they are located close to entrance ways then entrances must be designed to prevent storm water runoff from entering the building curbing and internal floor berms should be used to isolate floor drains from spillprone areas i 82106 site plan review standards the public service director is hereby appointed the whpa administrator to administer and implement the provisions of the city of richmond whpa ordinance the public service director is responsible for reviewing site plans within the whpa for compliance with the provisions of the whpa ordinance the public service director

potential for crashes on the number spacing placement and design of access points numerous published reports and recommendations by the michigan department of transportation mdot and other transportation organizations have identified a direct correlation between the number of access points and the number of crashes those studies also demonstrate that appropriate standards on the number and placement of access points driveways and side street intersections can preserve the capacity of a major corridor like gratiot avenue whose primary function is to move traffic with a secondary function to provide reasonable access to properties along the road the standards herein are based on recommendations published by various national and michigan agencies that were refined during preparation of the gratiot avenue corridor improvement plan further these regulations are intended to protect the substantial public investment in the road system and helps avoid the need for costly reconstruction which causes traffic congestion with associated emissions and disrupts businesses the procedures outlined in this section are intended to promote a more coordinated and expedited

do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners and a lesser variance than requested will not give substantial relief to the applicant or be consistent with justice to other property owners 3 the need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the land or structures involved that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district 4 the problem and resulting need for the variance has not been selfcreated by the applicant or the applicants predecessors 5 the variance will not cause significant adverse impacts to adjacent properties the neighborhood or the city and will not create a public nuisance or materially impair public health safety comfort morals or welfare 6 the alleged hardship and practical difficulties that will result from a failure to grant the variance include substantially more than mere inconvenience or an inability to attain a higher financial return b use variances the granting of a variance from

permitted in the zoning district 2 the landowners plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to general neighborhood conditions circumstances common to the larger neighborhood may reflect the unreasonableness of the zoning itself which should be addressed rezoning or other legislative action 3 the use variance if granted would not alter the essential character of the neighborhood this standard requires consideration of whether the intent and purpose of the ordinance and zoning district will be preserved and the essential character of the area will be maintained 4 the hardship is not the result of the applicants actions under this standard the bza must determine that the hardship that led to the use variance request was not selfcreated by the applicant purchase of a property with a preexisting hardship does not constitute a selfcreated hardship financial hardships that would prevent reasonable use of the property shall be considered but shall not be the only determining factor in granting a use variance  exceptions to hear and decide requests for exceptions and other matters upon which this article specifically authorizes the board
