professional engineer the city of holbrook recommends discussing all proposed development submittals with city staff prior to preparation or submittal of a reporta design frequencies for drainage improvements are as follows a the city of holbrook will normally accept the following technical procedures for the estimation of design discharges the navajo county stormwater design criteria the arizona department of transportation adot highway drainage design manual and appropriate fema guidelines should be used for guidance when utilizing the following methods 1 rational methodthis method is for small urban watersheds less than 160 acres and with fairly uniform land use use of this method will produce peak discharges and runoff volumes and should not be used for more complex watersheds this method is normally used to size drainage structures for the peak discharge of a selected return period 2 tr55technical release no 55 urban hydrology for small watersheds was developed to provide solutions for a wide variety of small watershed hydrology problems including computation of peak discharge hydrograph generation reach routing and detention storage estimates for more complex watersheds and modeling tr55 is recommended 3 hec1this method is the us army corp of engineers rainfall runoff model it should be used for modeling larger more complex watersheds or drainage networks it is suggested that the coefficients to be utilized in the hbc i model be thoroughly reviewed prior to utilizing any hbc i options the scs type ii 24hour storm distributions with antecedent moisture condition ii shall normally be used b other hydrologic methods such as the soil conservation service scs technical release 20 tr20 will normally be accepted the use of these methods must conform to the procedures outlined in the scs manual a detention is not required for developments of 1 acre in size or less or with an impervious area of less than 15000 square feet b when preparing plans utilizing onsite detention the engineer should consider the impact of the retarded peak release rates on flows from upper portions of larger drainage basins that is the analysis should evaluate how the detained runoff will impact the overall basin discharge rate c whenever stormwater detention or other methods are employed to hold runoff to historic levels the analysis shall address the effects of the 2year 25year and 100year events regardless of the calculation method utilized to analyze the detention it will be necessary to illustrate the runoff is held to historic levels during the 2year and 25year 24hour events the detention facility must have adequate capacity to convey the 100year event detention structure without overtopping but flows will not have to be maintained to preexisting flow rates no freeboard on the ponds will be required the adequacy of the system to convey the 100 year event flow rates will be considered adequate freeboard d runoff from small basins typically those less than 10 acres in size may be analyzed using the modified rational method as described in design methods for the design of the detention facilities urban stormwater management or practices in detention of urban stormwater runoff detention basins for drainage areas ranging in size from 10 acres to 40 acres in size may be designed using the methods as outlined in scs tr  55 e it is the citys policy that onsite detention only be utilized when it will provide the necessary beneficial affect reducing runoff to historic levels or to hold runoff to the capacity of critical downstream facilities whenever onsite detention is proposed a method of providing long term maintenance of the facility shall be established the maintenance responsibility resides with the property owner or an established property owners association the city of holbrook will not be responsible for the maintenance or private detention facilities 522 improvement guidelines type of facility structure type

flow over the road for the structure design frequency 523 hydrology methods 524 storm water detention cases may be encountered where onsite detention facilities would actually increase the discharge in the receiving stream or would have no beneficial effect when such cases are encountered the hydrological analysis should be included together with an explanation and request that the onsite detention requirements should be waived due to its detrimental effect on the receiving stream it is suggested that a more thorough analysis such as the hec1 or tr20 method be utilized whenever more complex basins are involved the rational method and tr55 methods are simplified approximations that are only applicable to the most straightforward applications chapter 6  planning and zoning codified

of variances 892 appeal board 893 conditions for variances 891 nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of holbrook to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 892 appeal board a the floodplain board of holbrook shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this in passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this  1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in paragraph 892 f of this notice will also state that the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of land pursuant to any flood relocation and land exchange program a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office the navajo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of the title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency g generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items in c 111 have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases h upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request 893 conditions for variances a variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure b variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result c variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief d variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 a showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in of this the definition of functionally dependent use 4 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in e of this notice will also state that the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of land pursuant to any flood relocation and land exchange
