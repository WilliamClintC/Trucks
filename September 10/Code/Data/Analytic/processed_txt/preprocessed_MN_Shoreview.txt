shoreview municipal  licensing adult entertainment 7121 712 adult entertainment  findings and recitals aon  the city council enacted an interim ordinance  creating a moratorium on the establishment of adult uses within the city and directing the city staff to conduct a study to determine how best to regulate such uses the scope of the study was to include but not be limited to the following 1 the particular zoning districts in which adult establishments should be allowed as either permitted or conditional uses  2 the density and concentration of adult uses  and 3 the effect of adult uses on other uses in the surrounding area upon completion of the study the matter was to be considered by the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council the study has been completed and the planning commission has reviewed the study and has passed its recommendation to the city council for review the city council has also reviewed the staffs study and duly considered the recommendation of the planning commission b the staffs study contained copies of certain reports specifically including a report which was prepared by the state attorney general entitled report of the attorney generals working group on regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  the report the report considered evidence from studies conducted in minneapolis st paul and many other cities throughout the country relating to sexually oriented businesses the city staff planning commission and city council have reviewed the report c the report based upon the above referenced studies and the testimony and evidence it concluded among other things     that sexually oriented businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values    prior to the issuance of the report the state attorney generals working group also heard testimony that     the character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexually oriented businesses adjacent to residential property the report found and concluded that 1 adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses  city of shoreview municipal  licensing adult entertainment 7122 2 residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters bookstores and other adult uses experience increase crime rates sexrelated crimes in particular lowered property values increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  3 the adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult uses increases  4 studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes prostitution child molestation indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  5 the city of phoenix arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexually oriented businesses  6 many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are located as less desirable than other areas which do not have such uses  7 studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity to adult uses  and 8 the indianapolis indiana study established that professional real estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a one to three block area of the store dthe shoreview city council finds the characteristics of shoreview are substantially similar to those of the cities cited by the report when considering the affects of adult uses e the shoreview city council finds based upon the report and the studies cited therein that adult uses may have adverse secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city and that the public health safety and general welfare will be promoted if the city adopts regulations regarding adult uses f the shoreview city council finds that the adverse secondary effects tend to diminish if adult uses in the city are regulated by locational and licensing requirements git is not the intent of the city to prohibit adult uses from having a reasonable opportunity to locate within the city city of shoreview municipal  licensing adult entertainment 7123 hthe citys current zoning ordinance does not address such adult uses which have been found by other municipalities to cause similar adverse secondary effects specifically the city council is concerned that the citys zoning ordinance may be inadequate in its scope and in its restrictions to accomplish the purpose for which it was intended i in addition to the proper zoning classification of such uses there are a number of significant planning and land use issues pertaining to the regulation of such uses including the following 1 the particular zoning districts in which such uses should be allowed as either permitted or conditional uses 2 the concentration and density of such uses in the city and its neighborhoods 3 the effect of such uses on other uses in the surrounding area  definitions for the purposes of this ordinance the following terms shall be defined as set forth
