restrictions l recitals findin gs and intent a recitals i whereas after reviewing and discussing examples of sex offender residency restriction ordinances from several other cities towns and villages including maps of prohibited locations for the residency of sex offenders corresponding to such ordinances the locations of places where children are known to congregate in the village after several public meetings the village board adopted the first version of this ordinance on june 18201 2 whereas the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin issued an order on  in the case titled hoffman v village of pleasant prairie which contained holdings that directly impact the terms of the villages municipal l1216 and make it necessary to amend the terms of this comply with the district courts holdings 3 whereas on  and  the villages public safety & healthproperty & grounds committee held public meetings on proposed revisions to the villages sex offender ordinance at these meetings the committee reviewed and discussed the existing ordinance proposed revisions to the existing ordinance revisions to similar ordinances being made by other municipalities and discussed the following written materials 4 order of the honorable jp stadtmueller of the united stated district court eastern district of wisconsin hoffman et al v village of pleasant prairie case no  16cf697jps  5 whereas the village board held a public meeting on  on this ordinance at this meeting the village board reviewed the existing ordinance proposed revisions to the existing ordinance and discussed the same materials as the committee as set forth under subsection 4 above b findings this ordinance is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the village from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences the village board finds and declares that repeat sexual offenders who use physical 6 public nuisances violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety and the health of children sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses  and most sexual offenders commit many offenses have many more victims than are ever reported and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large and the community where they reside while incalculable clearly exorbitant lt is further believed that such persons present an alarmingly high risk of reoffending once released and as such it is better for sex offenders to reside in their home community where their support systems exist rather than in a community where the sex offender may not have a support network the village board finds the risk of recidivism increases if the sex offender recently offended and if the sex offender does not have a strong social network including community and familial ties the village board is aware of many studies and reports concerning recidivism of sex offenders and the effectiveness of sex offender residency restrictions the village board acknowledges that literature on the subject includes some studies that support the practice of sex offender residency restrictions and others that are critical of the practice the village board is also aware that absent a domicile clause the village would have open doors for nonresident sex offender residency when other communities have closed doors inviting a substantial increase in child sex offender placements with the related adverse impacts on the health safety and welfare of the village and its residents as such the village hereby establishes regulations which restrict certain offenders from residing or congregating in areas that are at or near where there is a high concentration of children in order to provide better protection for children in the village by minimizing immediate access and proximity to children and thereby reducing opportunity and temptation for recidivism c lntent lt is expressly not the intent of this impose additional punishment on sex offenders but rather to serve the village of sturtevants compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sex offenders and sex predators are prohibited from establishing residency the village establishes these regulations in order to provide protection to children in the village by minimizing immediate access and proximity to children and thereby reducing opportunity and temptation for recidivism due to the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of reoffense there is a compelling need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places 7 public nuisances 2 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this except when the context

promote improved environmental design in the development of land by allowing greater freedom and flexibility than is possible under the precise and rigid requirements of conventional zoning districts use of objective standards establishing goals and criteria for judgment rather than the application of fixed formula it will permit diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the relationship of uses structures open spaces and heights of strucrures in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects while still requiring substantial compliance to the general plan of development and the underlying zoning classification or classifications its purpose is to encourage more imaginative site planning to assist in achieving more rational and economic development with relationship to public services to permit optimum development of land and to encourage and facilitate the conservation of open land and other natural features such as woods streams wetlands etc as integral components of a balanced ecology 2 mlnimum planned development area to qualify for consideration as a planned development the site shall be of sufficient
