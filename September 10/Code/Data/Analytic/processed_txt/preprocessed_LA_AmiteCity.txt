derived from arts 15 adopted feb 3 1998 statuary authorization findings of fact purpose and methods a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of louisiana has in lrs  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the town council of the town of amite city does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the town of amite city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art i 6110 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common

construction according to the fair import of their words taken in their usual sense in connection with the context and with reference to the purpose of the provision civil remedies not affected

an act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences and which is combined with criminal intent  or 2 a mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences where there is no requirement of criminal intent  or 3 criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences criminal consequences criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this part as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein criminal intent criminal intent may be specific or general 1 specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act 2 general criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender in the ordinary course of human experience must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act criminal intent  how expressed the definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent while in others no intent is required some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences however in the absence of qualifying provisions the terms intent and intentional have reference to general criminal intent criminal negligence criminal negligence exists when although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offenders conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances insanity if the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease or a mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility intoxication the fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial except as follows 1 where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility 2 where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime mistake of fact unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime mistake of law ignorance of the provision of this part is not a defense to any criminal prosecution however mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances 1 where the offender reasonably relied on an act of this municipality in repealing an existing criminal provision or in otherwise purporting to make the offenders conduct lawful  or 2 where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional justification  general provisions the fact that an offenders conduct is justifiable although otherwise criminal shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct this defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances 1 when the offenders conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office  or 2 when the offenders conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful under the laws of the state of louisiana or of this chapter  or 3 when for any reason the offenders conduct is authorized by law  or 4 when the offenders conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents tutors or teachers  or 5 when the crime consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility  or 6 when any crime is committed compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not committed  or 7 when the offenders conduct is in defense of persons or of property under any of the circumstances described in articles 19 of the louisiana criminal   use of force or violence in defense the use of force or violence upon the person of another is justifiable when committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a persons lawful possession  provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent the offense and that this provision shall not apply where the force or violence results in a homicide aggressor cannot claim self defense a person who is the aggressor or who brings on a difficulty cannot claim the right of selfdefense unless he withdraws from the conflict in good faith in a manner that his adversary knows or should know that he desires to withdraw and discontinue the conflict defense of others it is justifiable to use force or violence in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used those means himself and when it is reasonably believed that the intervention is necessary to protect the other person principals all persons concerned in the commission of a crime whether present or absent and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense aid and abet in its commission or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime are principals attempt a any person who having a specific intent to commit a crime does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended  and it shall be immaterial whether under the circumstances he would have actually accomplished his purpose b mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt  but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended c an attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended crime  and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime
