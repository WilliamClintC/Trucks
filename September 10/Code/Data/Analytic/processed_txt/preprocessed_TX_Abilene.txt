urbanism or vertical mixed use into a development to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community and to result in a higher quality development for the community than would result from the use of conventional zoning districts b applicability a pd district may only be established in one or more of the following circumstances 1 the land is located in
