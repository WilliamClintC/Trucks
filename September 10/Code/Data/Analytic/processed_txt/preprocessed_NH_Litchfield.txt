erosion the wearing away of the land surface by the action of wind water or gravity sediment solid material both mineral and organic that is in suspension is being transported or has been moved from

to control runoff erosion or sediment 41 hydrology runoff calculation methods the calculation of runoff is of prime importance to the overall scheme of drainage design the town of litchfield approves four methods to compute runoff a the rational method  this method is usually used when the drainage area is less than 200 acres it is also used extensively for onsite design b the nehlawm method  this method is usually used when the drainage area is greater than one square mile c the potter method  this method is usually used when the drainage area is between 200 and 1000 acres this method provides a check on either of the preceding methods d the soil conservation service scs method  this method can be used when the drainage area is greater than 10 acres the design storm shall be a 10 year or 25
