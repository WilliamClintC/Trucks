purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the village of addison convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent or hisher designee the village of addison may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in ec1a ec1e below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its

from its baseline production rates determined in ec1c upon notification of a revised production rate the superintendent or hisher designee will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to ec1a so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the superintendent or hisher designee a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to g the industrial user must also be in compliance with e3c4a d the superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the

provides local limitations on discharges in permits for categorical and significant industrial users in describes enforcement actions and enforcement response in describes penalties and costs in the enforcement philosophy is progressive  that is problems are intended to be addressed at the lowest level and with the least formality possible consistent with the specific problem however no enforcement procedure is contingent upon the completion of any less formal procedure for particularly severe violations as defined formal enforcement compliance actions may be initiated immediately without the use of letters of violation compliance meeting compliance schedules andor compliance directives of requires that all categorical or significant industrial users obtain a wastewater discharge permit as a condition of discharge permits may be for a period as along as five years and may limit wastewater constituents and flows may require installation and operation of sampling and

of sufficient impact to justify extensive enforcement actions however certain violations or patterns of violations are significant and must be identified as such such significant noncompliance snc may be on an individual or longterm basis of occurrence categorization of industrial users as being in significant noncompliance snc allows addison to establish priorities for enforcement action and

affirmative defenses to discharge violations a upset 1 for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph 3 below are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner

treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b prohibitive discharge standards 1 a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in ba of this the specific prohibitions in bb e not including 2332bb1 and 2332bb3 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the village of addison was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for purposes of this a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent

a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 bypass a bypass is prohibited and the superintendent or hisher designee may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required

residential dwelling units already exist and which is already in the park or school districts that no donation for park or school purposes will be required a criteria for requiring park and land dedication applications for new residential development will be required to dedicate for park and recreation purposes an amount of land determined on the basis of 55 acres per thousand persons calculated as provide in exhibit a table of estimated ultimate population 1 location the location of the site to be dedicated will be determined by the village board upon recommendation of the plan

park and school sites where the resulting site in a proposed subdivision or development is too small to be usable for the purpose intended or where it is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site the village will require an applicant to contribute cash in lieu of the land dedication the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication will be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the village solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified which will serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing park and recreation land which already serves such needs the cash contributions in lieu of school sites will be held by the village or other public body designated by the village solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs including the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto 1 fair market value the cash contribution in lieu of land will be based on the fair market value of the acres of land as improved that otherwise would have been 69 dedicated as park and recreation or school sites it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is $6000000 per acre and such figure will be used in making any calculation herein unless the applicant files a written objection thereto in the event of any such objection the applicant will submit an appraisal showing the fair market value per acre of such improved land upon which a determination will be made by the village board based upon the appraisal and such information from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district school district or others d criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary the occasions will arise when 1 the subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder that portion of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park or school location will be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof will be required for any additional land that would have been
