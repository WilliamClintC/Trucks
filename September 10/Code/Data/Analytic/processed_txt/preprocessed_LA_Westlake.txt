accordingly to accomplish the following 1 maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among the users and users classes as required herein 2 generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance including replacement of the treatment works and meet debt service limits set by the city 3 apply excess revenues collected from users or a class of users to the costs and operation and maintenance fund and adjust the rate accordingly in the following year b review period it shall be the policy of the city to review the user charge system at least once per year to ensure the above general requirements are met it also shall be the policy of the city to review all user rate structures not less than every year to ensure a fair distribution of costs c notification it shall be the policy of the city that each user be notified in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater services d complaints it shall be the policy of the city to formally review complaints on sewer charges to a user or user class at any regularly scheduled city council meeting upon adequate notice e exhibits the following exhibit is a part of this article _____ exhibit a development procedures for determining operating cost user classes and user charge fee for wastewater system of city of westlake louisiana a general the environmental protection agency epa requires that all grant recipients adopt a system of charges to assure that each user of the wastewater service pay its proportionate share of costs of operating expenses including replacement of equipment the epa further requires that this user charge system be annually reviewed and revised as needed the user charge system must generate sufficient revenue to offset the cost of the sewerage works operation and the system must be incorporated in a municipal legislative act b capital improvements cost recovery past sewer improvements within the city of westlake have been financed by several methods including the use of general obligation bonds a waterworks and sewerage utility revenue bond federal grants and special assessments on the property currently the only outstanding revenue bond is being paid from the waterworks and sewerage utility fund which receives its funds from water sales sewer sales tiein fees and a sales tax supplement the general obligation bonds are being retired collection of ad valorem taxes c user charge schedule 1 normal use the city currently does not have a metered water system except for large users  therefore a user system based on the establishment of user classes having similar flows and wastewater characteristic is utilized under this system each class is assigned its share of wastewater contribution since there is no industrial waste as such in westlake and the pollutant concentrations discharged by all users are approximately equal the user charges for operation and maintenance costs can be developed using the following equation a formula for computing user charge cu   ctvt  vu where cu   a users charge for o & m per unit of time ct   total o & m costs per unit of time vt   total volumecontribution from all users per unit of time vu   volume contribution from a user per unit of time in order to utilize the above formula a residential customer equivalent is calculated for each user class receiving sewer service the equivalent calculations are based on flow data presented in the west calcasieu wastewater facility plan and available sewage flow guides and serve as the means to distribute the annual o & m costs the residential customer equivalent is based on an average daily base flow of 100 gallons per capita and 34 persons per household in anticipating the annual operating cost requirement it is important to note that the waterworks and sewage utilities are combined in a single utility fund although these services are combined an estimated cost attributed toward sewer service shall be determined with the water and sewer department personnel review of the annual statement of expenses and a depreciation summary of plant facilities contained in the accountants report for the initial projected costs of operation maintenance and replacement the figures for the collection system regional transport system and regional treatment plant are taken from the epa approved step i regional wastewater facility plan c220339 and appropriately indexed utilizing standard cost indexes published by epa the specific details and categorized breakdown of costs can be reviewed by referencing the facility plan a projected annual operating costs for wastewater system by system component are system

excessive pollutant concentrations in the event that pollutant concentrations from a user exceed the normal range of strength of normal domestic sewage bod and ss concentrations of around 200 it is proposed that a surcharge be levied the use of such a surcharge could be necessary if an industry discharging a wastewater having a higher range of strength were located within the city and desired to have wastewater treatment service the surcharge would be by the following formula cs   bcb + scs  vu where cs   surcharge for sewage of excessive strength bc   o & m cost for treatment of a unit of bod b   concentration of bod from a user above a base level of 200 mgl sc   o & m cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids ss s   concentration of ss from a user above a base level of 200 mgl vu   volume concentration from a user per unit of time in the previous equation volume costs per user is automatically accounted for by vu  therefore the total o & m surcharge cost will be considered to be due to either bod or ss assuming that bod accounts for 55% and ss accounts for 45% of an assumed total annual expense of $50000 for treatment only the users cost attributable to each can be calculated as follows bod cost 55% of $5000000   $2750000 per year $ 230000 per year ss cost 45% of $5000000   $2250000 per year $ 190000 per year existing sewage flow excluding infiltration   20 mg

rate and charge calculation is for example purposes only this procedure will be used for actual cases using actual figures d implementation and recommendations of system it is recommended that the above procedures be utilized to develop user fees for wastewater services additionally it is recommended that a corresponding change in the water rate structure be implemented in order to prevent excess revenue and in order to maintain the same relative cost for water and sewer service since the customer equivalents of the user classes were based on estimated flows it is recommended that the city undertake a small project to meter all commercial users this metering would enable the city to help fairly distribute the cost to the users of both water and sewer service this system would also help to encourage water reduction practices which could help to lower the operating cost of both the water and sewer systems it is also recommended that the city allow some consideration for small establishments within the user classes whose actual flow may not reflect the anticipated flow of a typical user within the class under this recommendation it is suggested that the user provide evidence that his water use is less than the flow in the user charge system analysis e user charge schedule wastewater user charge schedule city of westlake 1 residential monthly sewer user a flat

of 1 an act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences and which is combined with criminal intent  2 a mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences where there is no requirement of criminal intent  or 3 criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences criminal consequences criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this part as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein criminal intent criminal intent may be specific or general 1 specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act 2 general criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender in the ordinary course of human experience must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act criminal intent  how expressed the definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent while in others no intent is required some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences however in the absence of qualifying provisions the terms intent and intentional have reference to general criminal intent criminal negligence criminal negligence exists when although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offenders conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances intoxication the fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial except as follows 1 where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility 2 where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime mistake of fact unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime mistake of law ignorance of the provision of this part is not a defense to any criminal prosecution however mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances 1 where the offender reasonably relied on an act of this municipality in repealing an existing criminal provision or in otherwise purporting to make the offenders conduct lawful  or 2 where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional justification  general provisions the fact that an offenders conduct is justifiable although otherwise criminal shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct this defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances 1 when the offenders conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office  2 when the offenders conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful under the laws of the state of louisiana or of this chapter  3 when for any reason the offenders conduct is authorized by law  4 when the offenders conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents tutors or teachers  5 when the crime consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility  6 when any crime is committed compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not committed  or 7

force or violence upon the person of another is justifiable when committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a persons lawful possession  provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent the offense and that this provision shall not apply where the force or violence results in a homicide aggressor cannot claim self defense a person who is the aggressor or who brings on a difficulty cannot claim the right of selfdefense unless he withdraws from the conflict in good faith in a manner that his adversary knows or should know that he desires to withdraw and discontinue the conflict defense of others it is justifiable to use force or violence in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used those means himself and when it is reasonably believed that the intervention is necessary

its commission or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime are principals attempt a any person who having a specific intent to commit a crime does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended  and it shall be immaterial whether under the circumstances he would have actually accomplished his purpose b mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt  but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended c an attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended crime  and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime although it appears on the trial that the crime intended or attempted was actually perpetrated by

governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1 111510 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure
