the sewer service charge relative to changing system operation maintenance and debt service costs 5216 sec 5255 sewer use rates history ordinances 1986 repealed series of 1995 sec 5256 interceptor area benefit connection charge a introduction it is the general public policy of the village that new users within the village shall reasonably participate in the cost of existing interceptor facilities at the time their lands actually receive sanitary sewer service interceptor facilities are generally defined as all interceptors and related facilities such as manholes and appurtenances pumping stations and force mains in determining what constitutes reasonable participation toward such cost the village shall be guided by the principle that the area to be served shall bear its proportionate share of such costs the cost of interceptor facilities in which new users are required to participate are i cost reasonably and necessary incurred to construct the sewage facilities to serve the new areas  and ii the cost of providing excess capacity in the intercepting sewers until such time as the future users in the new areas connect to the sanitary sewer system intercepting sewers have an anticipated physical life of in excess of 50 years this requires that they be constructed of sufficient capacity to serve present users and future users the capacity required to serve future users is referred to as excess capacity it is more economical to construct interceptors with excess capacity as opposed to the construction of parallel sewers particularly because such interceptors are initially constructed in largely undeveloped lands it is reasonable that future users as well as present users pay the total cost of the interceptor systems that serve them it would be unfair and unreasonable for a future user to pay only the cost incurred at the time of the initial construction and not pay costs associated with providing the excess capacity the investment in excess capacity is made for the future users benefit  and is not available for other uses by the village since future users make no payment until they connect to the sanitary sewer system only a part of the total cost of the interceptors can be collected when first placed in service the cost to be recovered at the time of initial construction should be recovered interceptor area benefit connection charge against the new areas served b computation of interceptor area benefit connection charge the cost of constructing sanitary interceptors varies with location because of varying labor and material costs and general economic conditions because each intercepting sewer has its unique service area the cost to serve any particular property varies according to the propertys location relative to the interceptor and the area that can be served by the interceptor to reflect these factors the interceptor area benefit connection charge the charge shall be computed in the following manner 1 the potential ultimate service area of the new interceptor shall be determined primarily use of land use projections with strong reliance on adopted land use plans of any governmental authority have appropriate jurisdiction thereof and consistent with the regulations for staging of interceptors as provided for in nr 110 wis admin potential ultimate service area shall exclude wetlands or lands excluded by duly adopted regional plans or land use plans 2 the capital cost of constructing the interceptor shall be determined when a new interceptor connects to an existing interceptor a proportionate share of the current replacement cost of the existing interceptor facility based upon stated use shall be included as a capital cost of the new interceptor 5217 3 the total capital costs of constructing the new interceptor shall be divided by the potential ultimate service area of the interceptor to arrive at a cost per thousand square feet of area served this rate shall be the initial charge 4 the initial rate comprising the charge shall be adjusted annually to recover costs associated with providing excess capacity and to reflect the benefit conferred upon and received by the new user the amount of the annual adjustment is such that the new user will pay an amount that would build an equivalent sewer at the time the new user connects to the system  and the village will recover cost equivalent to its initial investment c annual adjustment to interceptor area benefit connection charge the charge shall be annually adjusted based upon the engineering news record construction cost index the index which index most closely reflects construction costs the factors used in determining construction costs include labor costs involved in constructing interceptors such as common labor cement finisher carpenter and medium equipment operator plus fringe benefits they also include construction materials such as 3000 psi ready mixed concrete 24inch reinforced concrete pipe 2 x 10 s4s lowest grade lumber and paving asphalt the base index is 100 for the year 1913 each interceptor shall be assigned a base index equal to the index at the time of construction of the interceptor that base index is used in conjunction with the most current index to adjust the initial charge the following example is provided by way of explanation a final plat is approved by the village board which plat contains a total area of 100 gross acres the plat contains 150 lots averaging 05 acres in size  streets and outlots constitute 15 acres  an environmental corridor and wetlands constitute 3 acres  and a neighborhood park constitutes 5 acres the charge will be assessed on 97 acres of the final plat excludes the environmental corridorwetlands area the charge will be collected upon approval of the final plat assume the charge was $1398 per 1000 square feet upon adoption of this as listed under sect 5256d the index at the time of adoption of this  if the current index is 722 then the current charge is $1459 per 1000square feet therefore the total charge for this 100acre development is $6164742 d establishment of interceptor area benefit connection charges the following charges are established for the year 2004 in the following amounts and for the following described interceptors  and such charges shall be adjusted each calendar year thereafter as provided for herein by means of a resolution duly adopted by the village board prior to december 31 of the year preceding the calendar year for which the adjustment is made interceptor iabc charges 1 west side interceptor $13981000 sq feet as of 32004 2 13th street interceptor $13981000 sq feet as of 32004 3 water street interceptor $13981000 sq feet as of 32004 e application of interceptor area benefit connection charge in collecting the charges the following shall apply 5218 1 the charge is imposed upon all lands including municipally owned lands park lands conservancy lands lands designated as permanent open space as well as any other undeveloped areas  and the only lands to be excluded there from are wetlands and lands permanently declared as undevelopable by duly adopted plans of governmental authorities having appropriate jurisdiction thereof 2 the charge shall be computed on a net area basis for plats and certified surveys excluding public roads 3 in any case not covered by the policy statements contained in this the village board shall determine whether or not the charge shall be imposed as well as the amount thereof f use of interceptor area benefit connection charge the charges collected pursuant to this shall be deposited into the villages sewerage capital funds project account and used primarily to pay for the cost of cost of construction of additional sewerage facilities to serve all users or for debt service thereon g payment the charge shall be paid to the city clerk upon the earlier of the following events i issuance of a permit for the connection of a building sewer to a public sewer owned by the village which public sewer conveys wastewater to the interceptor in question  or ii the date of approval by the village board of the final plat or the certified survey map of a subdivision of a lot parcel or tract of land which lot parcel or tract is or will be served by the interceptor in question  and in this latter event no later than the date of actual recording of the final plat or certified survey map at the register of deeds office a penalty of 1% per month shall be assessed on all such charges not paid at that time  and such penalty shall continue until payment is made in full history ordinances 1986 created series of 2004 history ordinances 1986 amended series of 2005 sec 5257 through sec 5259 reserved for future use 5219 article e

property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist iii health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and iv the potential infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct  and 8 the village board desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the village of prairie du sac  protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight  and 14 9 the village board has determined that enactment of an ordinance prohibiting live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve
