numbering system used in this subpart b is the same system used in many state and local government codes each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash the figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter thus the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 12 and the first section of chapter 6 is 61 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 61 and 62 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 615 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division new chapters may be included in the same manner if the new material is to be included between chapters 63 and 64 it will be designated as chapter 635 care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters page numbering system the page numbering system used in this a prefix system the letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume the number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that
