second section of chapter 1 is numbered 12 and the first section of chapter 6 is 61 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 61 and 62 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 615 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of

here the first merchant not associated with the indian fur trade south bends industrial growth was slow coquillards flour mill was the primary attempt to use water power but water power did not come into its own until a dam and races were built along the river during the 1840s and 1850s four major manufacturing firms began business almond bugbee and alexis roote formed a firm to manufacture boots and shoes eliakim briggs invented a traveling threshing machine it was not until the 1850s when the studebaker brothers 1852 and the olivers 1855 ushered in the areas industrial era at the same time

university of south bend are products of the 20th century today south bend is a diversified city  politically industrially socially and culturally with a population of 107789 incorporation of south bend the original plat of the town was recorded  and it was made the permanent county seat of the st joseph county on  not until four years later however were proceedings commenced to incorporate on  the county commissioners ordered that an election be held on  for the purpose of electing trustees for the incorporation of the town of south bend this order was granted on petition of twothirds of the citizens of the proposed town the town government functioned for about two years but the money panic of 1837 hit the community so hard that the town languished and the town government ceased to function a few years later after the growth of the community had resumed it was felt desirable to revive the government but there was considerable doubt as to whether the original corporation still existed to cure this problem the state legislature was petitioned for a special charter and on  the town was reincorporated by special act of the state legislature this town government continued to function until the town became a city in 1865 the successive presidents of the town board of trustees were the following horatio chapin 18351836  edmund pitts taylor 1837  john brownfield 18451847

signed by john h keedy and 285 others was filed with the town trustees seeking an election on the question of incorporation as a city such an election was held on  and those favoring the change of the form of government from town to city prevailed the first election of city officers took place on  following incorporation in 1865 the city was first laid out in three wards but in 1867 the town of lowell on the east side of the st joseph river opposite south bend was annexed to the city and became the fourth ward an ordinance authorizing the establishment of a municipal waterworks was adopted on  following these two bond issues totaling $16500000 were sold and the system went into operation late in that year in 1901 the indiana general assembly passed an act dealing with the incorporation of cities which applied to a population bracket which apparently included only south bend this then in effect became a special charter for the city of south bend and caused the structure of the city government to be set up for the first time in the basic form it has held ever since this south bend charter of the acts of 190 approved  and containing an emergency clause contained most of the provisions later incorporated in the cities and towns of the acts of 1905 which supplanted it the following have held the office of mayor since the incorporation of the city of south bend william g

issues are of paramount importance affecting not only the physical wellbeing and safety of the citys residents but are vital to revitalizing the central business district the older commercial strips and our residential neighborhoods which must be recognized as being safe secure and civil public spaces 2 persons who engage in unlawful conduct in public places harass and unduly interfere with the lawful use and enjoyment of such public places thereby constituting a danger to the public health and safety 3 it is appropriate for the protection of the public safety and welfare to enact reasonable regulations to ensure that public safety is not jeopardized by acts of loitering when they are committed for the purpose of intimidation coercion harassment menacing or assaultive conduct in violation of applicable law 4 loitering in public places by criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area resulting from the high rates of drugdealing shootings and vandalism often associated with such activities which intimidate lawabiding citizens diminishes the value of nearby property and has the potential to destabilize communities and attract further violence 5 the existence of such gang loitering is often accompanied by secondary effects that are detrimental to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of south bend indiana such secondary effects include significant criminal activity and activities injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the community detrimental effects on nearby businesses and residential areas and a decline in property values 6 current ordinances are inadequate to deal with the problems posed by gang loitering and loitering as a means to facilitate trafficking in narcotics and controlled substances since many depend upon the willingness of civilians to testify against gang members and drug dealers with civilians being reluctant to put themselves in harms way by providing such testimony 7 this article is further intended to detect and discourage the involvement of gang activities to prevent the exploitation of minors to effectively deploy the citys limited law enforcement resources to protect the public health safety morals and general welfare and to assist law enforcement in the enforcement of loitering regulations when associated with the violation of controlled substance and alcoholic beverage laws assaults and breaches of the peace which negatively impact the quality of life in the neighborhoods where it is

the type a open landscaping creates a pleasant visual experience but provides a minimal visual or sound barrier therefore type a open landscaping is intended for use on lots where the district of the abutting lots includes permitted uses with similar intensities lights sounds and regular operations and would have minimal if any negative impact on adjacent properties type a open landscaping requires a majority of the landscape materials to be of a shade tree variety with flexibility to add color interest or heavier visual screening if desired b type b partial screening  the type b partial screening landscaping creates a partial visual and sound barrier and is intended for use on lots where the district of the abutting lots includes permitted uses that may be similar in land use intensity but may still contain lights sounds and regular operations which may adversely impact adjacent properties type b partial screening landscaping requires the use of evergreen trees to provide yearround buffering while allowing flexibility to add color and interest with deciduous trees or shrubshedge plants c type c full screening  the type c full screening landscaping shall be designed to create a substantial visual barrier from grade to at least six 6 feet above grade at time of planting type c full screening landscaping should also provide a sound barrier effect type c full screening landscaping is intended to be placed on lots in higher intensity districts which abut lots located in lesser intense districts that may be adversely impacted by the lights sounds and regular operations of the higher intensity district  type c full screening landscaping requires significant use of evergreen trees to provide yearround buffering while allowing flexibility to add color and

disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and f make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city of south bend indiana by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program 4 objectives the objectives of this article are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
