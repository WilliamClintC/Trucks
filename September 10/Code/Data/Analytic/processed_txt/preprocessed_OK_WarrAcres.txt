new chapter 819 in title 8 of the warr acres municipal code to enact a set of temporary ordinances to be known as the warr acres covid19 safety code to be codified as sections  through   providing for severability and declaring an emergency emergency ordinance be it ordained by the council of the city of warr acres oklahoma that a new be adopted in title 8 of the warr acres municipal read as follows chapter 819 covid19 safety code  title  findings  definitions  face coverings required  guidelines for face coverings  exceptions  duration of temporary requirements  enforcement  violations  penalties  affirmative defense  title this entitled and shall be known as the warr acres covid19 safety findings the united states is experiencing an outbreak of novel coronavirus2019 also known as covid19  and on  the world health organization characterized the covid19 outbreak as a pandemic  and on  the president of the united states declared a national emergency because of the covid19 pandemic and which declaration is still in effect today  and on  the governor of the state of oklahoma declared a state of emergency because of the covid19 pandemic and which declaration is still in effect today  and the center for disease control cdc has emphasized the covid19 risk to individuals is dependent on exposure and transmission is droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes  and as of  there have been 451 reported covid19 related deaths statewide with 77 deaths in the oklahoma county area  and the city council of the city of warr acres city finds that the center for disease control cdc has identified a virus covid19 which is causing a pandemic throughout the world and the united states remains present extremely contagious and potentially deadly within the city and the metropolitan area  and after reaching a low point for positive tests and hospitalizations in june oklahoma city experienced a significant increase in the number of covid19 positive tests and hospitalizations  and after a period where the rise in new cases subsided the increase in new cases and positive testing percentages has resumed this past week and remains at an elevated level relative to previous phases of the pandemic  and since midjune hospitalizations have consistently remained at an elevated level that causes concern to public health officials  and based upon information provided by local healthcare providers and public health experts during consideration of a similar ordinance by the city of oklahoma city the current surge occurred in part due to public gatherings associated with the fourth of july holiday where social distancing and mask wearing protocols were not observed  and one strong recommendation by the cdc is the adoption of the safety measure for the mandatory wearing of face coverings over the nose and mouth to help prevent airborn virus particles from causing new infections and depending on the design of the mask can also help prevent the persons wearing the face covering to not become infected with covid19  and with the transmission of covid19 and covidrelated hospitalizations continuing at an elevated level provisions for the safety of the life health and property of warr acres residents are still necessary  and the city council declares that the continuing occurrence and threat of widespread or severe damage injury or loss of life or property from covid19 including severe economic damage to the city and the state of oklahoma which can result from covid19 justifies emergency action by the city to help avert such danger or damage and to protect the public health  and the city council further declares an emergency need for an ordinance containing the covid19 safety measure for the mandatory wearing of face coverings over the nose and mouth whenever persons are in any place or setting open to the general public  and the city council notes that on friday  dallas federal reserve bank president robert kaplan publicly stated that the key to ensuring a faster us economic recovery is wearing masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus  and how the covid19 virus proceeds and what the incidence is is going to be directly related to how fast we grow economically  and while monetary and fiscal policy have a key role to play the primary economic policy from here is broad mask wearing and good execution of  health care protocols  if we do that well well grow faster  and the message id have today about the economy is that while monetary policy and fiscal policy are very important they are not as important right now in us doing a good job of flattening this curve on the virus and if we do that well grow faster  and the city council further notes that the recent surge in covid19 cases in several us states is raising concern that the economic recovery that likely began in may could falter if authorities reimpose lockdowns or consumers reduce spending out of fear that getting out and about could mean they get the sometimes fatal disease  and the city council further notes that goldman sachs group inc economists have argued that a national mask mandate would boost the chances of a faster recovery  and that mr kaplan a former goldman sachs bank officer reiterated that the us economy will likely shrink by 45% to 5% in 202 even after what he expects to be growth during the 3 rd and 4 th quarters  and the city council finds that it is appropriate and in the interests of the public health safety and welfare and would further protect property and civil order for the city council to adopt this covid19 safety a regulation mandating the wearing of masks over the nose and mouth whenever persons are entering and while inside any indoor place open to the public  and the city council states that this covid19 safety is being enacted to help limit the health impacts and slow the spread of covid19 by mandating the wearing of face coverings over the nose and mouth whenever persons are entering and while inside any indoor place open to the public  and the city council finds that adoption of the temporary restrictions contained in this now until the period until immediately after labor day on  will allow local healthcare providers and public health experts to gather empirical evidence regarding the effects of this mask policy and may help to prevent the potential for an additional surge associated with the labor day holiday weekend  and the city council finds that the city of oklahoma city which shares the majority of the citys jurisdictional border adopted a substantially similar ordinance on   and the city council finds that it is in the interests of both those who reside andor visit the city to have as consistent and uniform set of temporary restrictions so as to avoid any confusion as to the expectations that are in place for those visiting indoor places open to the public within the oklahoma county metropolitan area  and accordingly the city council also finds that it is appropriate and in the interests of public health safety and welfare and would further protect property and civil order for the city council to adopt this ordinance while limiting the duration of this ordinance to and until the day after labor day provided for the ages this requirement applies to the city council has determined that ages 11 and up is appropriate but the public should keep in mind that the cdc recommends that persons 3 and up should wear masks  definitions the term face covering as used in this article shall mean a uniform piece of material that securely covers a persons nose and mouth and remains affixed in place without the use of ones hands andor a face shield  face coverings required all persons shall wear face coverings when entering and while inside any indoor place open to the public  guidelines for face coverings the public is encouraged to wear face coverings that  afit snugly but comfortably against the side of the

drainage system as established becomes a permanent feature of the community so that mistakes may cause considerable financial loss to the developer and continued excessive maintenance expense to the city bit is the intent of this chapter to establish standards based on sound engineering principles which will provide for an efficient storm drainage system to the end that the development of land may proceed in an orderly manner and excessive city maintenance expense may be avoided   modification of provisions modifications of any of the provisions of the regulations provided by this chapter when required by unusual circumstances will not be made without written permission of the city engineer   drainage channel classifications for the purpose of the regulations provided in this chapter drainage channels shall be classified as follows aprimary drainage channels shall be those streams creeks and channels which drain an area of five hundred 500 acres or more bsecondary drainage channels shall be all drainage channels which drain an area less than five hundred 500 acres   calculating stream flow and runoff the maximum condition of rainfall for a 50year frequency shall be used for the purpose of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and structures unless otherwise specified in this chapter the following formulas and value shall be used for calculating all stream flow and runoff for the policies and regulations established in this chapter arunoff from drainage areas of nine hundred 900 acres or less shall be determined by the rational formula q   air where q  flow in cubic feet per second a  area to be drained in acres determined by field surveys for areas less than one hundred 100 acres and by the latest government quadrangle maps for larger
