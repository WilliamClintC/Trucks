hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations art 1  a 8182004   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of springfield are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the lax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which arc inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages art 1  b 8182004   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to life health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art 1  c 8182004   objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life health and to eliminate or minimize property damage  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines roadways and bridges and culverts located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area art 1  e 8182004   reserved editors note adopted  repealed  3035 which pertained to methods of reducing flood losses and derived from
