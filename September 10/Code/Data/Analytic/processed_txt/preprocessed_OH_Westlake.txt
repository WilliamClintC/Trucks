fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its

anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities

subsections b1 5 hereof raise substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those

businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety

businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 13 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business or adult motel 14 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a

forth in  is required of new developments within the city of westlake to prevent the resultant increased storm runoff caused by the development from aggravating flooding conditions along the drainage streams in the watershed for this reason the duration of the design storm used to calculate allowable discharge rates from all onsite retarding basins is the concentration time of the main stream of the watershed on which the site to be developed is located for convenience in calculations the concentration times of all main streams in the city of westlake is considered to be two hours by ordinance allowable discharge from developed sites or onsite retarding basins is limited to two thirds of the runoff from the land in its present state of development hence the maximum discharge rate for any onsite retarding basin is found by multiplying together the factor twothirds  the runoff coefficient for current land use  the tributary area in acres  and the rainfall intensity for a tenyear twohour duration storm  ie q10 23 x c x a x 102hr q10 in cfs the allowable discharge rate of undeveloped land after development is therefore limited to  cfs per acre volume of storage required in order to calculate the volume of storage required to achieve the allowable discharge rate the total volume of runoff for tenyear storms of various durations has to be calculated to determine the maximum volume of storage the retarding basin must hold for each storm duration the total volume of runoff from this storm is calculated and from this volume is deducted the amount of water discharged from the retarding basin while the storm inflow into the retarding basin exceeds the maximum allowable discharge rate the maximum remainder is the total volume of storage required for this particular retarding basin tenyear rainfall intensityduration table the following rainfall intensityduration table is to be used for the calculation of tenyear inflow hydrographs to determine the maximum storage

considered for use in the city of westlake one discharge control type offstream retarding basins permits all inflows less than the maximum discharge rate to pass downstream without storage all inflows in excess of this maximum discharge rate are then diverted to storage in the retarding basin for release after the passage of the storm discharge under the other type of control onstream retarding basins is dependent upon retarding basin storage depth and discharge only reaches the maximum rate at the maximum retarding basin storage depth this type of retarding basin therefore reaches its maximum storage depth when falling inflow rate drops down to equal maximum discharge rate the onstream retarding basintype of control is the one most generally used the shape of the discharge rate curve for this type of control is generally an ogee curve but for simplicity in analysis can be assumed to be a straight line from the origin of rainfall to its point of intersection with the inflow hydrograph at the maximum discharge rate the effect of these two types of control systems is illustrated by the hydrographs on the next page   images0003223jpg hydrograph onstream retarding basin

122115   112701 intent and application  incorporation of plans for public areas the planning principles established in this chapter are intended to be fundamental principles to be applied with professional skill in the planning of land so as to produce attractive and harmonious neighborhoods convenient and safe streets and economical layouts of residential business and industrial development it may not be possible to incorporate all these principles in each subdivision especially small developments however the planning commission shall determine if certain principles are not applicable if a comprehensive guide plan thoroughfare plan or plan for parks and other open areas has been adopted streets school sites public parks and all other land uses shown on the guide plan thoroughfare plan or plan for parks and other open areas shall be incorporated in the subdivision plans passed 71664 112702 topography subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage facilities to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil the natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan topographic maps shall be utilized in the land planning astreets land which is relatively flat or of very gentle slopes shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage courses and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade on irregular topography streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills and so that lots on one side of the street will not be excessively above or below the street grade bnatural drainage subdivisions shall be designed to take advantage of natural grades so that all the land can be drained without excessive grading unless watercourses or drainage ways are enclosed lots shall be arranged so that rear lot lines will be approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course and only where such a plan is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course drainage easements may be included as part of a lot but shall not be used as a building site or included in calculating the required lot area or widths the area of storm sewer easements shall not be deducted from the lot area or width requirements the director of engineering may however require that the storm sewer easement be deducted when the depth or size of the storm sewer is of such extent that it requires greater clearance between structures for maintenance purposes the area of swale easements shall not be deducted from lot area or width requirements cnatural features natural features changes in level brooks lakes hilltops and other focal points within the site and distant view outside the subdivision shall be integrated in the design to obtain natural variations and interest in each neighborhood and to create attractive building sites

traffic generation and unless shown otherwise on the thoroughfare plan shall be planned for continuation of existing streets in the system at the same width or greater width in accordance with adopted city standards major streets shall contain as few intersections as possible where a subdivision of onefamily dwellings adjoins a major street the planning commission may require the developer to prepare sketches and estimates of a plan based on marginal access streets or such other treatment as the fronting of lots on perpendicular local streets in order to protect the residential property from the movement of heavy traffic and to eliminate driveways cutting into a major street and it may require a plan wherein lots do not have direct access onto the major street or require a setback of such depth that marginal streets can be constructed in the future bsecondary streets secondary streets function for the collection of traffic from local streets and for the distribution of traffic onto major streets they normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with local streets and a few with major streets unless shown otherwise on the thoroughfare plan a secondary street system may be required wherever a residential neighborhood surrounded by major streets is designed to serve over 500 dwelling units clocal streets local streets function to provide direct and full

illuminating engineering society ies in particular illumination levels uniformity ratios and reflectance and glare control shall be appropriate for the use and location 3 when there is a conflict between this section and other portions of the then the more stringent requirement shall govern other applicable code elements include but are not limited to electrical life safety building urban forestry environmental and zoning codes 4 this section shall not be used to circumvent any safety health or environmental requirements d definitions 1 absolute lumen output refer to lumen below 2 bug rating an exterior luminaire classification system that identifies relative levels of b backlight u uplight and g glare emitted by a luminaire bug rating classifications are defined by the illuminating engineering society 3 candelaa unit of luminous intensity of a lighting source emitted in a given direction 4 color rendering index cria consensus method for determining how well a luminaire light sources spectral range aligns with that of a reference source using an eightcolor sample and a weighted numeric scale of up to 100 perfect rendering as with sunlight 5 color temperature ct the measured comparison of a light sources chromaticity with that of an ideal blackbody radiator measured in degrees kelvin k the color temperature of a source is an indicator of the color of the source when directly viewed by an observer ct should not be confused wth cri as these are not directly related ct is used particularly with incandescent and halogen light sources 6 correlated color temperature cct the measured color temperature of a light source that is not a fullspectrum emitter therefore does not fall directly on the ideal blackbody locus cct represents the nearest visual match of a source to the blackbody locus cct is used particularly with solid state led fluorescent and discharge light sources 7 cutoff or full cutoff refer to shielding 8curfewa time each night after which certain artificial illumination must be reduced in intensity or turned off 9 energy the code adopted statewide for the regulation of building envelopes and energyconsuming systems used in the built environment intended to minimize energy consumption while maintaining appropriate and comfortable environs this code addresses artificial lighting energy consumption and control requirements that must be met as of january 201 the codes in effect are aresidential energy international energy conservation some state amendments bcommercial energy international energy conservation or ash rae standard 901201 with amendments 10facade the exterior walls of a building or structure 11footcandle the unit of measure expressing the quantity of light incident to a surface one footcandle is the illuminance produced by a reference candle on a surface of one square foot located one foot from the candle a footcandle is equal to one 1 lumen distributed over a square foot of area 12glare  the sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted causing annoyance discomfort or loss of vision or visual performance 13hardscape lighting any luminaires associated with site features such as sculptures fountains pocket plazas and similar elements 14landscape lighting any luminaires mounted ingrade or within 3 feet above the finished grade and used solely for accent illumination of landscaping paths and associated site spaces 15light pollution the added sky brightness caused by the scattering of electric light into the atmosphere also referred to as sky glow 16light trespass the effect caused by light that strays from the intended purpose and becomes an annoyance a nuisance results in loss of privacy or is detrimental to visual acuity light trespass is always a negative condition for the purposes of this light trespass includes any light that radiates or falls beyond the property line bounding the property upon which the source is installed 17lighting zone a classification of an area defined by varying levels of acceptable ambient light population density usage and other considerations each planning or use zone within the city is assigned to a lighting zone zones are classified within this section and are based upon the mlo 18lumen the unit of measure for luminous flux visible light emitted by a light source absolute lumen output or luminaire lumen output refers to the light emitted from a lighting system after losses within the lumina ire are subtracted for example a 15000 lumen lamp installed within a luminaire having 80% net efficiency in optics power supply and enclosure will have an absolute lumen output of 12000 lumens 19luminaire a complete lighting unit consisting of light sources optical and emission control components mounting andor positioning components interface components between light source and the power supply and the enclosure or housing of the source and associated components 20luminance the quantity of light emitted or reflected towards an observer ie what is seen by an observer 21nadir the angle pointing straight down plumb from the center of a light source measurement of light emission from a source is measured in angular degrees from nadir 22photometry the measurement of quantities associated with visible light visual photometry occurs when the human eye compares relative brightness physical photometry occurs when physical receptors are used to measure brightness photometric calculations are performed using software that can model physically measured photometric data to estimate illumination of surfaces from various source types locations and orientation 23shielding a means for controlling the distribution of light from a luminaire for exterior lighting shielding results in a lumina ire being classified under one of the following levels of spill control afull cutoff luminaire emits no light above the horizontal plane aligned with the top of luminaire bcutoff luminaire emits no more than two 2 percent of its total light output above the horizontal plane aligned with the top of luminaire 24spill light any emitted or reflected artificial light that radiates or falls beyond the targeted illumination area 25temporary lighting refers to any luminaires or light

to ensure that these objectives are achieved impartial review process which assures that each proposal complies with these design guidelines passed 11702 123702 explanation of terms for the purpose of and use in this certain terms and words shall be interpreted with regard to the following explanations a appropriateness a proposal is judged to be appropriate when it respects the existing architectural style of a building and fits comfortably within its setting neighborhood and overall community this condition applies to landscaping and accessory structures as well b compatibility a design or a materialcolor selection is compatible when it does not strongly deviate from its parent building or the overall character of the neighborhood to be compatible does not require look alike designs but rather designs that reflect some aspects of its parent building or buildings in the general vicinity such as scale of windows overhangs building materials patterns of siding roof slope conversely incompatibility occurs when an architectural design landscape design or accessory building proposal is aesthetically harsh or overwhelming relative to its neighbors c noncontributing a factor in a proposal or part thereof that is taken from an existing building characteristic or site feature such as design scale fenestration architectural feature material or color that is determined by the planning commission to be not appropriate for replication in new projects or modifications to existing projects when 1 it does not enhance or improve the character of the city andor the surrounding environs of the project or 2 it is unrepresentative of the overall character of the city andor the prevalent character of the surrounding environs of the project d proportion the relationship of parts of a building landscape structures or buildings to each other and to the whole balance e proximity proximity shall be considered in terms of the potential for one property by virtue of its locations to materially affect other properties in determining a property to be in proximity to another the following factors shall be considered  1the visibility of both properties from a common point  or 2 the location of both properties within a relatively compact network of streets walkways or spaces f style style relates to a buildings character and configuration in plan and elevation it also relates to architectural conventions of a particular time period concerning details of windows and doors eaves corner boards pitch of roofs and the materials of the buildings skin
