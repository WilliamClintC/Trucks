that the indexing and maintenance of an index of all public records obtained by the city would be unduly burdensome and would interfere with the operations of the city a current index as described in rcw  will therefore not be maintained by the city the city clerk shall continue to make available for public inspection and copying all existing indices maintained for use by the city of poulsbo   exemptions the city hereby adopts by reference those exemptions from public inspection and copying described in rcw as the same may be amended from time to time in addition the city adopts as its current list containing every law other than those listed in the public records act that it believes exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records required under rcw 2 those exemptions set forth in appendix c of public records act for washington cities counties and special purpose districts by the municipal research and services center in september 201 as may be amended

the record 2 provide an internet address and link on the citys website to the specific records requested except that if the requestor notifies the city that he or she cannot access the records internet then the city must provide copies of the record or allow the requestor to view copies using a city computer 3 acknowledge receipt of the request and provide a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request 4 if the request is unclear acknowledge the request and ask the requestor to clarify the request and provide to the greatest extent possible a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request if it is not clarified or 5 deny the request additional time to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request to locate and assemble the information requested to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt if the requestor fails to clarify a request when asked the city must respond to the parts of the request that are clear if the entire request is unclear and the requestor fails to respond to a request for clarification the city need not respond to it bpublic records may be provided on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for public disclosure if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request cpursuant to rcw  and  the city may impose a reasonable charge for providing copies and for the use of city equipment which charges shall not exceed the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its actual costs incident to such copying the city clerk may establish a cost schedule for such charges under pmc c the city finds that it would be unduly burdensome to calculate the cost of producing standard black and white paper copies of records  scanning paper records into an electronic format  attaching files for electronic delivery  and transmitting data electronically because such calculation would require the city to parse numerous cost factors including staff time depreciation value of copying equipment ink paper electricity and data storage and transmission services though each of these factors imposes a cost on the city the individual contribution of each copy to the total costs is so small that attempting to calculate the exact cost of each service may lead to error the city therefore authorizes the city clerk to impose the default costs for these services in rcw 2b for all other costs associated with producing copies of public records the city clerk shall establish the actual costs of the service the city may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request if public records are made available on a partial or installment basis the applicable fees shall be due and payable for each part of the request as it is provided dno fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records copies of records can be reviewed at city hall ethe city shall not distinguish among persons requesting records and such persons shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose of the request except to establish whether inspection or copying would violate the prohibition on providing a list of individuals for commercial purposes or any other statute or ordinance which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records based on the purpose of the request or the intended use of records   denialsprocedure for review of decision aif the city clerk determines that a document is exempt in part but can be made available after deletion of exempt portions the request shall be granted  provided that such exempt portions shall first be deleted if the city clerk determines to deny the request in whole or in part

writing including email to the city clerk for a review of that decision the petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or designee

of the city of poulsbo and its officials granted by any other ordinance statutory provision or other law the city of poulsbo and its officials retain the authority to apply any design or construction standards not adopted by the city engineer if otherwise authorized to do so     conduit standards alegislative findings the poulsbo city council finds that 1demand for access to highspeed telecommunications services is growing in order to fill such demand telecommunications service providers install telecommunication lines in public rightsofway 2in other jurisdictions the demand for access and the number of telecommunications service providers has sometimes resulted in multiple serial excavations within the public rightsofway each such excavation can and does result in traffic disruption a weakening of pavement integrity and a shortening of the useful life of paved surfaces 3the city of poulsbo has not experienced a high demand for use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications service providers but in order to responsibly manage its public rightsofway the city should anticipate such demand in the future and plan accordingly 4requiring that conduit be installed in newly constructed public streets and rightsofway in order to accommodate the anticipated future demand for access to telecommunications services will assist the city in responsibly managing its public rightsofway by areducing or eliminating the need for excavation within public streets and rightsofway when telecommunications service providers seek to locate underground telecommunications facilities within such streets and rightsofway in the future  breduce or eliminate the traffic disruption that occurs whenever excavation occurs within streets and public rightsofway  creduce or eliminate the loss of pavement integrity and diminishment of the useful life of pavement that occurs whenever paved streets and rightsofway are cut and excavated within  and dmeet the needs and desires of the public for access to highspeed telecommunications services and the needs and desires of telecommunications service providers to locate within the public streets and rightsofway 5in residential areas anticipated demand for the reasonable future can likely be met by the capacity provided by two telecommunication lines in nonresidential areas anticipated demand is higher but can likely be met for the reasonable future by the capacity provided by four telecommunication lines requiring the installation of conduit and other facilities necessary to support these lines will allow anticipated needs to be met while allowing the city to responsibly manage its rightsofway bintent the intent of this section is to provide for the construction of infrastructure sufficient to allow telecommunications service providers desiring to deploy communication lines in the future to do so by pulling the same conduit and appurtenances installed pursuant to this section and without excavating within the rightofway this section is not intended to require telecommunications service providers to install additional ducts or conduit pursuant the provisions of rcw  but is intended to require those constructing public streets including the city and private developers to provide and install such conduit and appurtenances as may be necessary to accommodate future telecommunications needs within public streets and rightsofway without further excavation or disturbance crequirementsadoption of standards whenever any new public street is constructed whether by the city as a public works project or by a private party in conjunction with development the following shall be required 1in all new local access public streets serving or abutting residential development

telecommunication lines within the conduit 4all construction and installation shall be accomplished according to construction standards adopted by the city engineer the construction standards shall be adopted with due consideration given to existing and anticipated technologies and industry standards the construction standards shall specify the minimum diameter of the conduit and interducts and the minimum number of interducts to meet the requirements of this section 5all conduit and appurtenances installed by private parties pursuant to this section shall be conveyed and dedicated to the city with the dedication and conveyance of the public street andor rightofway 6any and all installation costs shall be the responsibility of the party constructing the public street duse by telecommunications service providers whenever conduit installed or to be installed under this section is available or will become available within a newly constructed public streets or rightofway upon dedication all telecommunications service providers thereafter locating telecommunication lines within such street or rightofway shall be required to locate their communication lines within such conduit unless it can be demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the city engineer that such location is not technologically feasible or reasonably practicable conduit capacity shall be allocated to telecommunications service providers on a firstcome firstserved basis  provided that the city may reserve capacity within such conduits for its own use  and provided further that the city engineer may adopt additional rules for conduit allocation in order to ensure that all telecommunications service providers have reasonable access to the citys rightsofway and that no barriers to entry or competition result from the allocation of conduit space efees the city reserves the right to charge reasonable fees for the use of conduit installed pursuant to this section to the extent consistent with and as limited by federal and state laws and regulations any such fees shall be established by resolution or ordinance   compliance all new construction or reconstruction shall comply

listed in order of preference are defined as follows arestoration the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland for the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres restoration is divided into ireestablishment the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions iirehabilitation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres bcreationestablishment the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics present to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site where a wetland did not previously exist activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod create hydric soils and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species establishment results in a gain in wetland acres cenhancement the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten intensify or improve specific functions or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement floodwater retention or wildlife habitat activities typically consist of planting vegetation controlling nonnative or noxious weeds class a and b modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods or some combination of these enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions but does not result in a gain in wetland acres dpreservation the removal of a threat to or preventing the decline of wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland this term includes the purchase of land

greater than the wetland being impacted  or iiithe proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and are shown to be successful ccompensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland an atypical wetland is defined as a wetland whose design does not match the type of wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the proposed site ie the water sources and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting any designs that provide exaggerated morphology such as excavating a permanently inundated pond in a seasonally saturated or inundated wetland or require a berm or engineered structures to hold back water would be considered atypical ecompensatory mitigation unless it

insubdrainagebasin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts  and 2offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland  and 3offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless aestablished watershed goals for water
