eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number

evidence that the continued vitality of the city depends on the preservation of safe healthy and attractive neighborhoods the council further finds that the flight of residents and property owners from the core area of cities can be traced in part to the deterioration of such cities as attractive and comfortable places in which to reside the council further finds that one fact that has contributed to this deterioration in the city is the excessive and burdensome practice of an over abundance of residents and nonresidents in certain areas and neighborhoods parking their motor vehicles for extended periods of time therein since there is in the city at any time a large surplus of motor vehicles over available on and offstreet parking spaces this condition detracts from a healthy and complete urban environment a system of preferential resident parking will serve to reduce a number of strains on residents of the city and thus promote the general public welfare bspecific findings the following specific legislative findings of the council in support of preferential resident parking are set forth as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this are intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual basis supporting its adoption 1 the safety health and welfare of the residents of the city can be greatly enhanced by the maintenance of the attractiveness convenience and livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas  2 it is a fact of modern living in the city that a large portion of municipal residents possess automobiles and as a result are daily faced with the need to store these motor vehicles in or near their residences  3 certain neighborhoods and areas of the city do not have sufficient on or offstreet space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles by residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes  4 such neighborhoods above are often further burdened by influxes of motor vehicles owned by nonresidents which compete for the inadequate availability of onstreet parking spaces  5 there further exists certain parking attractors within the city such as miami university public schools municipal facilities business facilities and the hospital which further exacerbate resident parking problems  6 unnecessary vehicle miles noise pollution and strains on interpersonal relationships caused by the conditions set forth herein work unacceptable hardships on residents of these neighborhoods and other residential areas by causing the deterioration of air quality safety tranquility and other values available in an urban residential environment  7 if allowed to continue unchecked these adverse effects on the residents of the city will contribute to a further decline of the living conditions therein a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within said city and consequent injury to the general public welfare  8 a system of preferential resident parking as enacted in this serve to promote the safety health and welfare of all the residents of the city by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel noise and pollution and by promoting improvements in air quality the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living and the increased use of alternative forms of transportation the public welfare will also be served by ensuring a more

commission has established general street guidelines many of the specific technical standards governing the public streets are regulated by the city of oxfords engineering division arelation to adjoining street system 1the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the possible future development of adjacent tracts the planning commission reserves the right to disapprove any street plan which does not represent good design or does not ensure continuity of the existing street system 2offset streets shall be avoided within a proposed subdivision and adjacent to an existing subdivision 3the street and alley arrangements shall be such so as not to cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it 4streets obviously in alignment

entrances to an existing street system unless otherwise determined by the planning commission the spacing of the entrances shall be separated and in accordance with traffic engineering standards dstreet connectivity the purpose of this section is to support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within the city in order to enhance traffic circulation efficiency for drivers pedestrians and bicyclists  promote various modes of transportation  connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as schools and parks  reduce emergency response times  reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel time  increase effectiveness of municipal services delivery 1the following standard shall be met in all new residential development in order to increase connectivity aany residential development shall be required to achieve a connectivity index of 12 or greater unless the planning commission determines that this requirement is impractical due to topography existing development andor natural features a connectivity index is a ratio of the number of street links road sections between intersections and culdesacs divided by the number of street nodes intersections and culdesac heads the following illustration provides an example of how to calculate the index street links on existing adjacent streets that are not part of the proposed subdivision are not included in the connectivity index calculation the measure of connectivity is the number of street links divided by the number of nodes nodes exist at street intersections as well as culdesac

byright under the administrative regulations of underlying zoning districts the planned development is particularly well suited to address two distinct goals of the comprehensive plan to provide for

resources where they already exist 1planned developments share these common goals aprotect the neighbors of a planned development and the city in general to at least the same degree normally inherent in the zoning produce a development equal to or better than that resulting from singleuse or traditional subdivision cfacilitate the construction of a variety of dwelling types to serve comprehensive plan goals of diverse and affordable housing dhave a site and situation that permits comprehensive planning both on the site and relative to its immediate surroundings eresult in a design in which the placement height and uses of buildings vehicle management areas and open spaces efficiently utilize potentials of the site finclude covenants easements and other private measures that will help ensure the longterm administrative viability of a development gbe functional within a time period that helps ensure a viable development 2infill development also satisfies the following goals afully utilize sites that could not be fully utilized because of their shape or because of their location relative to available public access bincrease geographic efficiencies of existing utilities such as public streets water sewer electric telephone and cable by using them where they are already available chelp keep development from sprawling to and beyond the municipal boundaries of oxford 3open space

oxford are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions that increase flood heights and velocities in areas of special flood hazards and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted  cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains

flood hazard so as to protect property and minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water hazards or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters
