member on or after this date shall be allowed to purchase prior law enforcement service time up to five years with such member paying the total actuarial cost the following procedure shall be used to calculate the total actuarial cost of service purchased under this section 1the present value of the expected benefits to be paid to the member from the system shall be calculated as of the members service credit purchase date without regard to the purchase of service 2the present value of the expected benefits to be paid to the member from the system shall be calculated as of the members service credit purchase date including the effect of the purchase of service the additional service credit will be used in both calculating the amount of benefit and in determining the earliest date benefits will commence 3the cost of the service credit purchase to the member as of the service credit purchase date shall be the difference between divisions a2 and a1 above bthe calculation of the above amounts shall be based on the benefit formula in effect as of the service credit purchase date and the following assumptions 1interest discount factor the investment return net of expenses used in the most recently published annual actuarial valuation of the system  2mortality table a blend of 50% of the male rates and 50% of the female rates of the mortality table used in the most recently published annual actuarial valuation of the system  3benefit commencement date the date of earliest retirement assuming continuous accrual of eligibility service from the service credit purchase date  4amount of expected benefit calculated as of the earliest retirement date if the member is not eligible to retire at the service purchase date the expected benefit will be based on service and final average salary fas projected to the earliest retirement date fas for this purpose will be projected from fas as of the service purchase date using the base economic annual rate of pay increase from the most recently published annual actuarial valuation of the system if the member is eligible to retire as of the service purchase date actual service and fas as of the service purchase date shall be used  and 5form of payment 60% joint and survivor actual spousal birth date will be used if available if unavailable or the participant is unmarried at the time of service purchase the female spouse is assumed to be three years younger than the male spouse ctwo examples of the service credit purchase calculation are shown in the following divisions 1example 1 in this example the benefit formula is 26% times final average salary fas times the first 25 years of service plus 275% times fas service in excess of 25 years a member can retire after 20 years of service regardless of age  data as of service credit purchase date members date of birth 1211963 spouses date of birth 211964 service purchase date spd 212007 members age at spd 4313 service at spd 1600 final average salary at spd $62000  athe member wishes to purchase five years of prior law enforcement time  step 1 calculate expected benefit at earliest retirement age before service purchase assuming continuous employment the earliest date the member can retire is 212011 earliest retirement date erd 212011 age at erd 4713 service at erd 2000 fas at erd $7464622 biweekly benefit at erd $149292 present value as of spd $402754   step 2 calculate expected benefit at earliest retirement age after service purchase by purchasing five years the member is eligible to retire on the service purchase date earliest retirement date erd 212007 age at erd 4313 service at erd 2100 fas at erd $62000 biweekly benefit at erd $1302 present value as of spd $468251   step 3 calculate the cost of the service purchase $468251 minus $402754   $65497  bcomment in this example the benefit calculated at erd before the service purchase is larger than the biweekly benefit calculated after the service purchase due to the projected increase in the fas however the present value in step 2 is larger than in step 1 because benefits are expected to be paid out four years longer than in step 1 2example 2 in this example the benefit formula is 26% times final average salary fas times the first 25 years of service plus 275% times fas service in excess of 25 years a member can retire after 20 years of service regardless of age  data as of service credit purchase date members date of birth 111961 spouses date of birth 811960 service purchase date spd 512004 members age at spd 4333 service at spd 2000 final average salary at spd $68000  athe member wishes to purchase five years of prior law enforcement time  step 1 calculate expected benefit at earliest retirement age before service purchase the member is eligible to retire on the spd so this is the erd for this calculation earliest retirement date erd 512004 age at erd 4333 service at erd 2000 fas at erd $68000 biweekly benefit at erd $1360 present value as of spd $444815   step 2 calculate expected benefit at earliest retirement age after service purchase since spd   erd the purchased service increases the annuity but does not change the retirement date earliest retirement date erd 512004 age at erd 4333 service at erd 2500 fas at erd $68000 biweekly benefit at erd $1700 present value as of spd $556019   step 3 calculate the cost of the service purchase $556019 minus $44481500   $111204  bcomment in this example the member was eligible to retire on the service purchase date before the purchase of service voluntary retirement age 1age 52

purpose athe city council hereby finds and declares that the city has a compelling interest in providing its citizens an environment where all persons regardless of race creed color national origin or sex have a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the business and professional life of the city although city state and federal laws have been enacted to eliminate discrimination in employment women and minority group members have not attained equal opportunity in business and the professions one barrier to the advancement of women and minorities in the business and professional life of the city is the discriminatory practices of certain membership organizations where business is conducted and valuable business contacts are made bwhile such organizations may avowedly be organized for social cultural civic or educational purposes and while many perform valuable services to the community the commercial nature of some of the activities occurring therein and the prejudicial impact of these activities on business professional and employment opportunities of minorities and women cannot be ignored cthe council recognizes the interest in private association asserted by club members however the council finds that this interest does not overcome the public interest in equal opportunity membership in certain private clubs and associations extends far beyond the symbolic value attached to it  there is an integral relationship between certain private clubs located within the city and achievement within ones profession job or business executives of many of the citys major corporations banks and trade and professional associations frequently use the facilities of such private clubs rather than public facilities for business meetings of all kinds both formal and informal membership in these clubs and associations affords an individual the opportunity to make business and professional contacts and to get to know and be known by colleagues competitors and governmental leaders membership in such clubs or organizations provides an informal channel or network of communication it is frequently decided who will be considered for a job opening or given a business contact or leadership role in the business community also work on club committees and participation in their programs offers members the opportunity to demonstrate their respective abilities and to achieve distinction and prominence in their endeavors which in turn frequently leads to recognition within the citys business community dsome private membership clubs and associations in the city although avowedly organized for other purposes have distinctly public characteristics and commercial attributes businessrelated and commercial activities are central to the maintenance of such organizations particularly where clubs have more than 200 members provide meal service and rent their facilities directly or indirectly to business firms and professional and trade associations for entertainment conferences or business meetings which may be attended by nonmembers the commercial nature of some private membership clubs and associations is further evidenced by the fact that many members dues and
