under its general police powers set forth in  62115 wis stats to act for the good order of the municipality and for the health safety and welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression 2 the common council recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity in light of  3 wis stats and does not intend by adopting this section to regulate obscenity since nudity in and of itself is not obscene it declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns 3 exhibitions in

41039  criminal and other offensive activity to be offensive to some members of the general public or to children to disrupt the peace and order of the communities to depreciate the value of real property to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of citizens 4 the common council recognizes that the united states supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and therefore entitled to some protection under the first amendment and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights 5 however the common council is aware based on the experiences of other communities that exhibitions in public places in which live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing or video or motion picture presentation thereof occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are

well as other crimes and offenses  the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where these exhibitions featuring nude dancing exist  health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  the probability that children would be exposed to these exhibitions in a public place  and the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct 7 the common council desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of watertown  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 8 the common council has

preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity b no person shall knowingly or intentionally in a public place do any of the following  41039 watertown code

any damages caused or repairs made necessary by a homeowners negligence added by  a unpolluted water exclusion amended by  1 purpose in adopting this subsection the watertown common council finds that the discharge of clear or unpolluted water from roofs surfaces groundwater sump pumps footing tile swimming pools subsurface drainage unpolluted cooling or process water or other natural precipitation into the city sewerage system will and has on numerous occasions in the past flood and overload the sanitary sewerage system to such an extent as to cause significant and grave damage to the property of large numbers of city residents such damage is caused by the backup of sewage into the living quarters of residents and in addition to other damage creates a hazard to health the common council therefore finds it essential to the maintenance of health to the minimization of damage to property and to meet applicable state regulations that the provisions of this subsection be strictly enforced to avoid emergencies in the future 2 definition and regulation no water from any roof surface groundwater sump pump footing tile swimming pool subsurface drainage unpolluted cooling or process water

regulations a a group development is any development containing 1 two or more structures containing principal land uses on the same lot 2 any single structure on a single lot which contains five or more dwelling units or two or more nonresidential uses 3 any new institutional commercial and office buildings in excess of 5000 gross square feet and all multibuilding group developments in which the combined total of all structures on a site regardless of diverse ownership use or tenancy exceeds 5000 square feet 4 any building additions to institutional commercial and office buildings that bring the total building size to over 5000 gross square feet these regulations shall apply to the building addition the older portions of the building constructed prior to the adoption of this article and to the site 5 any new development other than singlefamily residential in the overlay zoning districts described in  550149 550150 and 550151 b common examples of group developments include sixunit apartment buildings apartment complexes condominium complexes strip centers shopping centers and office centers onetenant office or commercial buildings containing less than 5000 square feet of gross floor area fourunit apartment buildings and other land uses in which each nonresidential building contains only one tenant or where the lot contains only one structure or where each residential building contains four or fewer dwelling units are not group developments even though such developments may contain parcels under common ownership c a group development does not offer the ability to customize the regulations of this chapter as could be achieved using a planned development per  55038 a group development approval is not required for an approved specific implementation plan a permitted by right not applicable b conditional use regulations any land use that is permitted as a permitted by right land use or as a conditional land use within the applicable zoning districts is permitted to locate within a group development the detailed land use regulations of this section that pertain to individual land uses shall also apply to individual land uses  55068 general provisions  55069  within a group development as will all other applicable provisions of this chapter therefore land uses permitted by right in the zoning district shall be permitted by right within an approved group development unless otherwise restricted by the conditions of approval imposed during the conditional use approval for the group development as a whole and land uses permitted as a conditional use in the zoning district shall be permitted within the group development only with conditional use approval for the specific use in all cases the following conditional use conditions shall be applied to the group development as a whole and to individual uses within the group development 1 all required offstreet parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development 2 the development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner 3 no group development shall take access to a local residential street 4 all development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this chapter regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines as such individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes that serve to demonstrate complete compliance with said intent said building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments the use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future if such action is so desired 5 the following standards shall apply to all group developments a building exterior materials shall be of high quality on all sides of the structure including glass brick decorative concrete block or stucco decorative architectural metal with concealed fasteners may be approved with special permission from the city b building exterior design shall be unified in design and materials throughout the structure and shall be complementary to other structures in the

for screening and shall be of high aesthetic quality g vehicle access from public streets shall be designed to accommodate peak traffic volumes without disrupting traffic on public streets from inadequate throat length access drive width or design or inadequate driveway location the impact of traffic generated by the proposed development shall be demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis performed by the applicants traffic engineer so as to not adversely impact offsite public roads intersections and interchanges during the traffic peak associated with a full parking lot where the project shall adversely impact offsite traffic the city may deny the application may require a size reduction in the proposed development or may require offsite improvements h parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with a minimum of 400 square feet at all parking islands and in addition shall provide a minimum of one landscaped island of a minimum of 400 square feet in each parking aisle for every 20 cars in that aisle aisleend islands shall count toward meeting this requirement landscaped medians shall be used to break large parking areas into distinct pods with a

this chapter to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with  70327 wis stats as such the provisions of this article are designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development p the plan commission may waive any of the above standards by a threefourths vote of members in attendance but only if supplemental design elements or improvements are incorporated into the project that compensate for the waiver of the particular standard  55069 general provisions  55070  article vii density and intensity  55071 purpose the purpose of this article is to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this chapter see  5509 the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to the area of the site  the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  the zoning districts in which the site is located  the development options the site is developed under  and the uses considered for development rationale this article regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this chapter this article is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of watertown comprehensive plan see also  5505 of this chapter many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this article relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives  55072 how to use this article this article contains the standards that determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this article to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by  55076a should be reviewed this article recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential development in  55076a and b refers to the requirements of  55074 residential density standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential development in  55076a and c refers to the requirements of  55075 nonresidential intensity standards  55073 required natural resources site evaluation a purpose an important goal of the city of watertown comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources that are sensitive to  55071 general provisions  55073  disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodways floodplain areas floodfringe shorelands wetlands drainageways lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources serve important functions that are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water groundwater and soil quality  habitat provisions and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects b mitigation in

subject property 222 editors note appendix c density and intensity standards table is attached to this chapter 223 editors note appendix c density and intensity standards table is attached to this chapter  55073 general provisions  55076  a check comprehensive plan recommendations the citys comprehensive plan should be checked for implications related to the subject property particularly the land use and transportation plan maps copies of the comprehensive plan are available from the city from time to time the comprehensive plan may be amended the citys public works department should be consulted regarding changes to the comprehensive plan that may affect the subject property or its environs b check official map recommendations the citys official map should be checked for proposed capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools parks stormwater management facilities and street improvements which may affect the subject property the official map is on display at the citys public works department from time to time the official map may be amended the citys public works department should be contacted regarding changes to the official map that may affect the subject property or its environs 2 step 2 check the zoning of the subject property the potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located the subject property should be identified on the citys official zoning map see  55018 and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in the official zoning map is on display at the citys public works department from time to time the official zoning map may be amended the zoning administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the official zoning map that may affect the subject property or its environs 3 step 3 complete a natural resources site evaluation for the site the effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated all resources listed in  55073 required natural resources site evaluation should be identified on the subject property located on a map or air photo of the subject property and the total area of the property in acres covered by those resources known as required resource protection area rpa should be determined as should gross site area gsa and the net developable area nda of the subject property c contains a worksheet to simplify these calculations the zoning administrator should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations b instructions for only residential development for steps 1 see above 1 step 4 determine what types of dwelling units are permitted should be checked to determine which types of dwelling  55076 watertown code  55076  units are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property describes each dwelling unit type 2 step 5 check the minimum site area requirement against the gross site area the required minimum site area msa given in the zoning district identified in step 2 should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step 3 above if the gsa is less than the msa required by the selected development option then a different development option must be selected or additional property should be acquired 3 step 6 determine maximum gross density permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd given in the zoning district identified in step 2 above should be noted and used in step 7 below 4 step 7 determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd identified in step 6 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step 3 above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this chapter inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site 5 step 8 check the minimum permitted lot area the minimum lot area mla requirement given in the zoning district identified in step 2 is the smallest size lot permitted within the zoning district the mla must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in step 4 above if the mla given in the zoning district is larger than the lot size requirement given in step 4 then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected in which case it may be advantageous to repeat steps 4 using a different dwelling unit type c instructions for only nonresidential development for steps 1 see above 1 step 4 determine what types of land uses are permitted should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district designated on or proposed for the subject property a complete description of each land use is presented in 2 step 5 check the minimum lot area requirement against the gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum lot area mla given in the zoning district identified in step 2 should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step 3 above if the gsa is less than the mla required  55076 general provisions  55076  by the zoning district then additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa from step 3 must be greater than or equal to the mla from step 5 3 step 6 check the minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the required resource protection area present on the subject property the required landscape surface ratio lsr given in the zoning district identified in step 2 should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step 5 above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step 3 above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required then more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa from step 3 is greater than the lsr the use of more floors may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property 4 step 7 determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far for the zoning district identified in step 2 above should be noted this number will be used in step 8 below 5 step 8 determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far identified in step 7 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step 3 above equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property within that zoning district the ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this chapter inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site 6 step 9 check the maximum building size requirement no and nb district the maximum building size mbs requirement given in the zoning district identified in step 2 above is the largest size building permitted within the neighborhood office and neighborhood business districts the mbs must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in step 8 above if the mbs given in  55075 is smaller than the proposed building size calculated in step 8 above then a smaller building must be built or the use of additional buildings should be considered  55076 watertown code  55076   55077 nonconforming development regulations amended 242014 by  rationale the combinations of maximum floor area ratio far and minimum landscape surface ratio lsr requirements within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district the minimum lot area mla requirements for each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each zoning district is maintained and attainable under efficient site design practices the maximum building size mbs requirements ensure that development within the neighborhood office and neighborhood business districts retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale that is compatible with nearby residential development a blanket conforming status 1 blanket conforming status for any and all requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all development sites in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of  2 after  additional site development that would result in the enlargement expansion or extension of uses structures or other development per 3a to h below will not be allowed to occur without bringing such additional site development into full compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to the extent practical without removal of lawful structures in accordance with the following subsections b below 3 this subsection is intended to

requirements of this chapter this provision addresses two different situations a any structure erected prior to the adoption of zoning that does not meet some or all of the bulk or intensity requirements of this chapter b in some instances this chapter establishes new bulk or intensity requirements that existing legal structures under the previous zoning ordinance do not meet 2 this section therefore ensures that owners of such structures legally established prior to  do not encounter difficulty because the structures would otherwise be considered nonconforming c the following shall apply to all structures that do not meet bulk and other requirements of this chapter 1 ordinary maintenance ordinary maintenance repairs including repairs reasonably necessary to prevent the deterioration of a structure and remodeling of a structure are permitted as well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not extend enlarge or intensify the structure ordinary

safety or welfare d timing of building permit any structure for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this chapter or an amendment to it which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this chapter or that amendment thereto may be completed in accordance with the approved plans provided construction is started within 365 calendar days after issuance of the permit for single and twofamily construction and within 365 calendar days after issuance of a permit for all other development and  55085 general provisions  55085  construction is completed within 730 calendar days two years after the start of construction if all such conditions are met the structure shall thereafter be a legal conforming structure rationale the blanket conforming status provision of above is intended to eliminate the continued classification andor creation of certain structures as nonconforming within the jurisdiction of this chapter this provision addresses two different situations first prior to the provision of fulltime inspection services a number of structures were approved in the city of watertown that did not meet setback requirements second this chapter requires greater side yard setback requirements for certain lot sizes than did previous regulations for similar sized lots the adoption of the provisions of above ensures that structures approved prior to the adoption of this chapter do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming structures  55085 watertown

the interrelationship between the abovelisted sections appendix b provides a table of permitted land uses in permanently protected green space areas226 in part the provisions of this article are designed to ensure the implementation of the city of watertown comprehensive plan and   and 8730 wis stats  55087 how to use this article this article contains the standards that govern the protection disturbance and mitigation of disruption of all natural resources and other permanently protected green space areas the provisions of this article are intended to supplement those of the city of watertown dodge andor jefferson county the state of wisconsin and the federal government of the united states that pertain to natural resource protection prior to using the provisions of this article to determine the permitted disruption of such areas the requirements provided below should be reviewed this article recognizes the important and diverse benefits that natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type and is designed to accomplish several objectives a first a definition of the natural resource is provided b second the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural resource type are provided c third the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given d fourth mandatory protection requirements are identified note protection requirements for specific land uses and

of the following 1 all areas within 75 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of a perennial stream as shown on a detailed onsite survey prepared by the applicant see  550145c8 a where an existing development pattern exists the drainageway for a proposed principal structure may be reduced to the average drainageway of the principal structure on each adjacent lot but the drainageway may not be reduced to less than 35 feet from the ordinary highwater mark of any perennial stream added 10172017 by  2 all areas within 50 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of an intermittent stream or open channel drainageway as shown on a detailed onsite survey prepared by the applicant see  550145c8 a where an existing development pattern exists the drainageway for a proposed principal structure may be reduced to the average drainageway of the principal structure on each adjacent lot but the drainageway may not be reduced to less than 35 feet from the ordinary highwater mark of an intermittent stream or open channel drainageway added 10172017 by  b purpose of drainageway protection requirements drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and lakeshore water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the land water margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative ground cover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderatetorapid water movement  55088 watertown code  55090   55091 woodland overlay zoning district c determination of drainageway boundaries general drainageway boundaries are depicted on the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a drainageway depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of  550145c8 this analysis shall depict the location of all drainageway areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of above d mandatory drainageway protection requirements drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in appendix b per the requirements in  55058 vegetation clearing to maintain drainageway functions is permitted with the written approval of the director of public works all areas designated as drainageways shall be located within a public easement or dedication for maintenance purposes to preserve proper drainage flow a definition woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 80% of an area of one acre or more as shown on a detailed onsite survey prepared by the applicant see  550145c8 b purpose of woodland protection requirements woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions these include atmospheric benefits such as removing airborne pollutants carbon dioxide uptake oxygen production and evapotranspiration returns water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers greatly reducing runoffrelated soil erosion woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion finally under proper management techniques woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources c determination of woodland boundaries general woodland boundaries are depicted on the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a woodland depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements  550145c8 this analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of above d mandatory woodland protection requirements woodlands shall remain

in all woodland areas per the requirements of  55050g a definition steep slopes are areas which contain a gradient of 12% or greater equivalent to a tenfoot elevation change in a distance of 83 feet or less as shown on a detailed onsite survey prepared by the applicant see  550145c8 b purpose of steep slope protection requirements steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption primarily related to soil erosion such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil results in exacerbated erosion downhill and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways wetlands streams ponds and lakes beyond adversely affecting the environmental functions of these resources areas such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the floodwater storage capacity of hydrological system components thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in affected areas beyond these threats to the public safety disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumping unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties buildings and public facilities such as roads and utilities c determination of steep slope boundaries general steep slope boundaries are depicted on the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a steep slope depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of  550145c8 this analysis shall depict the

result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide 233 editors note appendix e landscaping and bufferyard regulations is attached to this chapter  55096 watertown code  55099  a purpose this section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this chapter a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city of watertown this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this chapter bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses b required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards shall not be required in front yards c determination of required bufferyard the determination of bufferyard requirements is a twostaged process first the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using the required bufferyard opacity values table in appendix e234 opacity is a quantitatively derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by the required bufferyard opacity values table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts the provisions of this section indicate the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district boundaries 1 identification of required level of opacity the required bufferyard opacity values table shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard the required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table representing the subject propertys zoning district intersects with the row heading along the lefthand side of the table representing the adjacent propertys zoning district the value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property 2 identification of detailed bufferyard requirements 234 editors note appendix e landscaping and bufferyard

supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows 1 articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required  550148 general provisions  550148  rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated 2 articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in this chapter design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited 3 determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements 4 this chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city of watertown great care has been taken to balance the rights of  550148 watertown code  550148  competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council 5 in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters a no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to this chapter the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation b no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property see  55046 c no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see  55046 and  d no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see  55046 and 550130 e if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to  550142 f effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter these permits and approvals include but are not limited to required site plans special use permits conditional uses and certificates of occupancy g limitations on favorable land use interpretation  550148 general provisions  550148  1 no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation unless a building permit is issued and development is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a occupancy permit is obtained and a use commenced within that period 2 an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued the interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued a favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall for any reason be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more h fee a fee is required for this procedure refer to  550157 i

and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments 3 planned unit developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter in addition to such potential planned unit developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan landscape plan and architectural plan and on a casebycase basis in order to prevent this from occurring all planned unit developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to planned unit developments in addition to the general requirements of this chapter a public hearing process is
