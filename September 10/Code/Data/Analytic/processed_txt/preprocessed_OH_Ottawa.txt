ottawa  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross

offense  bwhen the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2c1 of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the traffic 3c1 of this section does not

nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature ba person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact ca person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist da person acts

negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist ewhen the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element orc 290122 50109 attempt ano person purposely or knowingly and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense shall engage in conduct
