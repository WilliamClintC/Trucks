missouri municipal originally published by book publishing company has been kept current by regular supplementation by municipal its successor in interest during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of rosina sparks city clerk the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 16 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to date no 918 adopted  and adopted  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 16 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to

area calculation signs mounted on a standard geometric shape such as a triangle circle or rectangle shall be measured by the standard mathematical formula for that shape signs mounted on an irregular shape shall be measured by the smallest area of a collection of standard geometric shapes circle triangle or rectangle that can encompass the entire area of the irregular shape no more than three geometric shapes may be used see figure 152 figure 152 standard sign measurements and measurements of signs mounted on irregular shapes b freestanding signs the area of the freestanding or other groundmounted signs shall be computed by the entire area of the face of the structure cabinet or module enclosed by the border of the frame c wall or window signs the area of wall window or other buildingmounted signs shall be computed by means of the smallest continuous perimeter figure which encloses the outer limits of the writing emblem or other display using no more than three standard geometric shapes gaps in writing emblems or other display which are more than two times the width of the tallest element of the sign area and which do not otherwise alter the surface upon which the sign is mounted may be subtracted from the calculation of the sign area where these gaps are excluded from the sign area each area shall be interpreted as a separate sign for the purpose of any sign quantity limitations see figure 153 figure 153 where the gap in portions of the sign is larger than two 2 times the height it shall be counted as two 2 separate signs for any sign quantity limitations that may apply d decorative elements decorative embellishments such as pole covers supporting framework roofing and support structures which are included to enhance the aesthetics and improve the architectural compatibility of the sign with the site and building may be excluded from the area calculation if they contain no writing emblem or other display e doublefaced signs in computing area of a doublefaced sign the area of the largest side shall be considered the total area of the sign however if any interior angle formed by the faces of the multifaced sign or other volume of the sign structure results in any portion of the sign faces being separated by more than three feet then all sides of the sign shall be considered in calculating the sign area see figure 154 figure 154 when the opposite faces or any portion of a sign is separated by less than three feet it is considered one sign and only the area of one sign face is counted towards the total area when that separation is more than three feet each sign face shall count towards the area f height sign height is measured from the lowest point of the ground directly below the sign to the highest point on the sign or sign structure g 3dimensional signs 3dimensional sign area is measured as the profile of the object using the formula in subsection a times the depth using the rule in subsection e that each three feet of depth constitutes a new sign face with the area of the profile for example a 3dimensional sign with a profile area of a and a depth of eight feet would have a total sign area of 3  a figure 155 3d signs are measured by using the area formula for a profile of the object and then multiplying it by one for each threefoot increment of depth for the object  272012   reserved sign districts and

these design guidelines are consistent with the vision and principles of the burlington corridor study they may be used to help interpret the site and building standards of the district they must be used when considering any conditional approvals or exceptions to the standards illustration #10 a building form and design the outer form and design of a building establishes the scale of public spaces and shape the public streetscape faade designs with greater permeability can support a more active and interesting streetscape 1 frontage design  illustration #10  a all buildings shall be placed on the lot to shape positive public space in the burlington corridor including planned and anticipated streetscape arrangements consult the street design concepts in the burlington corridor study for potential street sections on particular segments of the corridor b buildings constructed at the build to should form a more consistent street wall along burlington c rehabilitation of existing buildings should aim to bring sites more in conformance with the setbacks and orientation concepts in the corridor study d where portions of a lot are not fronted by building faades such as an open space or parking area the disruption in the street wall should be minimized to the greatest extent practical by a continuation of the substitute street wall extended from the faade examples of substitute street walls include small courtyard walls constructed of the same material as the principal building ornamental fencing or yearround evergreen landscape materials forming a vertical walllike element 2 height and massing illustration #11 a the height of buildings should establish a ratio of building height to distance between street walls on opposite sides of the block between  or   illustration #11  with the ideal goal being a   illustration #12  relationship this will typically require between 2story and 4story buildings where larger heights are permitted upper portions of buildings should step back to maintain these proportions  illustration #13  b building heights should be consistent along a single block face minor deviations in building heights between five percent 5% to fifteen percent 15% along a single block face are acceptable to add depth and texture to the street wall  illustration #14  c significant deviations in height are acceptable at limited locations on a block provided they are at key intersections to emphasize a focal point within the streetscape d larger buildings of four 4 or more stories or occupying more than onethird  13  of the block face should use more complex massing to break up the form of the building and create a more pedestrian scale e such complex massing should still maintain a consistent street wall at the front building line deviations of more than two 2 feet along a front faade at street level should only be permitted to shape positive and useable outdoor space which improves the relationship and transitions between the streetscape and activities within the building 3 orientation illustration #15 a all buildings should have its primary faade and primary entrance oriented towards the street b pedestrian activity should be directed towards burlington c vehicle activity should be directed towards side streets and rear alley systems or limited in extent when it is necessary for them to be oriented towards burlington d for retail use building entrances should be located more frequently along the streetscape to generate more activity and complimentary pedestrian traffic for nearby uses e areas of the faade immediately associated with the entrance should be reserved for the most ornamental or dynamic elements of the building design f entrance features should be designed at a pedestrian scale  primarily single story and no wider than the smallest architectural bay of the building  illustration # 15 & 17  4 articulationmodulation  illustration #15  illustration #16 a faades that extend more than one hundred 100 feet along the block face should be broken down into architectural bays bays should be a consistent dimension on any single building they may be formed by gangs of windows groupings of architectural ornamentation or pilasters associated with structural and massing elements of a building  illustration #16  b retail uses should use architectural bays of twentyfive 25 feet to fifty 50 feet that coordinate with differentiated storefronts on the street level illustration #17 c expansive areas of blank faades on burlington should be broken up by windows building entrances or ornamental features no more than thirty 30 feet of horizontal blank wall space should exist along burlington without creating greater transparency and articulation combination of these elements 5 transparency a street level faades for retail areas should include significant proportions of transparent display windows no window starting at a level of greater than three and onehalf 35 feet above the street level should be included in the calculation b where the internal operations of the use are such that there is no practical way for the transparency guidelines to be met a limited alternate of boxed display windows or enhanced building ornamentation may be used boxed display windows should meet all other transparency guidelines but may be closed off at a depth of no less than two 2 to three 3 feet c where permitted industrial buildings should use architectural elements and enhanced building ornamentation that complements the building materials and style to break up any blank wall space permitted by the standards fake windows that imitate transparency are not recommended for buildings where lack of transparency may otherwise be acceptable d glazing or heavy tints reflective treatment simulated windows banded windows or glass curtains disrupt the scale and permeability of a building and should not be used 6 building materials a all buildings should be constructed according to the following material standards percentage requirements for materials exclude windows or other openings i primary materials all buildings should have one 1 primary material covering at least sixtyfive percent 65% of the building faades ii secondary materials buildings may have a secondary material covering up to thirty percent 30% of the faades iii accent materials buildings should have at least one 1 and may have up to two 2 accent or trim materials covering between five percent 5% and ten percent 10% of the building faades iv permitted materials exterior materials should be permitted in accordance with the following table primary materials secondary materials accenttrim materials brick unpainted stone unpainted stucco or equal or better simulated materials any of the primary materials may be used as secondary materials glass standing seam metal color concrete any of the primary or secondary materials may be used as an accent material wood trim or equal or better simulated material precast stone or wood moldings or similar architectural details or equal or better simulated material b where equal or better simulated materials should only be used as follows i if the proposed material has an identical physical appearance as the material it intended to simulate including color and texture as perceived from any public spaces surrounding the property  ii if the material presents benefits in addition to cost savings such as reduced maintenance or enhanced durability and performance  iii if the material has a demonstrated track record of successful application and use that will result in equally longlasting and sustainable appeal of the neighborhood as that of the permitted materials  and iv the use of equal or better materials is applied in compliance with all manufacturer specifications c each distinct building material should be of uniform color the compilation of building materials should form a compatible color pallet primary and any secondary materials should use muted or earth tone colors accent and trim materials may use bold or vibrant colors b site design the design of individual sites impacts streetscapes site access and circulation and the function and aesthetics for the entire corridor site designs must account for vehicle traffic in a manner that least disrupts pedestrian activity to and immediately surrounding a building 1 streetscapes a all development should be reviewed in relation to the impact on the longrange street design scenarios in the burlington corridor study refer to the study for the three 3 primary street design scenarios  north area  central area  and south area b individual projects should preserve the potential for these concepts to be done and include site designs that reinforce these concepts with proper building placement and orientation c larger or blockscale projects should implement these concepts on critical segments of the streetscape in association with new development d projects that conflict with these concepts should only be approved on a finding by the city that they will not pursue longterm capital projects for that segment of the street and that incremental implementation series of private projects is not possible 2 curb cuts a curb cuts should be limited on burlington sites that have access by side streets or rear alley systems should use these access points for vehicles b curb cuts on burlington should be consolidated within blocks a single central curb cut that provides access to a shared easement circulation system is preferred c curb cuts on burlington should be as narrow as possible to avoid disruption of the streetscape and pedestrian flow in areas planned for higher pedestrian traffic slower turning movements off burlington are desired and narrower curb cuts should be sued singlelane oneway entry ways with access to more remote portions of the site are preferred over wide access to prominent portions of the site d curb cuts should be designed to provide the least disruption to pedestrian facilities along the corridor and wherever possible the grade and surface shall be maintained over vehicle access points 3 parking location a onstreet parking should be prioritized and permitted to contribute to onsite parking requirements b for any area where a parking management district is established parking requirements should be waived c sites with access to frequent transit service and where the nature of the use of the building is frequented by transit patrons should consider a reduced parking count illustration #18 d parking should be located on remote portions of the site ideally to the rear of the building and accessible to the streetscape from pedestrian passages e where parking is permitted to the side or front of the building it should be screened from the streetscape at the extension of the street wall this screen may be a small courtyard wall constructed of the same material as the principal building ornamental fencing or yearround evergreen landscape materials  illustration #18  f parking areas should be designed as shared space wherever possible for example parking that can serve as a courtyard or similar outdoor space when not in use or for special events are encouraged g parking over the minimum required parking should be discouraged unless it is part of a shared parking program or if it is otherwise mitigated by some improved design features beyond the standards of these guidelines 4 civic open spaces  illustration #19  illustration #19 a areas of the street edge that are not occupied by buildings should be designed as active spaces either as extensions of the public streetscape shared use zones in the burlington corridor study or as civic open spaces associated with the use of the building b civic open spaces should provide space for people to congregate transition from the public streetscape and emphasize important elements of the building or site  illustration #20  illustration #20 c a balance of landscape and hardscape elements for more formal open spaces should be used for these areas illustration #21 d larger buildings with continuous street walls along the streetscape should provide pedestrian passages between the streetscape and any rear parking areas  illustration #21  e where a series of buildings are setback from the street wall for any reason they should be oriented around a common civic space that contains direct pedestrian paths from the streetscape 5 landscape and screening a landscape materials should be used to define the edge of unbuilt portions of sites along the streetscape ie areas without direct building frontages or civic open spaces i landscape materials should form a low edge on all nonbuilding frontages and in particular on any permitted onsite parking areas materials should provide a fourseason screen and should be a minimum thirtysix 36 inches high ii longer expanses of nonbuilding frontages should include vertical elements to reinforce the street wall along the block gaps larger than fifty 50 linear feet should have one 1 two and onehalfinch caliper tree for every thirty 30 feet of frontage species should reach a height of more than thirty 30 feet high at maturity street trees should be consistent with requirements of iii screen any other highintensity site elements mechanical equipment vehicle service bays or loading areas etc from view of the rightofway with landscape elements iv provide ornamental foundation plantings along any building frontages setback from the rightofway by more than ten 10 feet foundation planting beds should be at least eight 8 feet deep v on narrow blocks where two 2 tiers of lots are not possible additional screening techniques and buffer areas should be used adjacent to the public street b develop lowmaintenance landscapes i use lowwater species ii incorporate native plants or use other species that adapt well to the climate seasonal variations and soils of this region c create highperformance landscapes where possible i find opportunities to disconnect paved surfaces from the storm water system and streets landscape areas ii plant species that provide potential to infiltrate storm water where soils and conditions allow iii incorporate landscape designs that enhance the environmental performance and energy programs for the site and building c block scale master plans and shared use area a key component of the burlington corridor study is the shared use area of the streetscape concepts and supporting more pedestrian and urbanscaled development supported by the streetscape concepts the study recognizes that this approach may need to be phased in over time particularly in the north area the easiest way to accomplish this is blockscale master plans where streetscape designs access parking and site design of various owners can be coordinated and where redevelopment of sites can then occur under each landowners individual time frame according to the blockscale master plan the standards and design guidelines support the vision of the burlington corridor study however where sites propose development that deviates from the standards and guidelines it should only be done according to blockscale master plans that support the broader corridor interests beyond the individual site particularly in the north area these plans should advance the following concepts 1 each block shall incorporate additional rightofway or cross access easements that replicate the shared use area of the street design concepts and links to similar pedestrian and shared use areas on adjacent blocks on the corridor 2 crossaccess areas shall replicate the shared use areas or boulevard slip streets for urban areas in a continuous manner along the block including narrow vehicle lanes onstreet parking on one 1 or both sides of the vehicle lane street trees pedestrian areas and streetfront buildings 3 buildings may be set back greater than ten 10 feet from current rightofway provided that all buildings still frame positive shared common or public space along the block similar to the building form and design guidelines 4 additional setback areas may be used for the following provided it is coordinated along the entire lengths of the block a landscape areas including a trail corridor along the burlington corridor  illustration #22 & #23   b parking blocks providing front parking  provided a slip street is located along all lot and building frontages an enhanced pedestrian area is shifted off burlington and provided at the building frontage along the slip street and parking is buffered from the corridor  illustration #23 option 2   or c single or double bays of front parking provided that the parking is buffered from the corridor and a continuous pedestrian easement is provided along all building frontages which directly connects to pedestrian routes on adjacent blocks and the parking areas include connections between pedestrian facilities along burlington and the building frontage areas  illustration #22 option 1  5 any front parking shall include frequent and direct dedicated pedestrian connections between pedestrian routes on burlington and building frontages set back from burlington illustration #22 illustration #23  12142010   administrative procedures a site plan requirement any development in the burlington corridor district shall submit a site plan according to b site plans not meeting a dimensional requirement of the site standards or building standards may

for six months any future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter abandonment of a nonconformity shall terminate the right to continue the nonconformity e control over use no site lot or structure shall hereafter be used or occupied and no structure or part thereof shall be erected moved reconstructed extended enlarged or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located  except that in residential district a lot in an ownership which was of record at the time of adoption of this title

title  11192013   nonconforming uses this section applies to the continuation enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use a continuance the lawful use of any structure existing as of the effective date of this chapter may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter such use may be extended throughout the structure provided that no structural alterations or additions to the structure except those made in conformance with law or ordinance b enlargement a conforming structure in which a nonconforming use is operated shall not be enlarged or extended except as required by law or ordinance c conditions the right of nonconforming uses to continue is subject to such regulations as to the maintenance of the premises and conditions of operation as may in the judgment of the board of adjustment be reasonably required for the protection of adjacent property d change of use 1 changes to conforming uses any nonconforming use may be changed to a use conforming with these regulations established for the district in which the nonconforming use is located provided however that a nonconforming use so changed shall not in the future be changed back to a nonconforming use 2 changes to other nonconforming uses a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use by order of the board of zoning adjustment provided that the new use is determined to be more consistent with the spirit of the zoning ordinance the neighborhood and the comprehensive plan a nonconforming use that is changed to another nonconforming use shall not be changed back to the former nonconforming use all changes of nonconforming uses shall conform to all applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance a nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use that requires more offstreet parking and loading space than the former nonconforming use unless additional adequate offstreet parking and loading space is provided a nonconforming

altered or enlarged conforms with the provisions of this chapter c relocation no structure shall be relocated to a nonconforming site until the site is brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter d abandonment when the use of a nonconforming site has been abandoned for a period of twelve 12 months the site shall not be used developed or improved until it is brought into conformance with this chapter for the purposes of this chapter rental payments or lease payments and taxes shall be not be considered as a continued use and the disconnection of utilities shall constitute a means of establishing the commencement of the abandonment of the use of the development site  11192013   nonconforming lots this section applies to the continuation enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming lot a generally a substandard lot shall comply with the yard buffer setback and bulk regulations of the zoning district that makes the lot conforming with respect to the

section applies to the continuation enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming structure a continuance subject to all limitations in this chapter any nonconforming structure may be occupied operated and maintained in a state of good repair but no nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or extended b enlargement a nonconforming structure in which only conforming uses are operated may be enlarged or extended if the enlargement or extension can be made in compliance with all of the provisions of this chapter established for structures in the district in which the nonconforming structure is located such enlargement shall also be subject to all other applicable city ordinances c termination the right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure is damaged in any manner and from any cause whatsoever and the cost of repairing such damage exceeds fifty 50 percent of the replacement cost of such structure on the date of such damage in determining the replacement cost of any nonconforming structure the cost of land or any factors other than the nonconforming structure itself shall not be included  11192013   certificate of nonconforming use a generally the owner of a nonconformity may register such nonconformity by filing with the director of community development a registration statement b exemptions registration is not required for any use or structure that is made nonconforming by any governmental action other than annexation or rezoning any fence of legal height and construction or any nonconforming lot c contents registration may be made on behalf of the owner by any person firm corporation or other entity that has a legal or equitable interest in the nonconformity registration statements shall require a disclosure of the complete ownership of the land andor structure and shall be in such form and require the furnishing of such information

such nonconformity will result in unnecessary hardship  2 the continuation of the nonconformity will not be contrary to the public interest  3 the continuation of the nonconformity will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming property in the same district  4 the use will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of these regulations and the master plan goals objectives and policies  5 the plight of the applicant for which the continuation of the nonconformity is sought is due to unique circumstances existing on the property andor within the surrounding district  6 the continuation of the nonconformity will not substantially weaken the general purposes of this chapter or the regulations established in this chapter for the applicable zoning district  and 7 the continuation of the nonconformity will not adversely affect the public health safety and welfare c conditions applicable any conditions attached to any rezoning cup variance use permitted by planning commission review or any other development approval or development order issued under any previously enacted zoning regulations subdivision or other land development regulations shall continue to apply to the proposed use and shall be enforceable as provided in this chapter such conditions may be waived if an application is approved pursuant to this chapter whereby the applicant agreed to waive and abandon all right secured under the regulations formerly in effect  11192013 conditional uses purpose a the development and administration of the zoning ordinance is based on the division of the city into districts within any one of which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures as related to land are essentially uniform it is recognized however that there are conditional uses which because of their unique character cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use of the particular location such conditional uses fall into three categories 1 uses operated by a public agency or publicregulated utilities or uses traditionally affected with a public interest  and 2 uses entirely private in character but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities  and 3 uses which are of a short duration and short range impact on the community and thus do not require planning commission review b where a use exists on the effective date of this title and is classified as a conditional use by this title it shall be considered to be a lawful conditional use additions or alterations to existing buildings or land improvements for expansion of lawful conditional uses may be made upon approval of a conditional use permit as set out in this chapter and they shall be subject to yard floor area ratio and building height requirements set forth in this title for permitted uses in the districts in which they are located unless otherwise specifically granted as part of the conditional use permit  part 2002  8252009   conditional uses a the planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city council may provide such conditions and restrictions upon the construction location and operation of a conditional use including time limit provisions for offstreet parking and loading and other conditions as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this ordinance and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the neighborhood failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit for such conditional use b where not otherwise authorized as a permitted use any of the following uses may be located in any district by
