for spaces in mobile home parks continue to exist mobile home owners unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a mobile home for which they must rent a space in a mobile home park alternative sites for the relocation of mobile homes are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces  the restrictions on the age size or style of mobile homes permitted in many parks  and requirements related to the installation of mobile homes including permits landscaping and site preparation additionally the cost of moving a mobile home is substantial and the risk of damage in moving is significant the result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market of mobile home owners and tenants their immobility in turn contributes to the creation of an imbalance in the bargaining relationship between park owners and mobile home park tenants because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income exorbitant rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness b the purpose of this chapter and the amendments in this chapter is to protect mobile home owners from excessive space rent increases and also protect the mobile home owners investments in their mobile homes while at the same time providing a just and reasonable return to park owners c in administering the existing provisions of this chapter the city has found that some provisions and procedures should be simplified or clarified in order to implement the purposes of this chapter more efficiently the amendments in this chapter effect such clarification and simplification and will benefit both mobile home owners and park owners by simplifying rentadjustment procedures d the city council has determined that park owners are requiring prospective mobile home owners in mobile home parks located in the city to enter into or assume longterm leases or rental agreements as a condition to locating in the mobile home park by requiring such longterm leases which the park owners claim are exempt from local rent control under civil 17 park owners appear to be attempting to circumvent the benefits and protections provided by the city of montclair mobile home rent regulation the city council has further determined that as a result of the park owners requirements of longterm leases by prospective mobile home owners current mobile home owners are having extreme difficulty selling their mobile homes prospective purchasers of mobile homes may lose interest in the sale when faced with a longterm lease requirement which includes a rent schedule not subject to city review or regulation f the city council has further determined that as a result of the park owners requirements that prospective mobile home owners sign or assume longterm leases which may be exempt from city rent regulation prospective mobile home owners are being precluded from receiving the benefits and protections intended by this chapter g the city council has further determined that because the current for vacancy decontrol eg permits a park owner to raise space rents without regulation whenever a mobile home located in the park is sold or transferred certain park owners have informed prospective mobile home owners that hisher initial space rents will be substantially increased above space rents which could be charged to the existing mobile home owner and far in excess of the space rents which could be charged if the space rents were at all times regulated alternatively certain park owners have used the threat of these increased initial space rents to coerce prospective home owners to enter into longterm leases which provide for future unregulated space rents far in excess of the space rents which could be charged under this chapter the increased space rents on sale or transfer due to vacancy decontrol have discouraged and frustrated sales of mobile homes in order to sell under such circumstances many existing home owners have been forced to substantially lower the price of their mobile homes thereby jeopardizing their investments other existing home owners particularly those who are elderly are very concerned and worried they also will be unable to sell their mobile homes when the need arises the presence of vacancy decontrol has also caused hardship to prospective mobile home owners who have no protection from initial excessive mobile home space rents in addition these prospective mobile home owners no less than existing mobile home owners need protection against unregulated rent increases when they sell  and the city also has a legitimate interest in protecting the investments that these prospective home owners make in their homes prospective as well as existing home owners tend to be either senior citizens living on fixed incomes or young families struggling to pay for their first homes in either case both need protection against excessive space rents and for their investments in their mobile homes this situation has the potential to cause if it has not already caused adverse effects on the health and welfare of montclair citizens h as a response to the above findings the city council has determined that in addition to the protections already provided by this chapter it is necessary to protect current home owners investments in their mobile homes by precluding park owners from 1 requiring prospective mobile home owners to sign longterm leases therefore adversely affecting sales of mobile homes  and 2 raising space rents upon sales or transfers of mobile homes in a park it is further necessary to 2 protect prospective mobile home owners from excessive rents by providing 1 for lease options in order to give each prospective home owner a real choice between an exempt longterm lease and a lease subject to the protections of this chapter  and 2 that a park owner may not raise space rents upon the sales or transfers of mobile homes in a park it is further necessary to protect prospective home owners future investments in their mobile homes by precluding park owners from 1 affecting future sales of such mobile homes longterm lease requirement imposed upon the subsequent purchasers  and 2 raising space rents upon sales or transfers of mobile homes in a

code  4501 5  3209   1410   2617 graffiti prevention prohibition and removal purpose and intent the city council finds and declares as follows a graffiti on public or private property is a condition of blight that not only depreciates the value of property that has been the target of such vandalism but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties so as to create a negative impact upon the entire community b graffiti has been found to be associated with criminal activity and delinquency it is also a means of identification and intimidation utilized by gangs and its presence may further gangrelated activities the power of graffiti to create fear within the community and blight upon the landscape devaluing property and detracting from a sense of community enjoyed by the residents of the city of montclair goes beyond the cost of cleanup or removal not only is graffiti a criminal act of vandalism but it is also a social crime upon the quality of life and freedom from intimidation that residents desire in their neighborhoods c acts of graffiti are often committed by persons under the age of 18 years using aerosol containers of spray paint andor felttip markers these implements of graffiti are frequently stolen from retail stores by minors  and as such retail stores that display andor sell these implements should be prohibited from selling them to

certain circumstances to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed materials from private as well as public property the city council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and

chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in a  part   floodways since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water

development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  part variance procedure   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for flood plain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level provided that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive 25 dollars for one hundred 100 dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the flood plain administrator in the office of the san bernardino county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the flood plain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  part   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a inclusive are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
