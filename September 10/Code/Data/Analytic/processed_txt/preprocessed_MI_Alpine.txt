alpine charter township kent county the state of michigan and the united states are greatly dependent upon the sustenance and economic benefits provided by a viable agriculture industry the regulations of the agricultural zone are intended to ensure that land areas within alpine township which are well suited for production of food and fiber are retained for such production unimpeded by the establishment of incompatible uses which would hinder farm operations and irretrievably deplete agricultural lands in establishing agricultural zones it is acknowledged that agriculture is a specialized form of industry characterized by the production botanical processes of saleable farm products as a result of the combination of raw materials soils seeds plants water and nutrients manpower farm labor and machinery and energy solar and power equipment other specific purposes for which this district is established include a to preserve woodlands and wetlands associated with farms which because of their natural physical features are useful as water retention surface water purification and groundwater recharge areas and as habitat for plant and animal life  and which have an important aesthetic and scenic value which contributes to the unique character of the agricultural district b to provide the basis for land tax assessments which reflect its existing agricultural

existing stormwater drainage provisions on site are inadequate 2 there is insufficient onsite parking to satisfy current zoning or a hard surface parking area is needed to reduce dust and reduce gravel and dirt runoff into the public stormwater drainage system 3 existing driveways may result in hazardous vehicle movements 4 additional plantings are needed in order to comply with the intent of the alpine township landscape guidelines or replace trees and shrubs previously removed and screening is needed in the form of fencing or landscaping to provide a buffer between uses particularly to screen materials stored outside 5 access to adjoining properties is inadequate and can be improved by way of parking lot connections or installation of a service drive to improve traffic circulation and reduce the number of turning movements onto the public street system 6 safety for pedestrians can be improved and better emergency vehicle access can be provided 7 better lighting conditions are needed to reduce or eliminate nuisance lighting situations for drivers and nearby residents 8 screening of dumpsters is needed to improve the appearance of a site and reduce the likelihood of

plat however may not be compatible with farm operations and may therefore not be appropriate in all locations in the ra zone such projects are essentially subdivisions alpine twp zoning  special uses 2101  2110 special uses the construction of several nonfarm residences which would be built over a period of years in the vicinity of an active farm are unlikely to adversely affect the farm operation a subdivision however in the same location would be much more rapid in occurrence and of greater scale and therefore poses more of a threat to the viability of the farming operation in order to protect the viability and integrity of farm operations to guard against the premature loss of farmland as well as to provide a measure of protection for nonfarm residents from the nuisance characteristics of farming subdivisions shall be subject to special approval by the planning commission such a procedure will enable the commission to more effectively manage the location size and

in the alpine township master plan b site location standards  subdivisions in the ra zone shall be located according to the following criteria 1 subdivision shall have direct access to a paved roadway 2 subdivisions shall be located such that they are part of a logical residential growth pattern extending outward from developed or developing residential areas so that such projects do not leapfrog

danger to the natural resources of the township and the region  3 land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased storm water runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  4 storm water runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  5 increases of storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and cause deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities  6 storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution due to land development within the township have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities  7 increased storm water runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with storm water runoff from future development projects within the township will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the townships water bodies and water resources and those of downstream municipalities  8 storm water runoff soil erosion and

three storm water management zones zones a band c are hereby established the zones are shown on the map attached as appendix a and made a part of this ordinance 1 zone a represents areas which require the most protective storm water management regulations the goal of this zone is to preserve the natural condition of water bodies included in it in whole or in part zone a has in general little impervious surface area and few storm water facilities in this zone when site conditions permit infiltration of storm water runoff shall be required ratherthan the directed flow of storm water runoff into water bodies this storm water management practice provides greater protection for surface water quality and also assists in augmenting stream base flow reduction of flash storm flows and prevention of stream bank erosion specifies design criteria for zone a in order that the volume and rate of storm water runoff are controlled at predevelopment levels 2 zone b represents developed areas that have significant impervious surfaces and storm water runoff facilities in place the goal of zone b is the control of storm water runoff in order to prevent further destabilizing of streams and other water bodies in this zone the use of detention ponds the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips and other measures to reduce directlyconnected impervious areas are specified in for the achieving of the storm water management standards applicable to zone b the management practices for this zone are intended to maintain existing water quality and toalleviate adverse downstream impact on water bodies 5 zone c consists of highly urbanized areas or areas where there has been significant modification of drainageways the amount of impervious surface area in zone c is generally greaterthan 25% among the measures required in zone c as stated in are the use of sediment basins the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips along water bodies and the reduction of impenious surface areas that are directly connected to water bodies an important element of storm water management practice in zone c is the control and prevention of sedimentation in order to reduce pollution of water bodies design standards the design standards for storm water runoff facilities for zones a b and c as described in are the following zone a zone b zonec criteria high quality waters degraded physical biological heavily degraded meets water quality or water quality indicators physical biological standards less than 10% 10% to 25% imperviousness or water quality imperviousness indicators
