findings in adopting these standards which apply to adult businesses the borough has made the following findings in regard to the secondary effects on the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the borough the findings are based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the borough and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theaters 427 us 50 1976 and northend cinema inc v seattle 585 p 2d 1153 wash 1978 and

los angeles california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  beaumont texas  and new york city new york  and also on findings found in the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota 1 health concerns the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses and adult uses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 2 behavior certain employees of sexually oriented business regulated by this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows as regulated by this chapter as adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motion picture theaters or adult arcades 4 unhealthy conditions offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 sexual activities persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection aids genital herpes hepatitis b non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  and the incidence of many of these diseases is on the increase 7 unhealthy conditions sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8 bodily fluids numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 9 accountability classifying adult businesses as conditional uses is a reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and conditions and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or 201809 borough of west hazleton zoning for specific uses page viii  2 solicitation 10 externalities there is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime the downgrading of property values and the decline of the overall character of the community a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this 11 operational characteristics it is generally recognized that adult businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this 12 reason for control the borough desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life preserve property values and the character of the surrounding community b intent it is the intent of this 42073 to 1 secondary effects regulate adult business in order to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing the secondary effects on the community which are associated with such businesses and which include difficulties for law enforcement trash disposal deleterious effects on business and residential property values increased crime particularly the corruption of morals of minors and prostitution and drive residents and businesses to move elsewhere 2 zoning district designate a zoning district where adult businesses are permitted and establish reasonable content neutral standards applicable to
