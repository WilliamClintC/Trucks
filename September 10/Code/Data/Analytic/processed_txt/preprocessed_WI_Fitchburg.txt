of neighboring developed areas 2 building masses and long straight building fronts and sides relative to the overall length of the building that are visually accessible shall be broken up and made more variegated with staggers and offsets with landscaping or surficial features or with accumulation of mass in the form of smaller related units this is a directive standard as to residential and commercial structures and those industrial structures that are visually accessible to larger volumes of traffic and a recommendatory standard to industrial buildings within the center core of industrial districts 3 within residential properties parking areas that are located in front or streetside yards must have landscape screening andor screening by fencing having decorative character to soften views of parked vehicles all design reviewed parking lots shall have decorative landscape treatment at the perimeter of the lot and for larger lots in island areas within the lot to provide breakup of the expanse of paving see section 22609 4 mechanical equipment heating air conditioning and ventilation that will be readily visible when viewed from ground level from other properties or from major public ways should be softened by screening or covered in a manner that forms an integral part of the building design 5 external garbage or refuse containers shall be screened by walls fences berms or effective landscaping or combinations thereof 6 landscaping each project subject to design review must provide landscaping of sufficient height and density to accomplish positive visual impact within three years from the time of planting 7 all developments and occupancies subject to design review shall be planned and constructed so that surface drainage drains from structures impervious surface ratios shall be limited to no more than 65 percent except where a different level has been set forth approved plan land division approval other zoning standard or other zoning approval the commission in its judgment may allow a higher ratio provided it is not contrary to an existing approval and onsite infiltration pervious pavement or other measures to mitigate the higher ratio are provided and maintained 8 the following principles of landscape design are stated as guides to be applied with discretion by the plan commission taking into account how visible the site is to public view sensitivity of neighboring properties and the cost considerations a overhead canopy trees contribute to a pattern within the neighborhood and streetscape focus plantings trees or shrubs accomplish screening of less attractive elements afford privacy noise control and windbreak soften transitions from vertical to horizontal features and create visual focal points b ground plane

regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  31 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such licensing procedure will place an incentive for operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  32 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments  33 the disclosure of certain information by those ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity  34 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct prohibited in this article and a sexrelated crime is substantially related to the licensed activity of operating owning or controlling a sexually oriented business f the united states supreme court and various federal and state courts have held that a local unit of government such

of their findings and basis for this article and its regulations i adultoriented establishments in proximity to residential areas places of worship parks day care centers and schools may and do often lead to an increase in criminal activities in the surrounding areas and the city desires to protect the youth of the community from the deleterious effects such businesses can have on adjacent areas by restricting their close proximity to certain public and private uses and protect its citizens and residents from increased crime as well as increased ordinance violations such as but not limited to

infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct k the common council of the city recognizes they lack authority to regulate obscenity in light of wis stats  3 and do not intend by

erotic dancing in bars taverns and other adultoriented establishments l the common council of the city recognizes that the us supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the

prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby 1 protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city  2 protect the citizens from increased crime  3 preserve the equality of life  4 preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  5 deter the spread of urban blight  and 6 ensure and facilitate health welfare peace tranquility and good order of

hearing examiner finds that the landlord failed to comply with an order of the building inspection department to correct by the original due date a rent impairing violation as that term is defined in section 721 the hearing examiner shall order that rent be abated retroactive to the date of the initial inspection in order to effectuate the purpose of this article and to provide fair and equitable compensation to the tenant for the diminished value of the rented premises due to the landlords continued violation of the citys buildinghousing codes 2 any such abatement shall be established in accordance with the schedule of rent impairing violations in section 72345 in setting the exact percentage of abatement the hearing examiner shall consider the nature extent and seriousness of the particular conditions the total number of rent impairing violations at issue the length of time the conditions existed and the extent to which the conditions deprive the tenant of full use of the rented premises 3 if the hearing examiner finds that the landlords failure to comply with the order of the building inspection department by the due date was caused by factors wholly outside the landlords control and if the hearing examiner further finds that the landlord has taken affirmative steps to minimize the impact of the uncorrected rentimpairing conditions on the tenant any sums reasonably expended by the landlord in that regard should be considered in setting the percentage of abatement and may operate to reduce the final abatement percentage below the minimum percentage listed for the items in the schedule of rent impairing violations in section 72345 4 the hearing examiner shall not authorize rent abatement for any conditions found to be caused either negligently or willfully by the tenant or hisher guests nor shall abatement be ordered for any period of time after the tenant has unreasonably refused entry to the landlord for the purpose of correcting the conditions giving rise to the violations b in favor of landlord 1 if after hearing the hearing examiner finds that the landlord did not fail to comply with an order of the building inspection department to correct a rent impairing violation by the due date or that the rent impairing violations were caused by the tenant or the tenants guests or that the tenant unreasonably refused entry for the purpose of correcting a rent impairing violation the hearing examiner shall enter an order denying the request for authorization to abate rent for any items negligently or willfully caused by the tenant or guests of the tenant or for any items which remained uncorrected due to the tenants unreasonable refusal to allow entry for repair purposes 2 where the landlord has received a list of code violations requiring correction within 72 hours or less a refusal by the tenant to allow entry after reasonable notice of less than 24 hours may be deemed an unreasonable refusal solely for the
