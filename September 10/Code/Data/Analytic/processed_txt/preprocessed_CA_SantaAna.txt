these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses  72009 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize

property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  72009 methods of reducing flood loss in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in

floodways since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one 1 foot at any point within the city b within

is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge c if subsection 722a and b are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article iii  72009 article iv  floodplain variance procedure nature of floodplain variances the issuance of a floodplain variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a floodplain variance the floodplain variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that floodplain variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a floodplain variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners floodplain variances shall be approved only in rare circumstances the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if floodplain variances are strictly limited therefore the floodplain variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a floodplain variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a floodplain variance are more appropriate  72009 conditions for floodplain variances a generally floodplain variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles ii and iii have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the floodplain variance increases b floodplain variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in section 75 upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c floodplain variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of floodplain variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city finds will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter e any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a floodplain variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the county recorders office of the county of orange and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all floodplain variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such floodplain variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  72009 appeals a in passing upon requests for floodplain variances the citys planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the floodplain variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a floodplain variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters c floodplain variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of section 725 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of such factors the planning commission may approve deny or approve with conditions any request for a floodplain variance e the planning commission shall hear such other appeals as are authorized by this chapter  72009 article v  public works management standards general development standards the floodplain administrator shall review the following proposals for development in the special flood hazard area a all public works construction proposals  b all tentative subdivision maps  and c all development proposals referred to him pursuant to section 725  and shall approve conditionally approve or disapprove them based on
