building permit issuance if the city council revises the impact fee formula or the impact fees themselves prior to the time that a building permit is issued for a particular development the formula or fee amount in effect at the time of building permit issuance shall apply to the development 4the city shall use as a basis to predict the amount of new average daily trips created by any proposed development the current edition of the publication titled trip generation an ite informational report published by the institute of transportation engineers or other factual basis accepted by the public works director 5this impact fee owed for a development shall be determined by multiplying the number of predicted new average daily trips by the impact fee amount per average daily trip as computed in wmc  6if the predicted number of average daily trips for a property is less than the existing number of average daily trips from the existing uses on the same property as a result of the proposed development transportation impact fees will not be assessed by the city the highest number of predicted average daily trips from a previous use of the site since 2005 will be used as a basis for number of existing average daily trips generated by that property 7the number of average daily trips remains with the property or lot and cannot be moved traded bought sold or transferred to another property within the city     impact fee adjustments independent calculations a fee payer may request an adjustment to the impact fees determined according to the fee schedule adopted by this chapter by preparing and submitting to the public works director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought said independent fee calculation must be supported by studies and data the documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made the city may in its sole and exclusive discretion also adjust the applicable fee at the time of imposition where unusual circumstances exist 1if the public works director agrees with the independent fee calculation a written agreement to accept such amount shall be transmitted to the fee payer who shall in turn present it to the permit center upon impact fee collection 2if the public works director does not agree with the independent fee calculation the fee payer may appeal this decision to the hearing examiner outlined in wmc    impact fee credits 1a developer shall be entitled to a credit against the transportation impact fee collected under the fee schedule adopted by this chapter in any of the following situations awhenever a project is approved subject to a condition that the developer actually provide a particular system improvement  bwhenever a developer has agreed pursuant to the terms of a voluntary agreement with the city to provide a particular system improvement  or cwhenever a developer or property owner developer dedicates conveys or contributes land rightofway andor improvements for use by the city for a system improvement separate from or in advance of filing a land use application or a development application that otherwise qualifies for a credit against the transportation impact fee adopted by this chapter provided however any credit to which a developer is otherwise entitled by this section shall be reduced or offset by any unpaid amount due and owing by the developer to the city for system improvements under the terms of a development agreement or other contractual agreement entered into between the developer and the city dany credits authorized and approved in compliance with this section may be used by the developer as provided in this section or may be transferred by the developer to another developer other than a developers lender a purchaser at a foreclosure sale or their transferee for use against a transportation impact fee collected against the development of the transferees real property the transfer of any credits by the developer or subsequent party shall be recorded with the director of public works and the king county department of records within 30 days of the transfer on a form provided by the city executed by both the developer and the transferee provided however a transfer of credits shall not be authorized or approved if there are unpaid monies due and owing by the developer to the city for system improvements constructed by the city pursuant to a development agreement or other contractual agreement between the developer and the city 2if in any of the cases in subsection 1 of this section the land dedicated facility constructed or fee paid is allocated partly toward system improvements and partly toward project improvements the credit shall be limited to that portion allocated to system improvements 3for the purposes of calculating the credit the land value or costs of construction shall be determined as follows athe amount of credit for land dedicated shall be by an appraisal conducted by an independent professional appraiser chosen by the fee payer from a list of at least three such appraisers provided by the city the cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the fee payer for the purposes of this section the date of value shall be the date the land was dedicated to the city the appraisal shall only value the land dedicated and not any alleged damages to any abutting property bthe amount of credit for facilities constructed shall be based upon the actual cost of construction at the time of construction supported by invoices and other required records deemed reasonably necessary by the public works director the cost to construct required frontage improvements to existing streets including but not limited to the cost to construct curb and gutter and street widening for noncapacity purposes illumination systems storm drainage systems sidewalks and walkways and landscaping shall not be included in the amount of credit for facilities constructed as system improvements 4this subsection 4 applies only to residential developments and the residential portion of a mixed use development in cases where a developer would be entitled to a credit under this section but the amount of the credit has yet to be determined on a per dwelling unit basis the city shall take the total credit amount available to the entire plat or project calculated by applying subsections 1 3 of this section and divide that amount by the number of dwelling units approved for that plat or project the impact fee and credit may then be calculated and collected on a per dwelling unit basis as building permits are issued for those dwelling units where building permits for some but not all of the dwelling units within a plat or project have already been obtained at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective the credit for the unpermitted dwelling units will be calculated to arrive at a per dwelling unit amount in the same manner for example if a plat has been approved for 20 dwelling units and building permits have only been issued for 10 of those units the per dwelling unit credit for the remaining 10 units will equal the total credit amount divided by 20 dwelling units 5this subsection 5 applies to nonresidential developments or the nonresidential portion of a mixed use development in cases where a developer would be entitled to a credit under this section but the amount of the credit has yet to be determined on a per square foot basis the city shall take the total credit amount available to the entire plat or project calculated by applying subsections 1 3 of this section and divide that amount by the number of square feet approved for that plat or project the impact fee and credit may then be calculated and collected on a per square foot basis as building permits are issued for that square footage where building permits for some but not all of the dwelling units within a plat or project have already been obtained at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective the credit for the unpermitted square footage will be calculated to arrive at a per square footage amount in the same manner for example if a 20000squarefoot commercial project has been approved and building permits have only been issued for 10000 square feet of the project the per square foot credit for the remaining 10000 square feet will equal the total credit amount divided by 20000 square feet 6determinations made pursuant to this section may be appealed to the examiner under wmc  7a credit must be requested within 30 days of building permit issuance or it is deemed waived 8no refund will be allowed in the event that the impact fee credit calculation exceeds the amount of the impact fee itself       impact fee refunds 1the current owner of property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within six years of their receipt by the city in determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in first out basis

earned shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which an impact fee was paid upon the finding that all fee requirements are to be terminated the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by firstclass mail addressed to the owner of the property at the owners last known address all funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year at the end of one year any remaining funds shall be retained by the city but must be expended for the original purposes consistent with the provisions of this section the notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account

chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities including the activities of sexually oriented business patrons in order to promote health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of woodinville and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexually oriented businesses within the city it is not the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the city that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the state or federal constitutions or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented material to their intended market neither is it the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials att a 2016  findings of fact based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the woodinville city council and to other jurisdictions including but not limited to the testimony of law enforcement officers and members of the public and on other evidence information publications articles studies documents case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the city council and staff the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies the city council makes the following findings 1certain conduct occurring on premises offering sexually oriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein 2regulation of the sexually oriented business industry or licensing is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred 3it is necessary to license entertainers in the sexually oriented industry to prevent the exploitation of minors  to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult  and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible 4the evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexually oriented businesses is compelling the provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexually oriented uses in woodinville are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather often in large numbers 5it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexually oriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexually oriented business so there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees 6the license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the sexually oriented businesses and in increased police costs in enforcement 7businesses providing sexually oriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution disruptive conduct and other criminal activity such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety the hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities 8due to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexually oriented businesses there is concern over sexually transmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health safety and wellbeing of the public 9many cities including seattle and tacoma have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexually oriented business land uses the skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of seattle such an effect would be significantly magnified in woodinville due to the difference in size and characteristics of the city 10the city of woodinville may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexually oriented business use operations and licensing 11the city takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexually oriented businesses 12regulation of sexually oriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than in response to an existing problem 13increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexually oriented businesses additionally hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits avoiding payment of taxes and racketeering have historically occurred in sexually oriented businesses in the absence of regulations 14the city council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter 15there are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of time place and manner under which sexually oriented businesses can operate 16it is not the intent of this chapter to unconstitutionally suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution or of the washington state constitution but to enact content neutral chapters which address the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses 17in a family community sexually oriented businesses are not uniformly compatible with community standards as defined during the numerous public hearings 18the law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by sexually oriented businesses are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing sexually oriented businesses and those associated with them 19in order to assure that all conditions regulations etc are met the city has established a reasonable time period for review of license applications att a 2016  definitions for the purposes of

201 woodinville is a safe friendly familyoriented community that supports a successful balance of neighborhoods parks and recreation tourism and business we have preserved our northwest woodland character our open space and our clean environment we have enhanced our ability to move freely throughout the community by all modes of travel woodinville is a pleasant place in which to live work play and visit with a compact inviting downtown that is attractive and functional 2more specifically the purposes of these commercial design standards are to guide development in a manner that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing promotes social and economic vitality and fosters an enhanced sense of safety comfort interest and identification between people and their environment additionally the purpose of these commercial design standards is to encourage development that meets the goals and policies of the city of woodinville comprehensive plan for community design these goals are agoal cd1 to promote an image of a visually cohesive community to residents and visitors bgoal cd2 to maintain the northwest woodland character and heritage of woodinville cgoal cd3 to promote quality design that preserves and enhances the character of woodinville dgoal cd4 to create pedestrianfriendly environments in woodinville egoal cd5 to encourage the arts as a vital contributor to community design att a 2016  administrative procedures 1the director will report design review activity regularly to the planning commission who will serve as the monitor for these commercial design standards the city is committed to incorporating design review procedures that aapply to all commercially designated property within the city  ballow for flexibility to accommodate creative design that meets the intent of adopted standards  cdo not prolong approval processes  and dencourage design review that parallels development design for economy of design resources 2applicants will have opportunity to informally discuss and formally review proposed designs throughout the design process including preapplication project permit review and final construction design review 3where the director is provided with administrative flexibility under this code heshe shall develop a written record of consultation with other department heads design review committee or with the citys contract design professional by project att a 2016  applicability 1all new construction within the cbd o tb gb and nb zones shall be subject to all chapters of the design standards the downtown and little bear creek corridor study area has some additional specific design standards that are incorporated into the commercial design standards 2figure 1 identifies the downtown and little bear creek corridor dtlbcc study area additionally this area is divided into design districts with special use provisions and guidelines to create the following characteristics in each district acivicgateway design district public and high visibility eg hotel uses emphasis on attractive streets landscaping and pedestrian connections development standardsguidelines emphasize design character as seen from streets and pedestrian connections bpedestrian core design district highly integrated mix of smaller pedestrianoriented commercial services specialty shops restaurants personal services communityoriented retail etc and residential residential dwelling units are required subject to applicable development conditions under wmc  offices above the ground floor are encouraged the goal is to develop at least 1000 dwelling units in this area to support retail and provide activity development standardsguidelines emphasize pedestrianoriented streets efficient but nonintrusive auto access plazas small open spaces and amenities and human scale high quality architecture also important is to provide enough development capacity to ensure feasible high quality development while modulating building bulk to retain sunlight and views ceast frame design district mix of uses including accommodation of larger format retail centers development standardsguidelines emphasize integrated site development with good interior pedestrian circulation ample garden like landscaping compatibility with adjacent uses minimization of service area impacts and an attractive eastern entry into the downtown dlittle bear creek design district general commercial and office uses buildings of up to 60 feet in height are allowed if development includes structured parking and greensward corridors on the side yard that provide pedestrian connections to the creek and water quality treatment the emphasis is on enhancing the environment and providing access to little bear creek etransition area design district mix of uses including accommodation of medium format retail centers development standardsguidelines emphasize many of the same characteristics of the east frame but focus on transitioning to the residential areas to the east image figure 1 downtown and little bear creek corridor design districts 3alteration of any structure on commercially designated property within the city that affects the exterior appearance of a building shall be subject to design review under the design standards while woodinville would benefit greatly if all the design standards were met when existing properties are altered such a strict application of the design standards might disadvantage property owners or discourage them from improving their buildings the city has established two thresholds to gauge the extent of remodeling and set requirements based on what is practical and reasonable for that level of improvement aif 50 percent or more of a building or structure subject to design review is altered within a period of three years the structure shall be subject to the applicable requirements that do not involve repositioning the building or reconfiguring site development as determined by the director bif less than 50 percent of a building or structure subject to design review is altered within a period of three years the requirement is only that the proposed improvements meet the standards andor guidelines and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards and guidelines for example if a property owner decides to replace a building facades siding then the siding shall meet the applicable exterior building material and color standards andor guidelines but elements such as building modulation would not be required 4the design standards checklist will be used for addressing design issues in all review processes   att a 2016  alternative commercial design standards the director may approve departures from any of the standards set forth in this chapter  provided 1the departures are consistent with and substantially implement the objectives concepts and guidelines set forth in the downtown vision and illustrative guide june 2018 approved by the city council pursuant to resolution 524  and 2a development agreement is obtained pursuant to wmc where substantial compliance with the downtown vision and illustrative guide is included in the terms of the development agreement  and 3the applicant submits with their application for design review specific identification of proposed departures from those commercial design standards set forth in this chapter in favor of specific identified provisions of the downtown vision and illustrative guide june 2018   interpretation 1where there is a conflict between these design standards and other city plans policies and regulations the most specific standard guideline or regulation shall apply as determined by the director for example this title provides for a minimum street setback of 10 feet in commercial districts whereas the design standards allow buildings to be placed on the front property line as long as they meet certain design requirements while the design standards herein are less restrictive in this case they are more specific in that they allow for zero setbacks if certain conditions are met therefore the director will determine that they apply 2each section of the design standards contains a list of intent statements followed by design principles and subsequent implementing measures specifically aintent statements are overarching objectives for example the intent statement for the building corners section is to create visual interest and increased activity at street corners project applicants must be able to demonstrate how their project meets the intent to the directors satisfaction bdesign principle statements describe broad actions that are necessary to achieve the intent ca collection of standards implements the design principles specifically istandards that use words such as shall must isare required or isare prohibited signify required actions iisome standards take a tool box approach in that a development may be required to include at least two design elements from a large list of options iiistandards using words such as should or isare recommended signify recommended actions that are meant to be applied with some flexibility development projects must comply with such measures unless the development proposal meets the intent in some other manner as determined by the director dfurthermore the document contains some specific standards that are easily quantifiable while others provide a level of discretion in how they are complied with in the latter case the applicant must demonstrate to the director in writing how the project meets the intent of the standard 3words within the standards and guidelines that are italicized in the ordinance codified in this chapter are defined in wmc  att a 2016  design

noticeable qualities are the overall form and color a threestory commercial building that is 100 feet wide and 35 feet tall must be observed at least 200 feet away in order for the building to fit within a persons cone of vision so its overall shape can be perceived at that distance windows doors and other major features are clearly visible however within 60 to 80 feet from the building approximately the distance across a typical downtown street a person notices not so much the buildings overall form as its individual elements closer the most important aspects of a building are its design details texture of materials quality of its finishes and small decorative elements in a pedestrianoriented business area it is essential that buildings and their contents be attractive up close therefore these design standards include implementing measures which require all buildings to incorporate design details and small scale elements into their facades aall new buildings and individual storefronts shall include on the facades that face a street park or pedestrian route at least four of the following design features idecorative rooflines such as an ornamental molding entablature

weakly attached or lowvigor branches in a manner that should not reduce the canopy topping  the cutting of a trunk or main branch to the point where there is no branch large enough and vigorous enough to become the new leader crown thinning  selective removal of branches throughout the crown of the tree to improve interior light and air remaining branches should be welldistributed and balanced stripping  removing the branches from the inner section of the trunk or branch can cause structural imbalances and potential failure crown raising  removal of the lower branches of the tree to provide height clearance typically 8 feet for pedestrians and 16 feet for vehicles imbalance  removing portions of the tree and creating an imbalance in the structure of the tree can cause cracking damage from the wind or weak new growth windowing  removing several branches symmetrically within an area of the trees crown to enhance views excessive pruning  removing portions of the tree to a point where it can kill the tree can invite decay and disease   additional enforcement in addition to the enforcement provisions set forth in chapters 106 and 2112 wmc the following shall apply to enforcement of
