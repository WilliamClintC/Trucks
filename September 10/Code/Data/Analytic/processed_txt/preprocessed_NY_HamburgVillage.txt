findings  purpose  objectives a the village board of trustees of the village of hamburg finds that the potential andor actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the village of hamburg and that such damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing damage to public facilities both publicly and privately owned and injury to and loss of human life in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth this chapter is adopted b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 regulate uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages  5 regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 qualify for and maintain participation in the national flood insurance program c objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use

associated increases in siteimpervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitats for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from  19825 stormwater

stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  4 minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality  5 minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable  and 6 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution
