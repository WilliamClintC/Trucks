consisting of 20 members appointed by the mayor of the city of quincy unless otherwise noted a over the years maintaining public order has shifted from being primarily the responsibility of families communities and individuals assisted by police officers to being primarily the responsibility of the police alone in the process enforcing laws and exacting penalties have become the principal if not the sole response to public order and safety issues b community policing reverses that trend by recognizing that the community at large is responsible for the conditions that generate crime deterrence law enforcement and incarceration by themselves cannot resolve the underlying conditions that cause crime and social disorder in fact specific responsible people within the community have as much to do with the overall policing of the community and the regulation of conduct as uniformed police officers c to cultivate this transition an educational process and heightening of awareness must take place the community must accept and share responsibility with the police for social order and both must work cooperatively in order to identify problems and develop proactive communitywide solutions the police must acknowledge that they cannot do the job alone recognize that they have valuable resources available to them within the community and understand that the community must be involved in the problemsolving process in turn government and community leaders must recognize and accept responsibility for keeping their neighborhoods safe communities must take a unified stand against crime violence and disregard for the law the police department must help build stronger more selfsufficient communities communities in which crime and disorder will not thrive d community policing is democracy in action all who share a concern for the welfare of the neighborhood should bear responsibility for safeguarding that welfare a commission members shall include permanent members and

health hazard exists from exposure to improperly disposed infectious waste stringent federal and state regulations require that specified methods of infectious waste storage packaging and disposal be practiced by both the generator and the disposal contractor at the same time this geographical area is experiencing diminished landfill capacity thus promoting incineration as the preferred disposal method although incineration is most commonly used by hospitals the largest quantity generators of infectious waste problems of incinerator acceptability by the public greatly restrict this disposal method as a result disposal costs continue to escalate particularly for the small quantity generator of infectious waste all of these factors contribute to the increased potential for the improper disposal of infectious waste  17511 authority  purpose  applicability pursuant to mgl c 111  31 the city adopts the ordinance codified in this article which is designed to impose strict penalties upon persons andor entities responsible for any infectious waste which is improperly disposed of within the boundaries of the city this article shall apply to all generators and all disposal contractors affiliated with the disposal of any type of infectious waste  17512 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated improper disposal of infectious waste  any action or lack of action which causes infectious waste to be disposed of in a manner contrary to the requirements for proper disposal as specified in  17514 infectious waste  waste which because of its infectious characteristics may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness and which may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated stored transported disposed of or otherwise managed infectious waste includes isolation wastes cultures and stocks of etiologic diseasecausing agents blood and blood products pathological wastes contaminated laboratory wastes sharps syringed needles scalpels etc dialysis unit waste animal and body parts biologicals and contaminated food and patientcare wastes infectious waste disposal contractor  any person or company responsible for the proper and legal disposal of solid waste including
