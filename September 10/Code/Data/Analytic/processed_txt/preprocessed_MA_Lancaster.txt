bylaw to protect the towns interest to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the town of lancaster by creating areas around locales where children and the elderly regularly congregate and wherein certain sex offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence a it is determined that this bylaw is the most narrowly crafted means of restricting to the fullest extent possible the opportunity for registered sex offenders to approach or interact with children and the elderly where they routinely and naturally congregate and that the protections of the health and safety of our children is a compelling public and governmental interest b this bylaw is intended to create a civil nonpunitive regulatory scheme in order to protect children and the elderly to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of public welfare protections and not as a punitive measure of any kind c registered sex offenders pose a clear threat to children and the elderly as vulnerable groups residing in or visiting the town because registered sex offenders are more likely than any other type of offender to reoffend for another sexual offense the town desires to impose safety precautions in furthering the public purpose of protecting these groups the purpose of this bylaw is to mitigate the potential risk of harm to children and the elderly of the lancaster community by deterring the ability for registered sex offenders to be in contact with unsuspecting individuals in locations that are primarily utilized by such groups the

determines that land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn have led to increased flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition and decreased groundwater recharge 1 as the area of house and building roofs parking lots and road surfaces increase the rate of stormwater runoff from these surfaces increases along with the preponderance of greater flooding unregulated stormwater runoff from historic development has led to the flooding we see today 2 land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters 3 the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies groundwater resources recreation aquatic habitats fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters 4 these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural and nonstructural best management practices 5 localities in the commonwealth of massachusetts are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution 6 the united states environmental protection agency has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff 7 a therefore the town of lancaster has established this stormwater management bylaw to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation b  1701 general provisions  1701   1702 purpose of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation this bylaw regulates the postconstruction stormwater controls for both new and redevelopment projects the purpose of the bylaw is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff flooding and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment and to comply with phase ii npdes stormwater requirements it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize flood damage to the public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public protect water and aquatic resources and promote groundwater recharge to protect surface and groundwater drinking supplies a the objectives of this bylaw are establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  1 require that new development redevelopment and all land conversion activities result in afterdevelopment runoff characteristics that are equal to or less than the predevelopment runoff characteristics in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion siltation nonpoint source pollution property damage and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  2 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  establish minimum design criteria for the protection of properties and aquatic resources downstream from land development and land conversion activities from damages due to increases in volume velocity frequency duration and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff  and establish minimum design criteria for measures to minimize nonpoint source pollution from stormwater runoff which would otherwise degrade water quality  3 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  4 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management measures and better site design practices or lowimpact 5 b  1701 lancaster code  1702   1703 definitions the definitions contained herein apply to issuance of a stormwater management permit smp established by the

zones are presumed significant to the protection of wetland resources and interests because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or other resources either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operations or maintenance of such activities such adverse impacts from construction and use include without limitation erosion siltation loss of groundwater recharge degradation of water quality and loss of wildlife habitat a vernal pools are presumed to provide essential breeding and rearing habitat functions which in the case of any seasonal wetland may not been certified as a vernal pool by the state it may be that the depression or area does not provide the habitat functions specified for identification of noncertified vernal pools b notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary the alteration of any residential business or institutional building or customary appurtenance thereto such as lawns gardens landscaped or other developed areas where such structure or appurtenance existed prior to the effective date of this

performance standards or other requirements set forth in its regulations provided that the commission finds in writing after said public hearing that there are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that would allow the proposed activity to proceed in compliance with said regulations  1 that avoidance minimization and mitigation has been employed to the maximum extent feasible  and 2 that the waiver is necessary to accommodate an overriding public interest or to avoid a decision that so restricts the use of the property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation 3 d in reviewing activities within the onehundredfoot buffer zone to a wetland and the twentyfivefoot nobuild or noalteration zone the commission shall presume these areas are important to the protection of other resource areas because activities undertaken in close proximity have a high likelihood of adverse impact either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities these adverse impacts from construction and use can include without limitation a erosion  1 e  2156 lancaster code  2156  b siltation  c contamination  d loss of groundwater recharge  e poor water quality  and f loss of wildlife habitat the commission may establish in its regulations design specifications performance standards other measures and

or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by the bylaw 2 in reviewing activities within the twohundredfoot buffer zone to a riverfront the commission shall presume the riverfront area is important to all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise and no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this bylaw has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that 1 there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this bylaw the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use the overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs f to prevent resource area loss the commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible to minimize alteration and where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized to provide full mitigation the commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation but only with specific plans professional design proper safeguards adequate security and professional monitoring and reporting to assure success because of the poor performance of earlier replication technologies g the commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area to be paid for by the applicant whenever it deems appropriate regardless the type of resource area or the amount or type of alteration proposed the decision shall be based upon the commissions estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering but not limited to such factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife importance of wildlife corridors in the area or actual or possible presence of rare plant or animal species in the area the work shall be performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications h  2156 general provisions  2156  set out in the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 the commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of vernal pools including the adjacent wetland buffer zone and twentyfive foot nobuild or noalteration zones perform essential habitat functions this presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which in the judgment of the commission demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential habitat functions any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 the commission holds the right to
