apply only to the exteriors of buildings and to areas of lots visible from public rightsofway b the public facades  front and street related elevations  of proposals for new buildings shall be more carefully reviewed than other facades c since construction in a historic district has usually taken place continuously from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century a variety of building types and styles result which demonstrate the changes in building tastes and technology over the years new buildings should continue this tradition while complementing and being compatible with other buildings in the area d reconstruction may be appropriate when it reproduces facades of a building which no longer exists and which was located in the historic district if the building would have contributed to the historical and architectural character of the area  if it will be compatible in terms of style height scale massing and material with the buildings immediately surrounding the lot on which the reproduction will be built  and if it is accurately based on pictorial documentation e because new buildings usually relate to an established pattern and rhythm of existing buildings other on the same and opposite sides of a street the dominance of that pattern and rhythm must be respected and not disrupted f new construction should be consistent with existing buildings along a

be visually incompatible b demolition is appropriate if i a building has lost its architectural and historical integrity and importance and its removal will not result in a more negative less appropriate visual effect on the district  ii a building does not contribute to the historical or architectural character and importance of the district and its removal will result in a more positive appropriate visual effect on the district  or iii the denial of the demolition will result in an economic hardship on the applicant as determined by the clarksdale preservation commission w relocation 1 definition the moving of a building in a district from one site to another 2 general principles a the moving of an existing building which retains architectural and historical integrity and which contributes to the architectural and historical character of the district should be avoided b the moving out of the district of a building which does not contribute to the historical and architectural integrity of the district or which has lost architectural integrity due to deterioration and neglect shall be appropriate if its removal or the proposal for its replacement will result in a more positive appropriate visual effect on the district 3 guidelines for relocation a relocated buildings must be carefully rebuilt to retain and maintain original architectural details and materials b a building may be moved into the district if it maintains a sense of architectural unity in terms of style height scale massing materials texture and setback with existing buildings along the street c a building may be moved from one site to another in the district if i the integrity of location and setting the building in its original location has been lost or is seriously threatened  ii the new location will be similar in setting and siting  iii the building will be compatible with the buildings adjacent to the new location in style height scale materials and setbacks  and iv the relocation of the building will not result in a negative visual effect on the site and surrounding building from which it will be removed x exceptions when the strict application of these design guidelines would result in severe hardship or injustice the preservation commission may vary these guidelines so that a rehabilitation project may be conducted in a reasonable manner but so that at the same time

of mayor and commissioners recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in this section may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirable be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in this section the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth 2 without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth herein when it finds that a a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  b a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade 3 whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in this section it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation 4 if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by this section for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements   parking space dimensions 1 each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least 19 feet long and 9 feet wide lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section  2 in parking areas containing 10 or more parking spaces up to 20 percent of the parking spaces need contain a rectangular area of only 72 feet in width by 15 feet in length if such spaces are provided they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only  3 wherever parking areas consist of spaces set

zoned property prior to the issuance of a building permit a screening barrier will be erected by the developer of the commercial industrial multifamily or manufactured home property which separates the adjoining yard and adequately screens the residential uses from any noise sight sound odor or other noxious offense which might be related by the commercial industrial multifamily or manufactured home property use   descriptions of screening the following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for screening requirements 1 type a opaque screening a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least 6 feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 16 feet the screening intended to include all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of special separation 2 type b semiopaque screening a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of six feet within intermittent visual obstructions from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 16 feet the semi opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces 3 type c broken screen a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of 16 feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces   subdivisions when undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold the subdivider shall not be required to install any screening screening shall be required if at all only when the lots are developed and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the

development for purposes of this section a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground 2 the retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or more unreasonably burdens a development the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer 3 if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements and as a result the parking requirements set forth cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the up to a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces   shade trees in parking areas 1 vehicle accommodation areas must be shaded by deciduous trees either retained or planted by the developer that have or will have when
