implementation  exemptions allowing singleuse bags  enforcement  violations  severability  effective date  no conflict with federal or state law  preemption  purpose and findings a it is the intent of the city of capitola in enacting this chapter to eliminate the common use of plastic singleuse carryout bags encourage the use of reusable bags by consumers and retailers and to reduce the consumption of singleuse bags in general b whereas the city of capitola has an obligation to protect the environment the economy and public health the city of capitola has a seventyfive percent waste reduction goal which is to be reached by waste reduction reuse recycling and composting the city of capitola makes the following findings 1 the department of resources recycling and recovery calrecycle estimates that californians use nearly twenty billion singleuse plastic bags per year and discard over one hundred plastic bags per second further the environmental protection agency estimates that only five percent of the plastic bags in california and nationwide are currently recycled 2 according to save our shores a santa cruz based marine conservation nonprofit that conducts beach river and inland cleanups in the coastal regions of santa cruz san mateo and monterey counties from june 2007 to may 201 over four hundred cleanups were conducted where volunteers removed a total of twentysix thousand plastic bags unchecked this material would have likely entered the marine environment of the monterey bay national marine sanctuary 3 plastic bags returned to supermarkets may be recycled into plastic lumber  however a very low percentage of bags are actually returned recycling bags into lumber does not reduce the impact of making new plastic carryout bags the calrecycle 2009 statewide recycling rate for plastic carryout bags report indicates that of the fiftytwo thousand seven hundred sixtyfive tons of regulated bags purchased statewide only one thousand five hundred twenty tons were collected for recycling a recycling rate of about three percent 4 the city of capitola currently has a plastic bag recycling component to the residential curbside recycling program 5 improperly prepared plastic bags create equipment problems at the material recovery facility loose bags wrap around the bearings and shafts of the material separator the equipment must be stopped and the bags removed before they cause permanent damage this results in slower production times for the sorting crew as well as increased processing and repair costs 6 compostable plastic carryout bags as currently manufactured do not solve the problems of wildlife damage litter or resource use addressed by this chapter compostable carryout bags are designed to remain intact until placed in a professional compost facility so they do not degrade quickly as litter or in a marine environment producing compostable bags consumes nearly as much fossil fuel as noncompostable bags mixing compostable bags with regular plastic bags prevents recycling or composting either of them therefore there is no exemption in this chapter for compostable carryout bags 7 reusable bags are readily available from numerous sources and vendors many grocery and other retail establishments throughout the city of capitola already offer reusable bags for sale at a price as low as one dollar 8 even though paper bags are recycled at a much higher rate within the city of capitola than plastic bags the purpose of this chapter is to reduce all singleuse bags for this reason a charge on paper bags is indicated as an incentive to reduce their use and encourage reusable bags 9 paper bags that contain a minimum of forty percent postconsumer recycled content have fewer negative impacts than virgin paper bags paper shopping bags with forty percent postconsumer recycled content are easily available and such bags are in wide use by capitola merchants 10 many california cities have adopted or are pursuing a ban as the most effective means to eliminate the impacts these plastic bags cause state law does not prohibit jurisdictions from placing fees on plastic or paper bags  part 2014   2013

trees height  b onefourth or not more than twentyfive percent of the volume of its foliage and branches  c within environmentally sensitive habitat areas as described in environmental sensitive habitats all degrees of pruning shall be defined as cutting and shall require a permit 2 the foregoing measurements are based on the largest size ever obtained by the existing tree if that size cannot be precisely determined then the community development directors best estimate of largest size shall be utilized in the later case the community development director would utilize average tree size information from standard landscape books such as the sunset book and take into consideration local soil and other circumstances to make the final decision 3 pruning of trees should be done only as needed but not more often than every two years to ensure pruning is not causing a hardship for the tree c toppingheading cuts prohibited topping heading cuts to public and private trees is prohibited toppingheading cuts are often done to reduce a trees size by shortening of limbs or branches back to a predetermined crown limit it can result in indiscriminate cutting back of major limbs to stubs or to lateral branches that are not large enough to assume the terminalleader role it weakens the tree structure causes inappropriate and rapid growth and may result in reduced vigor disease decay decline or sudden death of the tree 1 alternative to toppingheading there are times when a tree must be reduced in height or spread pruning methods approved by the international society of arboriculture such as crown reduction is recommended in these instances crown reduction is the selective removal or reduction of major limbs to proper lateral branches to decrease height and spread thinning cuts dropcrotch pruning and end weight reduction are used to reduce the length and weight on the ends of branches these pruning methods result in healthier more natural appearing trees where new branches will not be hanging and attached only to the outside of the tree trunk but will structurally grow from the tree itself 2 providing clearance for utility lines there are recommended techniques for line clearance by the isa such as directional pruning this method includes the removal of branches with proper cuts to direct the growth of the crown and limbs away from and around conductors if a branch must be shortened it should be cut back to a significant lateral that is large enough to assume the terminal role or the leader role a rule of thumb for this is to cut back to a lateral that is at least onethird the diameter of the limb being removed so the lateral can take over the structural role of the central or lateral leader for more information refer to brochures from the international society of arboriculture available at the community development department d permit  public utility or agency any person doing business as a public utility subject to the

and whether such structures contain a basement  exh c part 2018  variance procedure revised 618 the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of capitola to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  exh c part 2018  conditions for variances revised 618 a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  provided that the procedures of been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of capitola need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of capitola believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the santa cruz county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  exh c part 2018  approval of variances revised 618 a in passing upon requests for variances the city of capitola shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility

city to meet its regional fair share allotment of such units and to implement the policies and goals of the housing element of the citys general plan b these regulations are intended to encourage the development of affordable housing units by assisting both the public and private sector in making the provision of these units economically viable while providing assurances to the city that these units will maintain a high degree of quality and will remain affordable to the target population over a reasonable duration of time c these regulations are further intended to encourage the provision of affordable housing combination of the aho district with multiplefamily residential zoning districts within the city where the affordable housing projects are determined to be feasible and are consistent with the citys general plan d the affordable housing overlay provides a density increase for affordable housing development that in most cases exceeds density bonuses permitted by state law government  consequently a development may utilize the affordable housing overlay as an alternative to the use of state density bonus but may not utilize both the affordable housing overlay and state density bonuses e the affordable housing overlay is intended to provide a means of directing and simplifying the process for creating and maintaining affordable housing f the affordable housing overlay is also intended to provide incentives to developers whether in new or rehabilitated housing to maintain rental units for the long term eg not less than fiftyfive years and affordable

state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of capitola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  2012  findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the city of capitola are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses  2012  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  2012  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  2012  abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail  2012  interpretation in the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be a considered as minimum requirements  b liberally construed in favor of the governing body  and c deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes  2012  warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of capitola any officer or employee thereof the state of california or the federal emergency management agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder  2012  severability this chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be

modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of capitola to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2012  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of capitola need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of capitola believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the santa cruz county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  2012  approval of variances a in passing upon requests for variances the city of capitola shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a b and d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city of capitola may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  2012  nonconforming structures in floodplain a structure which was lawful before enactment of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued as a nonconforming structure subject to the following condition if any nonconforming

person or circumstance is held invalid the remainder of the chapter including the application of such part or provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable part 1993 prohibition of offshore oil development support facilities purpose  findings  implementation  zoning changes  effect of adoption  severability  purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to prevent the city of capitola from becoming a logistical base for offshore oil drilling l part 1987  findings the city has long opposed efforts to open the central california coast to offshore drilling onshore support of offshore oil drilling would be detrimental to the economy and environment of the city the city is a tourist attraction and thus its resources and beauty are shared with people from all over the united states if offshore drilling were to commence with onshore facilities located within the city much of the resources and beauty that is shared with the people of our great nation would be lost a effect on economy the city is partly dependent upon retail and visitor serving trades a recent study by economic research associates of san francisco found that the beaches in the greater santa cruz area were the main attraction for eighty percent of all visitors the us department of interiors fiveyear impact statement states conservatively that there is a forty percent chance of two oil spills in this area of one thousand barrel magnitude and ocean currents would bring oil to capitola beaches which would therefore have significant economic consequences for the city b oil spills the technology does not exist to contain or clean up an oil slick on the water oil is likely to land on capitola beaches as stated in the above report requiring massive cleanup efforts which would include a large expenditure of city funds and staff time and volunteer time from city residents c endangered or threatened species there are at least twentysix endangered or threatened species that reside on the central california coast including the southern sea otter oil spills routine discharges or toxic byproducts air pollution and noise impacts will pose a danger to these species d infrastructure the city does not have the infrastructure available to handle increased traffic especially large trucks associated with onshore facilities traffic is already a problem e ambience of the village there is significant historical educational and economic value to the capitola village recently utilities were undergrounded to help preserve the charm of the village offshore drilling and onshore facilities associated with it would dramatically alter the nature and ambience of the village thereby causing significant effects on the city f space availability in the city there is a relatively small amount of space available with the city approximately two and onehalf square miles among these parcels are the rispin mansion and others which are inappropriate for onshore facilities and cannot be adapted for onshore facilities without ruining them g the federal government has proposed to open up virtually the entire california coastline to offshore oil and gas exploration and development including the coastline off of santa cruz county h coastal areas off central california have been determined high priority areas for offshore oil and gas exploration and development by various multinational oil companies i offshore oil and gas development off the coast of capitola would have the following significant effects upon the city j if offshore oil and gas development occurs off the capitola coast significant new air pollution is inevitable one drill ship produces approximately the same amount of air pollution as twentythree thousand cars driving fifty miles per day despite this fact the federal government does not presently require that offshore oil and gas developments comply with state and local air pollution k offshore oil and gas development off the capitola coast would inevitably result in the discharge of large volumes of highly toxic drilling muds into the ocean floor these toxic materials would degrade the sensitive marine environment put all forms of marine life at greater risk and pose a threat to human beings who may later eat the fish contaminated with accumulated toxic material l offshore oil and gas development off the capitola coast would put the existing local economy in jeopardy because such development would significantly and substantially interfere with the operation of the local fishing industry m noisy helicopter traffic would become a significant irritant to capitola residents n the coastal zone is subject to earthquake hazards geologic and historic records indicate that earthquakes have and will occur in this area an earthquake could be accompanied by a surface rupture ground shaking and ground failure the location of oil and gas support facilities in this geologically unstable area would well result in an environmental disaster 1 rather than consuming offshore oil and gas resources now our nation should conserve these resources since they are nonrenewable moreover the accelerated production and expenditure of hydrocarbon fuels aggravates the global warming trend a trend which may have long term adverse impacts on capitola and in particular on coastal communities which could be subject to an inundation if global oceans continue to rise as a result of polar icecap melting our nation should develop a national energy strategy based on energy conservation emphasizing the increasing use of renewable energy sources such as geothermal production and reinjection instead the federal government has presently reduced or eliminated efforts to increase energy conservation and to develop renewable energy sources at the same time that it is attempting to increase the development of nonrenewable energy sources like offshore oil and gas the citizens of capitola are willing and able to do their part in conserving energy and in developing a society less dependent on nonrenewable fossil fuel resources l part 1987  implementation there shall be no construction reconstruction operation or maintenance of any commercial or industrial facility within the city including but not limited to oil or gas storage facilities pipe and drilling materials or equipment repair or storage facilities which operates directly in support of any offshore oil or gas exploration development drilling pumping or production  nor shall there be any construction reconstruction or operation of facilities to process any oil or natural gas taken or removed from any offshore oil or gas drilling or pumping operations  1987  zoning changes the city council in adopting this chapter suggests that a this chapter shall not be amended nor repealed without a vote of the people b no zoning changes to accommodate onshore support facilities for offshore oil or gas exploration development drilling or pumping or production shall be enacted without a vote of the people of the city of capitola  1987  effect of adoption adoption of

provision of affordable housing in the city of capitola the city council finds a a decent home and suitable living environment for all capitola residents and workers is a priority of the highest order to this end the housing element of the capitola general plan discusses and analyzes the need to provide housing for senior citizens disabled persons single parent families homeless persons and homeless families and families of very low low and moderate income levels similarly the general plan housing element outlines the extremely high cost of housing both regionally and within the city with respect to affordable housing in the city the housing element articulates among others policies 34 35 and 36 intended to advance the general plan goal to encourage new affordable housing opportunities through construction of new units these policies encourage the adoption of an inclusionary housing ordinance which provides for construction of affordable housing units in connection with private market rate residential development or the payment of in lieu affordable housing fees in connection with market rate residential development and further encourage the establishment of a housing trust fund to be used to facilitate the development of new affordable housing in the city b in addition state law including but not limited to the california redevelopment law and state housing law articulate policies and goals and impose legal obligations upon california cities counties and redevelopment agencies relative to the creation and provision of affordable housing by communities throughout the state including the city of capitola accordingly a paramount goal of the city and the redevelopment agency is to provide and to create a regulatory environment conducive to the development of both rental and forsale housing available to all economic sectors of the community with priority given to very low low and moderate income households currently residing or working within the city c there is currently an inadequate supply of housing in the city which is affordable to very low low and moderate income households federal and state financial assistance and subsidy programs are not sufficient in themselves to close the gap between the cost of most housing in the city and the ability of very low low and moderate income households to pay those housing costs d the city given current zoning regulations and very limited vacant residentially zoned property is nearly built out for purposes of future residential development within the city the inventory of land available for residential development in the city is at a premium and the inventory of land which can be used for the development of housing for very low low and moderate income households becomes even more depleted with the development andor improvement of each market rate housing unit in the city accordingly housing opportunities for very low low and moderate income households are diminished incrementally with the development of each new market rate housing unit which is constructed rebuilt or substantially improved in the city singlefamily homes which are rebuilt and residential remodeladditions which increase square footage more than fifty percent affect the supply of affordable housing in the city when new larger units replace older smaller units many of the replaced older units were rentals or were more accessible to be purchased by moderate income households e according to published multiple listing service home sales price statistics over the last nine years from 1996 to july 2004 the median countywide price of a forsale singlefamily house has increased from two hundred forty thousand three hundred and fifty dollars to six hundred thirty five thousand dollars the median countywide price for a forsale townhousecondominium has increased from one hundred sixtyfour thousand five hundred dollars to four hundred twenty five thousand dollars over the same period according to the capitolas adopted housing element in 2004 the maximum affordable sales price for a moderate income threeperson household was two hundred fifty two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars the maximum affordable sales price for a moderate income fourperson household was two hundred eighty thousand two hundred and fifty dollars these figures demonstrate that the affordability gap herein referenced has increased incrementally over this nineyear period thereby rendering affordable housing programssubsidies currently in place increasingly ineffective in achieving their objectives to house very low low and moderate income households in the city f if very low low and moderate income workers cannot find housing in the city employers will have difficulty in securing a labor force and employees will be forced to commute automobile commuting increases air pollution unnecessarily creates traffic congestion and develops a population which is separate and distinct from fulltime residents thereby resulting in diverse and often contrasting demands on limited city resources g residential housing projects which contribute to the citys very low low and moderate income housing stock serve to augment the citys housing mix increase the supply of housing for all economic sectors of the community and thereby assist in providing for a balanced community which is deemed to be in the public interest h increasing the supply of housing affordable to very low low and moderate income families assistance and cooperation of private residential developers can be achieved only if the provision of such housing by private residential developers becomes more feasible it is therefore necessary to provide flexibility in the manner and method by which private residential development contributes its fair share to the citys affordable housing stock i affordable housing is best integrated into the community when that housing is distributed throughout all areas of the city rather than concentrated in a single area j therefore in order to advance and achieve the affordable housing goals and policies of the city redevelopment agency and state referenced in this section adoption of the affordable housing regulations prescribed in this chapter is necessary and will serve to advance and protect the general health and welfare of the citys residents workers and economy  2004
