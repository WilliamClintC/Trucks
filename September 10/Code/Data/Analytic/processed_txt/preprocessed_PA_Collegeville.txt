clean water act 33 usc  1251 et seq and the general pretreatment regulations 40 cfr 403 the objectives of this article are 1 to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw and wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge  2 to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw and wastewater system which will passsystem inadequately treated into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system  3 to protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public  4 to promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewaters and sludges from the system  5 to provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation maintenance and improvement of the potw and wastewater system  and 6 to enable the lower perkiomen valley regional sewer authority as control authority to comply

5802 of this chapter designed to a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and

other zoning requirements as an overlay certain restrictions for steep slope areas to promote the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the borough of collegeville b to prevent inappropriate development of steep slope areas in order to avoid potential dangers for human usage caused by erosion stream siltation soil failure leading to structural collapse or damage andor unsanitary conditions and associated hazards c to minimize danger to public health and safety by promoting safe and sanitary drainage d to permit only those uses that are compatible with development of steep slope areas in order to avoid accelerated erosion soil failure accelerated seepage or other conditions which may create a danger to life andor property e to permit only those uses in steep slope areas that are compatible with the preservation of existing natural features including vegetative cover by restricting the grade of steep slope areas f to promote the ecological balance among those natural system elements such as wildlife vegetation and aquatic life that could be adversely affected by inappropriate development of steep slope areas g to prevent development that would cause excessive erosion and siltation and a resultant reduction in the watercarrying capacity of the watercourses which flow around the borough with the consequences of increased flood crests and flood hazards within the borough and to both upriver and downriver municipalities h to prevent landowners in the borough andor other municipalities from the possible harmful effects of inappropriate grading and development on steep slope areas i to protect the entire borough from inappropriate development on steep slope areas which could have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works and
