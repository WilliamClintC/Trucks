of at least thirty 30 singlefamily residential dwelling units or potential subscriber units per mile or prorated portion thereof as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest technically feasible point on the grantees existing cable system to the end of the proposed line extension the extension of the distribution system excluding drops shall be completed at grantees cost within ninety 90 days after the requirements of this section become operative and all necessary permits are obtained provided that i each such residential unit is or is anticipated to be located within a distance of no more than one hundred fifty 150 feet from the anticipated location of such extension or each such residential unit which is in excess of one hundred fifty 150 feet from the anticipated location of such extension agrees to pay and does in fact pay the actual cost of that portion of the extension in excess of one hundred fifty 150 feet ii the grantee is able to secure all necessary easements or rightsofway for purposes of locating its system in the area of such extension including the location of all trunk distribution and drop cables on reasonable terms and conditions after good faith efforts to do so iii each such residential unit is in existence or is anticipated to be constructed within six 6 months from the date of such extension provided that the grantee will place conduit in open trench where it exists and where construction will be completed in a period estimated to be longer than six 6 months but less than twentyfour 24 months where the area of such extension has been platted with at least thirty 30 singlefamily residential dwelling units per mile or prorated portion thereof as measured in linear trench footage from the nearest technically feasible point of the grantees activated coaxial distribution system to the end of the proposed line extension 2 a multiple dwelling unit shall be considered in establishing the minimum density required for a mandatory line extension where the owner of such multiple dwelling unit has agreed to enter into a service contract with the grantee for the units of such complex or has otherwise requested that cable service be furnished directly to the owners or occupants of the units within such complex and in either such instance such complex satisfies each of the criteria for extension set forth in this section including without limitation the grantee securing all necessary easements or rightsofway to such complex as well as within such complex for purposes of constructing its system where such a cable service contract has been arranged consistent with the requirements of this section and cable service is to be provided directly to and all charges for such cable service are the responsibility of the occupants or owners of individual dwelling units within multidwelling unit buildings or the owner of the multidwelling unit buildings such units will be counted separately for purposes of mandatory line extension  where cable service is to be provided indirectly to such occupants billing services or other discounted rates units will be counted based on their equivalency to regular rate paying units eg if the grantee receives onehalf  the normal service charge for twenty 20 units in a multiple dwelling unit complex this will be deemed to be the equivalent of ten 10 full paying units and they will only be counted as ten 10 units for purposes of this determination extension of cable service to any multiple dwelling unit does not require grantee to wire the multiple dwelling unit at its cost and expense but rather only to extend such service up to such multiple dwelling unit complex in the public rightofway in closest proximity to such complex 3 in areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of cable service grantee shall provide upon the request of one or more potential subscribers desiring cable service an estimate of the costs required

required for mandatory extension such payment shall be treated as consideration for early extension 4 nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent grantee from serving areas not covered under
