uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other minor drainage

located within a protective area except those areas exempted pursuant to subsection d5d of this section c requirements the following requirements shall be met 1 impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or to the maximum extent practicable if there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area the stormwater management plan shall contain a written sitespecific explanation 2 where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area adequate sod or selfsustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained where no impervious surface is present the adequate sod or selfsustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions nonvegetative materials such as rock riprap may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur note to permittees it is recommended that seeding of noninvasive vegetative cover be used in the protective areas some invasive plants that should not be used are listed in wis admin nr 40 flood and droughttolerant vegetation that can provide longterm bank stability because of an extensive root system is preferable vegetative cover may be measured using the line transect method described in the university of wisconsin extension publication number a3533 titled estimating residue using the line transect method 3 bmps such as filter strips swales or wet detention ponds that are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the protective area note to permittees other laws such as wis stats ch 30 and wis

the requirements of local ordinance requirements for peak flow control total suspended solids control and infiltration if the swales are designed to do all of the following or to the maximum extent practicable 1 swales shall be vegetated however where appropriate nonvegetative measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams note to permittees it is preferred that tall and dense vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its greater effectiveness at enhancing runoff pollutant removal 2 swales shall comply with sections vf velocity and depth and vg swale geometry criteria with a swale treatment length as long as that specified in section vc pretreatment of the state department of natural resources technical
