guidelines and policy statement design guidelines and policy statement new constr new constructionuction a general the design of new construction is of utmost importance whether it must harmonize with the character of the neighborhood and existing structures or if it begins the new development of raw land the following guidelines and policy statement are not intended to require particular architectural styles or dictate one period over another instead they are purposely general in nature and are intended to allow a range of design options which will encourage development compatible with the neighboring properties and the town all new construction plans that come before the planning and zoning commission must have been completed by an architect andor engineer registered in the state of maryland this is in accordance with the state of maryland policy concerning building codes and commercial and public buildings it is not likely that the planning commission will handle any applications that fall under any other category since in this regard industrial would be considered commercial or public and multifamily residential the same if the building and site plans are boilerplate from another jurisdiction they can be deemed unresponsive to the general guidelines above in that they were designed totally without regard to their placement in the chestertown community the applicant can then be asked to have their architect redesign the structure to conform with local conditions and architecture conversely if the surrounding buildings were built without any regard to architectural design or to the community in general the applicant can be asked to follow good design standards for the future growth of the town the following factors should be taken into account when planning and designing new construction 1 compatibility with surrounding architecture the relationship between the width and height of the front faade of a building should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings additionally the relationship of a building to the open spaces between it and adjoining buildings should be visually compatible with the spacing of adjacent buildings this is not merely a discussion of the setbacks required by the applicable zoning when one moves past a sequence of buildings one experiences the proportion of the width to height of the buildings as well as a rhythm of recurrent building masses to the open spaces between them for example if a series of narrow two story buildings is interrupted by a new wide one story building of the same height as the other two story buildings the result is a very incompatible streetscape 2 height the height of a proposed building should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings one of the most distinguishing features of any neighborhood is the strong horizontal line established by the structures cornices it is important that this line be introduced into the design solution design manual    for new construction to assure continuity from one building to the next it is not necessary to duplicate an adjoining structure in terms of height but instead to maintain an appearance of a strong horizontal line between dwellings there should not be more than a ten percent 10% difference in a visual field where the majority of buildings are similar in height nor should there be a ten percent 10% difference in the height of any one story unless the adjacent structures are functionally too short if all the surrounding buildings are of varied height with no apparent compatibility the planning commission shall ultimately decide the appropriate scale based on the system of development of the rest of the town and on the requirements of the zoning ordinance 3 scale the size of a building the building mass in relationship to open spaces windows and doors should be compatible with other buildings in a visually related field scale is created by the size of units of construction and architectural detail which relate to the immediate environment and man 4 materials texture and color the purpose of this section is to encourage the proper use of appropriate materials and details the materials and details of new construction should relate to the materials and details of existing adjacent buildings relationship of materials texture and color of the faade of a building should be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is visually related however materials for all structures in commercial industrial and public zones shall be of stone or masonry to ensure the safety of the occupants visible roofing materials may be slate composition shingles or metal with a permanent finish and not the type used for barns or sheds further metal buildings have no precedence in chestertowns history  therefore the use of metal is not permitted on visible facades traditional neig traditional neighborhood developmenthborhood development traditional neighborhood development tnd utilizes design principles embodied in urban form and design conventions that were the norm in chestertown from colonial times to the 1940s the tnd district permits development and land use pursuant to an approved master development plan that meets the requirements of the town zoning that is approved by the planning commission the following design guidelines are intended to supplement the design standards and requirements contained in the chestertown zoning to the r6 traditional neighborhood development district design manual    applicants shall be guided throughout the review process by the following tnd design standards because it is recognized that design professionals including architects landscape architects and land planners are trained to strive for creative excellence the design standards and criteria are not intended to restrict creative solutions or to dictate all design details the tnd design guidelines serve as a tool for the town planning staff by providing a checklist of elements to be considered the standards also inform the design professionals of items that should be considered or included from the outset of the design process a purpose and intent the purpose and intent of establishing design guidelines for the traditional neighborhood development tnd district is 1 to preserve and enhance the unique character of the town while integrating new development into the overall fabric of the community  2 to encourage creative design and innovative approaches to achieve the community character called for in the towns comprehensive plan  3 to ensure that each incremental addition to the town recognizes precedent and is designed in a manner that is mindful of what has come before and contributes to the achievement of overall community design objectives  and 4 to encourage a broad housing market that will accommodate a diverse population mix of all ages income levels and socioeconomic backgrounds reflective of the towns existing demographics b specific goals and objectives the goals and objectives of the tnd design guidelines are to 1 design for the human scale and perceptions to create a sense of neighborhood and community 2 enhance chestertowns sense of place in its rural and regional setting by maintaining the smalltown feel while keeping new development in harmony with nature 3 create a pleasant and functional pedestrian realm that consists of common open spaces treelined streets and landscaped areas between public and private spaces and utility corridors 4 encourage internal and peripheral open space 5 create neighborhood centers within walking distances of all surrounding neighborhoods 6 create appropriate transition areas between neighborhoods design manual    7 design for neighborhood and collector streets internal to the community 8 integrate buildings of smaller scale in a pattern of various footprints 9 plan for mixed and multiple land uses including a mix of housing types income and a horizontal and vertical mix of uses 10 utilize appropriate details in building design 11 create housing which offers a variety of options to accommodate and encourage a diverse population mix of varied socioeconomic backgrounds reflective of the towns demographics c applicability the provisions of the tnd design guidelines shall be considered during the review of all master development plans site plans subdivision plans or other permits or applications for new development new construction involving structural alterations and new structures on all land located in the r6 tnd district where these guidelines conflict with any provision of the chestertown zoning the subdivision regulations the provisions of the zoning subdivision regulations shall control d design provisions the planning commission will rely on the comprehensive plan and the design guidelines concerning issues of design neighborhood and community character and compatibility in general these call for the following characteristics which shall be set forth on a set of drawings plans andor elevations sufficient to permit the planning commission to apply the following standards e general design provisions the following standards generally apply to development proposed in the tnd district 1 architectural considerations a the architectural design of structures and their materials and colors should be visually harmonious with the overall appearance history and cultural heritage of the town with natural landforms and existing vegetation and with other development plans approved by the town b specific consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent properties where such projects demonstrate the towns character c facing buildings should not differ in height by more than  excluding church steeples decorative cornices chimneys and the like design manual    d materials should be used that have similar texture and appearance as appropriate to the towns character e exterior materials should be natural in appearance with preference given to wood or wood appearance siding stone and brick exterior building colors should be traditional or muted tones 2 overall form and spatial relationships a areas of new construction should be sited so as to best preserve natural vistas and the existing topography b peripheral greenbelt open space should be designed to follow natural features whenever possible and to maintain an agricultural woodland or countryside character c the developed portions of the tnd should be distinguished from the peripheral greenbelt open space by a welldefined line or edge so that developed areas will transition very quickly to rural undeveloped lands d peripheral open space should surround the planned neighborhood an exception to this standard is that neighborhood centers areas may be located along major roads at the planned neighborhood perimeter another exception is that planned neighborhoods proposed to be located within five hundred 500 feet of existing residential development should be encouraged to be contiguous with preexisting neighborhoods use of multiple street and footpath connections e residential lots should not be located within twohundred and fifty 250 feet of any twolane state highway unless effectively screened from the public view by virtue of topography dense vegetation or

the door  e distinctive roof forms  f arches outdoor patios  g display windows  or h integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas andor places for sitting c building groups 1 buildings should be arranged in a manner that creates a sense of enclosure and defined space a sites buildings should be arranged so that they help to frame and define the fronting streets as well as any internal streets of site giving deliberate form to streets and sidewalk areas 2 where possible it is recommended that buildings on the site be arranged so that a sufficient number of the sites buildings or portion of the sites aggregate building mass has an orientation towards the fronting arterials street and are located in relatively close relation to those fronting arterialsstreets so as to effectively frame and define the fronting streets and the pedestrian realm along those streets 3 new buildings within the c3 district should not be separated from fronting streets by large parking lots 4 at a minimum sensitive placement of buildings along the opposite sides of the street can be used to help define the streetscape and bring the two focus or support areas in closer relation to each other in such cases the buildings should also be located in close relation to the street and to each other and in a common alignment 5 all buildings should be in close physical proximity to the extent allowed by site topography wellconnected by pedestrian sidewalks walkways arcades or colonnades and not separated from one another by large parking areas one should not have to walk in and along parking aisles or roadways to get from any one building to another 6 buildings that do not occupy the street front should be designed so that they are oriented towards the fronting streets and have a relation and orientation with the rest of the development such buildings should also be connected to and served from internal drives 7 the design of buildings and sites should be integrated into the overall design of the proposed development all buildings should have architectural design and pedestrian connections strongly linking them with rest of the development for example covered pedestrian walkways linking buildings with the main commercial street front building could provide a strong design connection design manual    table of district regulations minimum lot requirements
