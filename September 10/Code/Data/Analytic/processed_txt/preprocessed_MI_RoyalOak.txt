reference a the city finds that synthetic marijuana consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana with that use having become increasingly popular particularly among teens and young adults b the city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers hospitals emergency room doctors and police agencies that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions tremors seizures hallucinations unconsciousness anxiety attacks dangerously elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them c the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process d the city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances that while not approved for human consumption are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which upon consumption may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana e based on these findings this article is adopted for the purpose and with the intent to protect the public health and safety of the city and its residents from the threat posed by the availability and use of synthetic marijuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in

variance the planning commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed signs as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter further in granting a variance the planning commission shall state the grounds upon which it justifies the granting of a variance as outlined below when granting any variance the planning commission must ensure that the spirit of this chapter is observed public safety secured and natural resources protected the planning commission shall determine that the variance approval either as proposed by the applicant or as otherwise determined by the planning commission based upon the record is the minimum relief necessary in order to achieve substantial justice 3 the applicant must present evidence to show that if this article is applied strictly unnecessary hardship andor practical difficulties to the applicant will result based upon the following criteria amended 6122017 by  a that the property could not reasonably accommodate a sign permitted at that specific location  b that the appeal results from exceptional and unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not from general neighborhood or citywide conditions including unique architectural character of the building or innovative techniques that are determined not to be detrimental to the building or the character of the area  c that the sign requested by the variance would not alter the essential character of the area  d that the alleged hardships and practical difficulties or both which will result from a failure to grant the variance include substantially more than mere inconvenience or monetary concern   60716 royal oak code  60716  e that the alleged hardship has not been created by the petitioner or any other person presently having an interest in the property  f that the variance would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the immediate vicinity that would be affected by granting the variance considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this chapter and the individual hardship that will be suffered by a failure of the planning commission to grant a variance  and g that a lesser relaxation than that requested would not give substantial relief to the owner of the property or be more consistent with justice to other property

safety and welfare of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets sidewalks and rightsofway are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks that newsracks are properly maintained and that newsracks do not create a visual blight in the city especially within downtown royal oak b in recent years the proliferation of newsracks on downtown streets and particularly poorly maintained or abandoned freestanding newsracks has contributed to the congestion of city sidewalks impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic interfered with the use of streets sidewalks and public rightsofway presented hazards to persons and property resulted in visual blight and hindered the ability of public services such as sidewalk and street cleaning certain newsracks have been placed in inappropriate locations have been abandoned are poorly maintained and have been used as trash receptacles causing unsightly and unsanitary clutter and litter c the city of royal oak has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities as identified in the city of royal oak master plan to that end and consistent with the downtown development authoritys

the negative effects of this problem d after conducting an extensive study and inquiry into this problem as documented in the downtown development authoritys wayfinding recommendations program

sidewalks or other public property or rightsofway be placed in and sold from modular units which are provided by the city at locations commensurate with the locations at which newspapers and other publications are currently being sold or provided e the purpose of this article is therefore to accomplish the following 1 provide for increased pedestrian and vehicular safety and convenience  2

the billboard is directed in the event that the billboard is situated upon two streets or roads having different levels the height of the billboard shall be measured from the higher street or road d surface area the surface display area of any side of a billboard may not exceed 300 square feet in the case of billboard structures with tandem or stacked billboard faces the combined surface display area of both faces may not exceed 300 square feet e electronic message 1 findings a it is recognized that billboards with changeable or continuous dynamic content are more distracting and less comprehensible than static images as they require more attention for longer periods of time to comprehend the intended message studies show that there is a direct correlation between electronic messages on billboards and the distraction of drivers which can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted by a changing message by waiting for the next change to occur on  77057 waterworks  77057  a sign and by messages that do not tell the full story in one look drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message of a billboard by messages on a sign that are too small to be clearly seen or by messages that contain more than a simple easily read message b despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages on billboards except as prohibited by state or federal law billboard owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain reasonable restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation near residential areas where billboards with electronic messages can adversely impact residential character c it is also recognized that billboards do not need to serve the same wayfinding function as do onpremises signs allowed under signs further billboards are allowed only within certain zoning districts billboards are in themselves distracting and their removal serves public safety a single electronic message can serve the function otherwise performed by multiple traditional billboards thus billboard owners ought to be encouraged to use electronic messages to consolidate such activities in appropriate locations while removing traditional billboards from areas where they are not appropriate d the standards within this subsection are therefore intended to provide incentives for the voluntary and uncompensated removal of billboards in certain settings their removal results in an overall advancement of one or more of the goals set forth in this chapter that should more than offset any additional burden caused by the incentives these provisions are also based on the recognition that the incentives create an opportunity to consolidate billboards that would otherwise remain distributed throughout the city e electronic messages should therefore be allowed on billboards but with significant and reasonable controls to minimize their proliferation and potential threats to public safety 2 regulations a billboard shall not contain any visible moving parts revolving parts or mechanical movement of any description or other apparent visible movement including intermittent electrical pulsation or by action of normal wind currents except for electronic messages subject to the following requirements and standards  77057 royal oak code  77057  a a single contiguous electronic message may be permitted on each billboard face electronic messages may occupy all of the actual copy and graphic area of a
