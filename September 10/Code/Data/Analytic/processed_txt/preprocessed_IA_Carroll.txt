citizens of the city and may have a serious detrimental impact on the quality of the environment  and 4the collection of solid waste within the city is an essential public service  and 5to better assure compliance with the requirements of chapters 455b301a  455b302  455b307  a  and 455d4 it is necessary for the city to assume the overall responsibility for the collection of all waste generated
