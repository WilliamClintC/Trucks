safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured therefore it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface these aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas b groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas therefore it is necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized c according to available data provided by the state department of natural resources the city contains significant groundwater recharge areas according to the state groundwater pollution susceptibility map the city is within an area having a low susceptibility rating drastic rating less than 141 2 5181999 objectives the objectives of this article are to

site should be made by a professional engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site the purpose of the dam the type of impoundment safety and maintenance requirements b for purposes of these regulations dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities normallydry basins ponds and lakes a normallydry basin is one designed to impound storm water runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event the vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass lakes and city of suwanee development regulations _________________________________________________________________  revision  ponds on the other hand are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a moreorless permanent basis lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude the magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam

maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre the term unit is an expression of basal area a standard forest inventory measurement and is not synonymous with tree this density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees or some combination of the two as represented by the formula sdf   edf + rdf where sdf site density factor   the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site 20 units per acre edf existing density factor   density of existing trees to be preserved on a site rdf replacement density factor   density of new trees to be planted on site  site density factor the sdf is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 20 example a 22 acre site has a sdf of 22 x 20   44  existing density factor 1998 zoning ordinance of the city of suwanee revision   the edf is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees

standards  introduction the following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the tree replacement intent of this replacement plans should be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the urban landscape every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material  planting specifications replacement tree proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standards on a property shall comply with the following a trees selected for planting must be free from injury pests disease nutritional disorders or root defects and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability the following criteria are generally used for the determination of vigor 1 foliage should have a green or dark green color vigorous trees will have large leaves and dense foliage when compared to trees with poor vigor 2 shoot growth for most vigorous trees will be at least one 1 foot per year one half or more of the foliate should be on the branches originating from the lower twothirds of the trunk and onehalf should originate from the upper third 3 bark texture can denote vigor smooth or shiny bark on the trunk and branches usually denotes good vigor conversely rough and full bark could indicate poor vigor 4 trunk taper the trunks of vigorous trees will generally have a decrease in trunk diameter with increasing height trees with reverse tapers or no taper should be avoided 5 root color young roots of most trees will be light in color 6 trees selected for planting must be free of root defects two types of root defects generally occur a kinked roots in which taproots major roots or both are bent more than 90 degrees with less than 20 percent of the root system originating above the kink a tree with such roots will probably bend at the soil line when released from a supporting stake b circling or girdling roots which circle 80 percent or more of the root system by 360 degrees or more a tree with such roots would ultimately have less than 20 percent of its system available for support b standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the international society of arboriculture publication tree and shrub transplanting 1998 zoning ordinance of the city of

specifications reference the manual of woody landscape plants michael dirr 198 castle books or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements c planting procedures 1 planting holes should be at least three times the diameter of the root ball 2 trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or container 3 spade compacted bottom and sides of the planting hole should be roughed or scarified to allow the penetration of developing roots 4 good water drainage from the bottom of the planting hole is essential for root regeneration 5 once the transplanted tree is set the hole should be backfilled with soil of good texture and structure traditionally backfill material is comprised of a mix of negative soil organic matter such as peat and inorganic material such as perlite or vermiculite in a  ratio there are indications that a backfill with native soil alone may be adequate 6 the addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury and is therefore not recommended if fertilizer must be added a low rate should be used approximately 15 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill is recommended for bare root plants and 25 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill for balled and burlapped trees 7 the backfill should be gently tamped but not compacted and soaked for settling 8 the soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling  a ridge or dike around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering  species the planning and inspections department shall maintain the following tree lists 1 recommended overstory tree list 2 recommended limited overstory tree list 3 recommended understory tree list 4 recommended limited understory tree list 5 recommended ornamental tree list 6 recommended evergreen

hedgerow shrubs planted to meet the requirements of this article shall be selected from one of the above lists maintained by the planning and inspections department each tree list shall include the scientific name common name anticipated canopy area suitability for parking lots suitability of use as a street tree and whether the tree is a native species or not the hedgerow list shall include the scientific name common name and anticipated height 1998 zoning ordinance of the city of suwanee revision   the planning and inspections department develops and maintains these lists of suitable overstory and understory tree species and hedgerow species that may be planted within the city of suwanee the tree and hedgerow lists shall be updated as new cultivars or new species are introduced as issues arise with current species such as diseases or pests and to ensure that trees are being planted that meet the purpose and intent of the ordinance  minimum root zones in order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved large trees  200 sq feet  of pervious root zone small trees  100 sq feet  of pervious root zone all planting strips  five 5 feet  minimum width  irrigation newly planted trees and existing trees subjected to construction impacts typically need supplemental watering when rainfall is inadequate applicants should be prepared to discuss how trees are to be watered during their establishment or transition period and possibly note on the plan the method of irrigation that is proposed specimen trees  identification some trees on a site warrant special consideration due to their species distinctive form appearance rarity historical significance age ecological value or other unique characteristic these trees are referred to as specimen trees as such these trees should be preserved the following criteria are used by the city of suwanee to identify specimen trees size appearance health and overall condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify size criteria  large hardwoods 24inch diameter or larger  large softwoods 24inch diameter or larger  small trees see definitions 12inch diameter or larger condition criteria  life expectancy of greater than 15 years  relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay  no more than one major and several minor

trees into the design of projects additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purposes credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two 2 times the assigned unit value shown in table 17002  removal and replacement if a specimen tree is to be removed a plan or written documentation from a qualified expert certified arborist or registered forester indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to and approved by the city specimen trees must be replaced by species with potentials for comparable size and quality trees intended to replace a specimen may not be any smaller than 3 caliper dbh any specimen tree which is removed must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to two 2 times the unit value of the tree removed size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of this condition
