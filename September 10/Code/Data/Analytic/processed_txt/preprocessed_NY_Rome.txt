which contain mixedincome families economic and cultural diversity sound physical structures a clean and attractive environment and a wellmaintained infrastructure the service sector including retail sales professional technical and financial services have overtaken manufacturing as the core of new york states regional economy commercial globalization has meant that many rome businesses may expand their trade from local and regional to national and international clients the comprehensive master plan includes three components 1 a community profile 2 an action plan and 3 an updated city zoning ordinance which can be found at  the action plan identified tax base enhancement development of a stronger commercial center and an expansion of commercial and retail uses in general downtown

provided observations recommendations and target areas for business development in romes downtown commercial corridors at the same time rome was designated one of 12 state pilot quality communities using $7500000 in quality communities program funding rome received technical assistance from the main street center to initiate a main streets program complete with a board of directors and a paid coordinator the main streets program offers a strategy for downtown renewal focusing on four main points to create sustainable urban development design  organization  promotion  economic restructuring the approachs selfhelp process involves building partnerships and utilizing existing assets to institute effective change the rome ez empire zone focuses on the economic restructuring component of this strategy and encompasses much of the downtown commercial corridors designated under the main streets program the trusts national main streets program which is found at  encompasses a fourpoint approach for development with local committees in 1 organization 2 promotion 3 design and 4 economic restructuring according to the main streets center a citys central business district often accounts

development design  organization  promotion  economic restructuring the approachs selfhelp process involves building partnerships and utilizing existing assets to institute effective change ridc will use empire zone programs to focus on the economic restructuring component of this strategy and offer reduced investment thresholds to stimulate business development in the downtown commercial corridors contained within the rome ez empire zone city urban design plan and downtown design guidelines 2002 during 2005200 the city partnered with the new york state department of transportation and

consulting 1997 this study remains the cornerstone of mohawk valley edges economic development growth enterprises corporation economic development plan for oneida and herkimer county this document cited the importance of the city in assisting targeted businesses to locate at the gbtp and recommended concurrent development actions in the following six targeted areas  growing area businesses   nurturing hightech for the future   education and labor force development   business attraction   tourism and the arts the financial incentives offered by the rome empire zone are critical components of these development strategies and help encourage commercial development and revitalization of economically depressed historic business districts as well as the traditional industrial and commercial growth centers at the wrip and the gbtp romes empire zone conforms to criteria contained in general municipal law  958 ll no 1 of 2007 i 11007 goals and strategies within the city ridc undertakes many of the same economic development issues that mohawk valley edge oversees and coordinates in oneida and herkimer counties ridc however not only assists manufacturers but also service professional and retail firms within the city in light of these realities the economic development goals of the rome empire zone are goal #1 revitalize aging andor vacant industrialmanufacturing sites with new light

assistance programs offered by but not limited to the city the rome main streets alliance working solutions mohawk valley community college mvcc ridc and the oneida county industrial development agency ocida further enhance the incentive package specific qualifications for these programs are often unique but the geographical boundaries of the rome ez have been revised to ensure maximum value for each included business as well as provide attractive incentives for new business locations within its boundaries as a result romes new and existing businesses can often utilize multiple public financial incentive and technical assistance programs in addition to accessing traditional commercial financing from eight local financial institutions the rome ez markets itself visits facetoface counseling email or telephone contact as well as provides informational forums presentations and press releases for public consumption further the rome ez has made a concerted effort to educate professional business organizations such as accountants attorneys developers and real estate brokers on the benefits of ez certification ridcs website wwwromenyorg contains information on the rome ez that can be used by interested parties from outside the area this site is closely linked to the citys official website wwwromenygov and the rome area chamber of commerces site wwwromechambercom expected outcomes rome empire zone incentives will function as a catalyst for qualifying businesses to locate and expand within each separate and contiguous area  the additional payroll generated by job creation at these zonecertified businesses provides additional discretionary income toward boosting retail and commercial sales within the area ridcs goal is to assist the city and the main streets alliance with developing an appropriate mix of retail and commercial businesses to multiply the level of discretionary spending and capital turnover use of grants loans and property tax forgiveness the rome ez also collaborates with mv edge ridc and the city toward achieving full buildout of the gbtp as well as maintain the vibrancy of the wrip by providing incentives such as loans property tax abatements or creative leasing arrangements to maintain a firms longterm viability ridc is also the citys representative to the regional economic development planning organization and works very closely with that organization on economic development projects loans and economic development grant applications ll no 1 of 2007 ii 11007 target areasinfrastructure development the rome empire zone has designated 12799 acres of its allotted two square miles or 1280 acres as outlined in attachment 1 the mapping goals are to include as much previously designated ez acreage as possible as well as the necessary natural features ie parts of the mohawk river and new york state barge canal and transportation infrastructure to clearly identify the rome ezs three separate and internallycontiguous areas as mandated under the investment zone format of the empire zones program two united states census tracts within the city were determined to be eligible under general municipal law  958a those requirements stipulate that eligible us census tracts must contain 1 a minimum of 2000 inhabitants and 2 a minimum poverty rate of 20 percent and 3 a minimum unemployment rate of  percent the us census tracts within the city that meet these requirements are #360650223 and #360650225 five contiguous us census tracts which contain designated rome empire zone acreage are tracts #360 #360 #360 #360 and #360650228 one other us census tract #36065022702 contains designated rome empire zone acreage but is neither eligible nor contiguous to either of the two eligible us census tracts within the city area #1 west rome industrial park 1050 acresattachment 2 this contiguous area has been restructured to include acreage deemed desirable for light manufacturing development and reduced by acreage anticipated for future retail development along the rometaberg new york state rte 69 corridor retail development will be enhanced by the recentlycompleted reconstruction of the rte 49rte 46 intersection immediately to the east of this area portions of success drive were added in this area for continuity and one retail business was grandfathered due to its inclusion within the rte  retail corridor as well as the impracticality of using excessive acreage for inclusion previously certified mixed commercial acreage along the rte erie boulevard west corridor has been removed from the rome ez due to their probable future retail development another property the erie canal village and new york state bike trail was removed due to lack of development and the need for acreage to cover higher impact development elsewhere shortterm development goals for this area are to maintain full commercial occupancy by providing incentives for firms entering this area acquisition or buyout and to assist existing firms looking for expansion capital or other nonfinancial forms of technical assistance a major longterm concern is that the riteaid distribution center the largest individual firm located in area #1 may relocate if this relocation occurs the longterm goal of the rome ez will be to collaborate toward the redevelopment of the vacant 275000 squarefoot facility for future light industrial or manufacturing uses area #2 central business district 6058 acresattachment 3 this contiguous area includes the downtown portions of erie boulevard east and west dominick street east and west and james street north and south numerous retail businesses along these thoroughfares were either deleted or grandfathered in mixed commercialresidential zones for the sake of conserving acreage as well as conforming to the strategic development plans of the city the rome ez is working closely with the main streets program to assist downtown revitalization and enhance the individuality of each main street business corridor this is being accomplished not only ez incentives to a limited number of new retail establishments but also by including virtually all the main corridor store frontage in the revised zone to lend support to main street grant funding efforts significant acreage was retained in the erie canalfront former general cable and east dominick street areas to accommodate potential recreationaltourism andor light industrial development the city is attempting to build a municipal sports complexpark near the citys erie canal waterfront which will stimulate recreational activity as well as spur further economic development along the east dominick street corridor the concept for an east rome industrial park is also still under consideration depending upon the final location outcome of the sports complex and any other tourismrelated erie canalfront development the rome ez is working with the rome community brownfields restoration corporation rcbrc to assist with the redevelopment of the former rome cable site which is also located within the cbd three zonecertified businesses currently occupy about onefourth of the facility  efforts are ongoing to further renovate the facility and entice additional tenants acreage was added to cross the erie canal in order to join existing certified businesses on martin street and greenfield road on the south side of the canal with the majority of the cbd which is on the north side of the canal additional acreage was also added  there is potential for further industrial andor commercial development on two open sites as well as in certain existing vacant or partiallyoccupied buildings businesses committed to renovating or rehabilitating vacant manufacturing and retail sites within the cbd will be given high priority for certification especially if those businesses intend to locate within specific targeted commercial corridors real estate development projects will also be considered for certification but the project must clearly and directly result in job creation or buildingland reuse or rehabilitation businesses targeted for inclusion in the cbd are small retail service or professional businesses as well as those that provide supply chain services for industrial or manufacturing businesses these types of businesses may be traded or nontraded though traded firms with significant job creation are ideal the bc ratio matrix provides for a twopoint reduction in the threshold necessary for certification of traded commercialprofessional firms to recognize the wealth that these firms bring to rome empire zone capital credits have been approved for the reach center a facility designed to incubate and encourage entrepreneurial arts cultural and historical enterprises and will also help foster increased tourism and consumer traffic in the cbd businesses locating within this facility may be included for certification based upon their unique cultural niche and tourism value the rome ez has also provided a letter of support to the new york state canal corporation for an erie canal greenway grant which supports the rome ezs goal to increase tourism and the arts within its boundaries another result of obtaining this grant would be to help foster a culturally vibrant community which is becoming an increasing effective recruitment tool for economic development rcbrc ocida and rome up and running have also collaborated with the city to apply for $500000000 in funding under the first round of proposals for the restoreny program  specific components of that proposal impacting the rome ez concern funding for 1 demolition of approximately 240000 square feet of the former rome cable site 2 assist with renovation of the reach center 3 renovate commercial property on 420 n james st and 4 remove a 67acre concrete pad each of these projects will represent a significant enhancement within the cbd for commercial development along with the city the rome main streets alliance is an integral stakeholder in the redevelopment of the cbd the rome ez will collaborate in whatever way possible to facilitate redevelopment in the designated main street corridors the current boundaries of the rome ez have been drawn to accommodate sites along north james street which is well on the way toward economic rejuvenation the potential for ez benefits in this area has already been used to leverage grant funding leading to the redevelopment of infrastructure as well as building redevelopment shortterm rome ez goals for this area are to 1 continue with the redevelopment of the former rome cable facility complex of additional capital from grants legislative member items as well as direct capital investment from additional manufacturing tenants 2 certify more professional service or retail businesses in downtown main streets targeted commercial corridors that will reoccupy currently vacant buildings as well as complement the developing commercial flavor of the immediate neighborhood and 3 work with the city toward redevelopment of the historic canalfront district as well as the manufacturing sites surrounding the vacant general cable complex each of these goals involves direct collaboration with various local public andor private agencies to facilitate technical assistance and provide access to incentives longterm redevelopment goals for the cbd will entail 1 nys brownfield program determination and subsequent redevelopment of the general cable complex perhaps auspices of rcbrc which has been established to administer such projects 2 further collaboration with the main street alliance and the reach center and 3 maintain transparency with the citys comprehensive action plan potential public funding sources for reaching these goals may be attained restoreny program other new york state or local grant programs andor the city  these sources can be used to leverage additional private investment and commercial tenants each of these strategic investment goals involve indirect rome ez support for funding and business attractiondevelopment  the rome ez is positioned to become a direct participant once strategic initiatives become specific projects area #3 griffiss business & technology park 5691 acres attachment 4 major changes in acreage were made to this area with 1561 acres added in the aviation gateway and enterprise way areas attachment 5 this acreage transfer was made not only to consolidate the rome ez for continuity but also to allow the oneida county ez to certify other high value industrial and manufacturing sites within oneida county the new oneida county empire zone is retaining 866 acres of previouslycertified ez land in the gbtp as one of their seven separate areas the five existing ezcertified businesses transferred to the rome ez will be able to access enhanced investment zone benefits for the remainder of their benefit periods the rome ez will also be able to offer investment zone incentives to the open development sites contained in this parcel to further enhance the full commercial occupancy of the gbtp the rome ez also added acreage near the floyd avenue gate of the gbtp as well as acreage in the enterprise way dart circle and skyline summit areas attachment 5 of the park these additions reflect further location refinement of developable sites as well as an incorporation of the development plans of the griffiss local development corporation which is entrusted with the actual development of the entire park acreage and existing facilities firms targeted for inclusion in this area will be primarily traded businesses that will provide stable and high paying jobs  complement existing industry clusters in cybersecurity us defense department and homeland security contracts aviation and financeaccounting  enhance growth in the citys existing business infrastructure  or entice complementary manufacturers technology or professionalcommercial relocation or startup firms the areas of the park having the most shortterm potential for growth are the skyline summit and campus green areas  utilities and infrastructure in the skyline summit area have recently been completed and there is significant ongoing construction of class a office space in the campus green area short and longterm goals for the gbtp are for the rome ez to work with existing firms in order that they remain competitive as well as assist new firms locate in the park as a result of any business turnover of current commercial occupants primary development should occur with manufacturing or serviceprofessional firms in the strategic high technology industry cluster primarily firms involved with information technology and security cybersecurity aeronautics or other related areas other manufacturers may be targeted for the gbtp based upon synergies with local infrastructure and transportation logistics infrastructure development the city has benefited from numerous new york state department of transportation projects  the main bridges connecting the gbtp with black river boulevard chestnut street and with the uticarome expressway rte 825the griffiss parkway have been rebuilt and strengthened to accommodate heavier truck traffic and additional vehicle traffic the uticarome expressway also represents a recent upgrade to the transportation system surrounding the gbtp in that a direct limited access eastwest route now exists for eastbound traffic from rome to utica and exit 31 on the new york state thruway exits 32 westmoreland and 33 verona also are easily reached within ten minutes from downtown rome rome is also less than 30 minutes from syracuse which provides access to interstate route 81 a major northsouth artery to canada or to us appalachian states the west rome industrial park area #1 as well as the rte 69erie boulevard west commercialretail corridor will benefit from the recent widening and adjustment of the thoroughfare which include additional traffic lanes turn lanes new sidewalks and simplified signalsintersections these improvements were made to speed up traffic flow as well as accommodate longer and heavier truck traffic out of the west rome industrial park as well as spur easier access to the citys erie boulevard retail corridor and downtown business district the oneida county airport will be moved to the gbtp by the end of 200 along with the closing and subsequent redevelopment of the former airport site town of whitestown into a business park to be included within the oneida county empire zone this relocation will not only spur cargo freight and further commercial development at the park but will also hasten the development of complimentary service hospitality and professional businesses within the city of rome the new rome free academy which serves as the public high school of the city as well as portions of the towns of lee western annsville and verona has been completed at the gbtp this new facility has technological stateoftheart classrooms as well as spacious new facilities to house over 1800 students in grades nine the skyline summit area of the gbtp across the griffiss parkway from rfa will continue to be upgraded for development with the addition in 2006 of water sewer and electric infrastructure to support a midsize business park as well as a hospitality center in anticipation of the relocation of the oneida county airport the marinuswillet center completed in 200 is located next to the fort stanwix national monument and is the focal point of local tourism by providing not only historical exhibits depicting the rome areas importance to the development of central new york the erie canal and the american revolution but also providing information concerning rome current tourist and recreational attractions recent nys dot improvements to the erie boulevard west corridor and the dominick street intersection on that corridor have been completed  these improvement will aid commercial traffic as well as increased consumer flow currently a project is under way to rebuild the floyd avenue corridor leading to the gbtp  when completed all current access points to the gbtp will be updated for increased traffic loads and volume future nys dot plans call for the improvement of the james streeterie boulevard intersection next to the marinuswillet center in order to bring the intersection to one level and to streamline traffic patterns between erie and black river boulevards as well as to make the dominick street connection between east and west more accessible black river boulevard is also slated for future renovation as well as construction of a fourth access road to the gbtp previously designated acreagegrandfathered firms every effort was made to include as many previouslycertified businesses as possible but a significant number of businesses were grandfathered 31 businesses businesses were grandfathered according to their specific location in relation to their nearest contiguous area and the current zoning ordinance in each business immediate area these two factors are deemed of greatest influence to determine the acreage necessary to include an outlying business and the probability that there may be further ezeligible economic expansion in the immediate area a significant amount of acreage was removed by the deletion of erie canal village where little appreciable capital investmentjob creation has been made or is anticipated in the near future acreage was also deleted from the southwest corner of the former rome cable site due to its environmental and drainage problems that preclude viable economic development regionally significant projects the rome zab will consider applications from businesses outside the rome empire zone boundaries as regionally significant projects rsps under general municipal law  957d after amending the zone boundaries to accommodate the project location certification of the firm undertaking the project will contain a cost benefit analysis reflecting the lowest applicable benefitcost ratio from the certification threshold matrix a small number of specific sites outside of the rome empire zone but within the city are being considered for locating regionally significant projects priority is being given toward making those areas shovelready sites installation of appropriate utilities securing access to major thoroughfares and providing clean environmental phase i studies these areas were not included in the rome ez due to mapping constraints or by an issue involving timely utility or infrastructure improvements that would limit the shortterm availability of a site for commercial development  none of these sites warranted inclusion as a fourth contiguous area for this second reason ll no 1 of 2007 iii 11007 target industriesbusinesses historically the wire and metal manufacturing industries have thrived in the rome area unfortunately many old outdated and abandoned manufacturing sites have resulted in the wake of business restructurings in these industries with two of the largest involving general cable and rome cable corporations rome ez incentives have helped turn a portion of these abandoned sites into opportunities for new businesses such as par government systems rome research corporation and owl wire & cable inc to begin new research and developmentmanufacturing operations additionally new york state dec brownfields designation has been received for the rome cable site with environmental studies having been completed and partial remediation already under way the rome community brownfields restoration corporation rcbrc was formed to oversee these projects with rome industrial development corporation ridc the administrative entity of the rome ez also providing the same services for rcbrc other manufacturing businesses that could potentially benefit from the use of romes existing brownfield sites are being researched and contacted with a number of firms currently negotiating terms for relocation to rome with almost 300000 square feet of available manufacturingdistributionoffice space still remaining vacant at the former rome cable facility the city ridc and rcbrc continue to treat redevelopment of this site with the highest priority the vacant general cable site parts of revere copper products inc south of east dominick street and the erie canalfront district are other highpriority areas for light industrial manufacturing and commercial development the rome ez has included these areas in order to work with either rcbrc andor the city to increase the marketability of existing facilities capable of renovation as well as entice entrepreneurs with innovative development plans it is also anticipated the new york state brownfields designation will eventually be attained for many of the abandoned industrial sites that are not salvageable and require environmental remediation strategic industry clusters the rome ez will target traded firms which are considered traded if they market 60 percent or more of their products andor services beyond the immediate geographical area applicant firms will meet this threshold for certification if they market 60 percent or more of their goodsservices at the time of application or will market 60 percent or more of their goodsservices within two years of certification outside of the city the zab concurs with the analysis of strategic industry clusters

be used as a quantitative tool in the certification process the interim  certification threshold has been adjusted to reflect the relative levels of strategic importance for manufacturing and professionalcommercial firms in the rome ez a historic analysis of the benefitcost ratios of romes currently certified businesses that have received new york state ez incentives over the 20032005 period has shown that manufacturers add approximately one and a half as much economic benefit as professionalcommercial firms and three times as much economic benefit as retailers figure 1 historic bc

serviceprofessional firms and 300 percent more value than retail firms manufacturers especially those new to rome also tend to qualify for more ez incentives than do nonmanufacturers the local basis for this assertion comes from figure 2 which shows that the average manufacturers cost benefit analysis has been  so the certification threshold for all manufacturers traded or nontraded has been established at  applicant businesses considered as serviceprofessional in the benefitcost matrix provide either tangible or intangible services to other commercial business entities to be deemed eligible for certification all serviceprofessional firms must have at least twothirds of their business performed for other firms in strategic industry clusters or are an integral part of the vendor supply chain of a strategic industry clusters traded serviceprofessional firms will be subject to a lower bc certification threshold ratio than nontraded firms due to the greater economic multiplier generated from bringing net income into rome  when taken in proportion to the historic bc ratios shown for these types of firms versus manufacturers and retailers figure 1 the  certification threshold is within reason when compared with the previous cost benefit analyses done by this zone figure 2 nontraded serviceprofessional firms will continue to be subject to the established  certification threshold applicant businesses considered as retail in the benefitcost matrix provide goods wares or merchandise enduser sale to other commercial business entities or consumers retail applicant businesses are assumed to be nontraded  the established certification benchmark will be maintained for all retail firms unless other mitigating factors pertain to a specific applicant firm with a

such finding as its legislative history for the provisions hereinafter enacted a sex offenders as that term is defined at corrections law article 6c pose a significant threat to the health and safety of the community  b according to recent criminal statistics more than twothirds of the victims of sex offenders are children and sex offenders pose a significant threat to the health and safety of children whose age and inexperience makes them particularly vulnerable to the heinous and reprehensible acts of sex offenders  and c the rate of recidivism for sex offenders is high and programs designed to treat and rehabilitate these types of offenders have been largely ineffective limiting the frequency of contact between registered sex offenders and areas where children are likely to congregate reduces the opportunity and temptation and can minimize the risk of repeated acts against minors  and d it is the intention of the city of rome common council to exercise its authority

minors or assure the public that registered sex offenders will comply with the mandate of this article this legislation is intended to create a civil nonpunitive regulatory scheme in order to protect minors to the extent possible under the circumstances and not as a punitive measure of any kind  and g this legislation is rationally related to and will serve to protect the health safety and welfare

inventory is not required 2 minor subdivision a purpose to further the purpose of these subdivision regulations as described in section 621 the purpose of the minor subdivision process is to provide a simplified approval process for simple lot divisions that do not require infrastructure improvements and generally occur in areas already developed b applicability a minor subdivision is the division of a single lot into no more than four lots which front on an existing public or private rightofway are served by existing municipal facilities and do not involve the dedication of land 3 major subdivision a purpose to further the purpose of these subdivision regulations as described in section 621 the purpose of the major subdivision process is to provide an approval process that assesses the impact of larger lot divisions that may require infrastructure improvements b applicability a major subdivision involves any of the following actions a conservation features inventory of previously undeveloped land or land previously in agricultural use per section 626 is required to determine whether the major subdivision must follow conservation design subdivision standards 1 the division of a single lot into five or more lots 2 any division of land that involves construction of new public or private rightsofway the extension of municipal facilities or the dedication of land for public rightsofway parks or other public purposes 4 sustainable designs a conservation subdivision design 1 purpose conservation subdivision design is an evaluation and design process intended to

utilizing conservation design promotes smart growth practices and sustainable development practices 2 applicability describes the triggers for conservation design and conservation design standards b cluster subdivision design 1 purpose cluster subdivision is an optional subdivision process intended to preserve natural and scenic qualities while allowing for smaller lot sizes while maintaining the lot count as calculated under the minimum lot size of the district which normally would not be achievable development cluster subdivision allows for smaller lot development with access to common open space both natural and improved which is an asset that can enhance property values as well as quality of life a traditional subdivision layout is required along with the cluster subdivision layout for planning board review a conservation features inventory of previously undeveloped land or land previously in agricultural use per section 626 should be utilized in the planning and design of the

and technology park the intent of these landscape guidelines is to establish design criteria that create a distinctive working environment and unifies the site landscape with site architecture as well as the overall aesthetic character of the park the park encourages the use of ornamental and shade trees as the primary landscape features and discourages the use of groundcovers and formal planting beds the intent is to maximize the ecosystem benefits provided by tree canopy and reduce the maintenance burden on building owners and park maintenance staff b landscape maintenance i maintenance of unimproved sites undeveloped sites must be maintained in a clean and neat appearance ii maintenance of improved sites a planted areas should be watered fertilized and pruned on a regular basis to maintain a neat and orderly appearance formal lawns must be maintained at a minimum height of two inches and a maximum height of five inches all sites must be kept clean and should remain free of trash debris and brush b all dead or dying plant materials must be replaced on a timely basis to maintain the designed intent of the approved planting plan b landscaping requirements i landscaping within the public rightofway a the public road corridors form the primary access into the park and as such landscape treatment is critical to establish the desired image of the griffiss business and technology park consequently improvements within these corridors are subject to the highest level of regulation b landscape development within the public rightofway will include sidewalks street trees lighting signage grading and site entries the streetscapes at intersections are to be treated with elements of enriched paving lighting and accent planting 1 parkwaymain entries to the rome labr&doffice campus areas at brooks road the industrial area at ellsworth road and the manufacturing complex area at hangar road will be emphasized by the use of distinctive paving tree planting signage and lighting 2 local streetsstandard lighting street trees signage and sidewalks will be installed c all landscape maintenance will be provided by the property owners d landscape within the rightofway will be installed as a continuous linear system demolition of portions of this system will be necessary at vehicular access points during construction of the site access drives it is the responsibility of individual property owners to reconstruct any grading tree planting paving and streetscape amenities disturbed during construction ii landscaping within setback areas a development within the required setback areas is dependent on the needs of individual property owners and tenants and thus is provided a greater degree of flexibility than within the public rightofway landscape guidelines within these areas primarily concern parking areas building fronts and entries and rear and side property line buffering b landscape treatment within the front yard should focus around building facades visible from surrounding streets as well as entry areas the use of ornamental planting lighting signage and other site amenities is encouraged to enrich front yard areas and building entries c it is intended that landscape development within the side and rear yard setback area result in a distinct sense of enclosure and informality while remaining subordinate to the rightofway and front yard landscaping berming is encouraged to reduce the visibility of parking lot service loading storage and maintenance areas from offsite locations iii parking lots see article xv for parking lot landscape requirements c approved plant materials see urban plantings list on file at the city i other site plantings the intent of landscaping within individual sites is to create visually

a objectives the objective of these sustainability guidelines is to ensure that new projects are built to modern specifications for energy efficiency and longterm environmental sustainability b guidelines i on an architectural level this primarily will mean reducing energy consumption by constructing buildings that respond to the local climate orientation shading devices and access to natural ventilation additionally designing buildings with a flexible layout will allow for the long term adaptability of the structures reducing the need for new construction finally the use of sustainable and locallyproduced materials is encouraged as they typically contain less embodied energy and are less harmful to the environment and the buildings occupants ii on a site level it is recommended that new development projects consider sustainable approaches to storm water management this may include the use of green infrastructure best practices iii existing mature site vegetation represents a significant part of the character and charm of griffiss business and technology park and should be maintained to the maximum extent possible  article ix  formbased codes for specific

the total number of required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is based upon the requirements for the principal use or uses located on the lot a where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately unless otherwise permitted by this code b a fraction of less than onehalf is disregarded and a fraction of onehalf or more is counted as one parking or loading space c for uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches pews or open floor areas used for service each 48 linear inches of benches pews or permanent seating areas or five square feet of open floor areas used for seating is counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for the required number of spaces    required offstreet vehicle and bicycle parking spaces a general requirements i except as otherwise provided in this code the minimum and maximum number of offstreet vehicle and bicycle parking spaces to be provided for each use is listed in table 80141 offstreet vehicle and bicycle parking requirements if a space is blank that

listed with specific vehicle parking requirements these specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district certain uses listed within the districts are not listed in table 80141 and therefore do not have vehicle parking requirements iii certain uses listed within table 80141 are required to provide bicycle parking spaces of those uses required to provide bicycle spaces some are also required to provide longterm spaces where bicycles will be left for longer periods of time and require a safe and weatherproof storage area the required number of longterm spaces is shown as a percentage of the required total bicycle spaces all other required bicycle spaces must be designed as shortterm spaces which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops requiring a high degree of convenience iv in all cases where bicycle parking is required a minimum of two bicycle spaces must be provided after the first 25 required bicycle parking spaces are provided additional bicycle parking spaces may be provided at a 50 percent reduction there is no maximum number of bicycle spaces required v where bicycle parking space requirements indicate over 10000 square feet gfa or other number threshold this means that bicycle spaces are required only for structures over a certain gross floor area when this threshold applies bicycle parking space requirements are calculated on the basis of the entire gross floor area vi motorcycle and scooter parking may be substituted for up to four automobile spaces or five percent of the required parking spaces whichever is less b provision of car and bikeshare facilities i spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated

2500 square feet of gross floor area or less located within a multitenant retail center are not eligible for this exemption and must provide the required parking ii existing structures as of the effective date of this code that currently do not provide any parking due to lack of sufficient space on the lot to accommodate parking are exempt from all offstreet vehicle parking requirements

be created to count toward required offstreet parking but must be located along the corner side or front lot line and must be accessible 24 hours a day b where onstreet parking spaces are unmarked the number of parking spaces is calculated by dividing the length of the onstreet parking area located parallel to property line of the property under consideration divided by 18 where a fraction of less than onehalf is disregarded and a fraction of onehalf or more is counted as one space c where onstreet parking spaces are marked each marked space counts as one required parking space including any space where at least 50 percent of the width is located along the lot line of the property under consideration d any subsequent change in the availability of onstreet parking used to meet offstreet parking requirements requires proof that the minimum parking requirements per this section have been met when onstreet parking is made unavailable the use has 90 days from that date to accommodate all required offstreet parking    shared parking a offstreet parking spaces for separate uses may be provided collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required in table 80143 shared parking calculation multitenant retail centers are not eligible for shared parking mixeduse developments multiuse office parks and similar types of development and property owners that establish crossaccess easements are all eligible for shared parking b table 80143 is applied in the following manner i the required number of spaces for each use is calculated according table 80141 ii the required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the percentages for each timeframe according to the appropriate land use category in table 80143 to determine the number of required spaces this is done for each timeframe category iii the numbers are summed for within each timeframe and the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces table

to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public safety ii when the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity iii when the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity for example if a structure is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback ie does not meet the required minimum the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all other district regulations iv when the alteration is as described in item e below d relocation a nonconforming structure cannot be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would make the structure conforming a nonconforming structure may be relocated to another lot if the structure conforms to all

act govern except that no jury trial is allowed for an offense as defined in this code  article xxii  rightofway and access standards   purpose the purpose of these rightofway and access standards is to a design rightsofway to provide safe convenient and functional pedestrian bicycle and vehicular traffic flow b design circulation patterns within communities so that children can walk to school c encourage safe pedestrian routes to transit d use visual cues and design elements to indicate pedestrian rightsofway and minimize conflicts e make places walkable for aging populations in response to new demographics and special needs f limit the use of culdesacs when possible    blocks a block length residential blocks must not exceed 1000 feet in length unless approved by the city engineer b block design i the shape of a new block must be generally rectangular but may vary to conform to natural features highway and rail rightsofway park boundaries or site constraints where blocks curve they must generally maintain their cardinal orientation over their entire trajectory ii new rightsofway must connect to and extend the existing block network where possible this requirement does not apply when connections cannot be made because of a natural or manmade barrier such as existing structures steep slopes wetlands and waterbodies railroad and utility rightsofway and parks and dedicated open space iii all rightsofway must terminate at other rightsofway forming a network the city engineer may approve culdesacs and deadend streets when they meet the following criteria a no connection is available to an existing adjacent development or a natural or manmade barrier such as a waterway railroad limitedaccess expressway or unusual topography exists that prevents connection b the culdesac or deadend street is no more than 600 feet in length as measured along the centerline from the closest intersection iv where adjoining areas are not developed rightsofway in new subdivisions must extend to the project boundary line where feasible to make provision for the future projection of rightsofway into the adjoining areas v alleys may be required for new or reconfigured blocks where blocks have an existing alley such alley must be maintained    general rightofway standards all new construction reconstruction and reconfiguration of rightsofway must comply with this section this does not apply to limited access expressways rightsofway must be designed in relation to topographic and drainage conditions public safety and the development served by the rightofway a rightofway construction i all rightofway construction and repair must be in accordance with standards and specifications set forth by the city engineer ii vertical and horizontal alignment must be in accordance with standards and specifications set forth by the city engineer iii street grades must conform in general to the terrain and the minimum grade will be based on surface type of the roadway as determined by the city engineer b access and intersection requirements i all public and private rightsofway must be improved as complete streets a complete street is defined as rightofway facilities that are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users persons with disabilities pedestrians bicyclists motorists and transit riders are able to safely move along and across a rightofway designed as a complete street ii if a new subdivision involves frontage on a major street the street layout should be planned to avoid to the extent possible any private residential driveways from having direct access to such streets iii street intersections must be at right angles if because of topography or other natural or manmade barriers an intersection cannot be at right angles the intersection may use an alternate design that ensures safety c property line and curb radius curb radii cannot be less than 25 feet and must be increased proportionately where the angle of intersection is less than 50 degrees these minimums may be increased where the city engineer finds that larger arcs or radii are necessary for the proper design of the intersection d drainage proper drainage is the responsibility of the subdivider the type of drainage system and its design must be approved by the city engineer green infrastructure designs are encouraged e utility installation prior to paving of streets or sidewalks water and sewer mains and services must be in place or the developer must provide necessary casing for utilities no pavement may be cut without the approval of the city engineer no boring of new pavement is allowed for the installation of new service lines mains or other facilities unless approved by the city engineer    sidewalk design standards a sidewalks must be provided on both sides of all rightsofway with the exception of a rural rightofway type per section 80226 or when determined by the planning board that sidewalks do not need to be installed sidewalks are not required where one side of the rightofway is a steep vertical wall railroad or other feature where the public does not require access b sidewalks must be paved with a permanent fixed nonslip material c sidewalks must be as straight and direct as possible d where sidewalks cross driveways the sidewalk zone must remain level with no change in crossslope    bicycle lane design standards where bicycles lanes are included in rightofway construction reconstruction and reconfiguration projects appropriate designs include but are not limited to the design types of this section where installed bicycle facilities should be constructed in accordance with the manual on uniform traffic control mutcd and the urban bikeway design guide published by the national association of city transportation officials nacto a shared a marking placed in a vehicular travel lane to indicate that a bicyclist may use the full lane also called a sharedlane marking b bike lane a portion of the roadway that has been designated by striping signs and pavement markings for the preferential or exclusive use of bicyclists typically located adjacent to motor vehicle travel lanes and flowing in the same direction as motor vehicle traffic c buffered bike lane a conventional bicycle lane paired with a designated buffer space separating the bicycle lane from the adjacent motor vehicle travel lane andor parking lane d contraflow bike lane a bicycle lane designed to allow bicyclists to ride in the opposite direction of motor vehicle traffic typically used to convert a oneway traffic street into a twoway street one direction being for motor vehicles and bikes and the other being for bikes only e leftside bike lane a conventional bike lane placed on the left side of oneway streets or twoway median divided streets f cycle track an exclusive bike facility that combines the user experience of a separated path with the onstreet infrastructure of a conventional bike lane a cycle track is physically separated from motor traffic and distinct from the sidewalk g raised cycle track a bicycle facility that is vertically separated from motor vehicle traffic typically paired with a furnishing zone between the cycle track and motor vehicle travel lane andor pedestrian area and allowing for oneway or twoway travel by bicyclists h twoway cycle track a physically separated cycle track that allows bicycle movement in both directions on one side of the road    rightofway dimensions all rightsofway must match one of the rightofway types of this section which may be modified as needed by the city engineer to address specific site conditions a rightofway types the classifications of rightsofway are divided into the following i major streets carry the majority of trips entering and leaving the city as well as the majority of ii collector streets provide both access to and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods commercial and industrial areas collector streets differ from major streets in that collector streets enter residential neighborhoods distributing trips from arterials area to destinations collector streets also collect traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel into the arterial system iii minor streets primarily provide direct access to abutting land and access to the higher order street iv alleys are a vehicular drive located to the rear of lots providing access to service areas parking and outbuildings and often containing utility easements v rural roads provide access and circulation of the planning area that are largely undeveloped or rural in character b rightofway dimensional requirements minimum dimensions are provided for each rightofway type in this section the illustrative examples are also provided to illustrate a potential configuration of a rightofway type variations to these configurations may be approved by the city engineer all dimensions indicated are minimums
