of fact it has been determined by the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec that a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the state  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a

1771 legislative intent by  20b of the general city laws as added by of the laws of 193 and as amended by of the laws of 194 cities are authorized to enact local laws imposing a tax such as is imposed by  186a of the tax law pursuant to such authority this modeled upon said  186a it is intended thereby and likewise by this enacted pursuant to the abovementioned authority to impose a tax on utility services whether rendered by utilities in the strict sense or not and whether such services are in the main or incidental part of their business and regardless of whether the public streets are used in any manner accordingly such a utility is defined for the purposes of the tax as including every person subject to the supervision of the department of public service and every other person furnishing utility services it is intended to include persons and corporations which are directly in competition with ordinary utilities such as landlords and submeterers who buy their services from other utilities and in turn resell such services for that reason the tax is imposed in receipts from sales to ultimate consumers receipts from the sale of such utility services to submeterers are not taxed but receipts of submeterers from their own customers are intended to be taxed any other construction would result in a complete exemption from taxation of utility services sold or furnished by this particular method furthermore it is believed that submeterers have common characteristics that distinguish them from other businesses and justify the conclusion that the method character and nature of their business in this aspect is substantially similar to the business of an ordinary utility and requires similar treatment for the purposes of the tax this conclusion is strongly fortified by the fact that such landlords and submeterers are in direct competition with ordinary utilities and hence should bear similar tax burdens in order to avoid inequality of treatment  1772 imposition
