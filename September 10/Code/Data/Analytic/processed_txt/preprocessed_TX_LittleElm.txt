authorization the legislature of the state has in vtca water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses art i  a 3171997 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art i  b 3171997 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area art i  c 3171997 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art i  d 3171997 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give

town engineer engineering plans and specifications shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the state and experienced in civil engineering work the total cost for such engineering plans and specifications shall be borne by the developer and shall be furnished to the town engineer for their review and approval storage general stormwater management programs aimed at controlling increased stream water runoff generated by development are a top priority in urban watershed planning more frequent flooding increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff increased stream channel erosion and degradation increased sedimentation and increased water pollution are all problems intensified by increased stormwater runoff resulting from development storage of excess urban storm runoff is one of the most promising methods available in preventing urban flood damage storm runoff storage with reduced release rates can hold downstream flood flows to within the safe conveyance capacity of the storm sewer and stream system in most cases it can be shown that storage is more economical than increasing downstream conveyance capacity storage facilities should be planned and designed to assure an effective and efficient operation and maintenance program retention and detention are two generalized types of storm runoff storage used to control flooding retention storage refers to storm runoff collected and stored for a significant period and released or used after storm runoff has ended retention storage usually consists of wet reservoirs which often have agricultural recreational andor aesthetic value detention storage consists of reducing the rate of runoff for a short period of time to reduce peak flows by controlling the discharge outlet structure and by extending the period of runoff skillful use of the procedures outlined in this section will provide reasonable solutions to drainage policy requirements individual and community experience in the use of these techniques will evolve into a methodology which will allow urban growth without the attendant drainage problems storage classification storage can be classified by location as follows a rainfall storage the storage of water near the point of rainfall occurrence or before storm runoff accumulates significantly rainfall storage is usually accomplished by roof top ponding parking lot ponding property line swale ponding and small onsite ponds b runoff storage water stored after storm runoff has accumulated significantly and begun to flow in a drainage system runoff storage is usually accomplished by off stream storage channel storage or onstream storage rainfall storage a roof tops the building codes require roof load design for rain and snow the design load may be converted to equivalent water depth in inches which can be safely contained on flat roofs the maximum storage allowed for design purposes should not exceed this depth unless a building is designed to withstand a greater roof load the depth of water can be controlled by proper sizing of downspouts and by constructing scuppers parapet walls another method of achieving roof top ponding involves placing loose gravel windrows or dikes a few inches in heights so that storm runoff is trapped as it moves toward the drainage outlet individual wedgeshaped ponds form behind the small dikes and slowly drain as the stormwater filters gravel this solution is of limited value however as there is no way to assure its permanence the possibility of overflows exist and will occur quite often during major storms overflow drains should be used to protect against roof overloading periodic inspection and proper maintenance will reduce the possibility and the hazards of overflows special attention must be given to the water tightness of the roof to assure that no leakage occurs due to the accumulation of water b parking lots considerable area in urban development is occupied by parking lots if planned correctly these paved areas can provide adequate detention with minimum inconvenience to the public and without functional interference there are two general methods of stormwater detention that can be utilized on parking areas one form involves the storage of runoff in depressions constructed near drains or outfall structures the second method of stormwater detention on parking lots consists of using the paved parking areas to channel stormwater to grassed or gravel filled areas for maximum infiltration and decrease in overland flow c recreation areas recreation areas such as sports fields generally have a substantial area of grass cover which often has a high infiltration rate storm runoff from such fields is minimal a secondary use of such recreation fields can be made by providing for limited detention storage of runoff from adjacent areas since these areas are not used during periods of precipitation detention ponding should not seriously impede their primary use to minimize after effects the recreation area should be designed so that it will thoroughly drain in addition the vegetation used on the area should be tolerant of periodic inundation and wetness d property line swales subdivision planning and layout requires adequate surface drainage away from buildings this is obtained by sloping the finished grade in all directions away from the building the layout often calls for a swale to be located along the back property line which then drains longitudinally block where this is used the design shall include a concrete flume section with baffles to slow the flow of water yet maintain constant point for discharge temporary ponding facilities along the rear lot line may include small controlled discharges along the back property line or if the subsoil conditions are favorable several inches of rainfall could be expected to percolate into the ground during and after a storm prior to planning for property line swale ponding the engineer should determine that saturation of the subsoil will not have an adverse effect on building foundations in cases where significant subsoil problems exist water should not be ponded or percolated into the ground e combinations in many instances one onsite detention method cannot conveniently or economically satisfy the required or needed amount of stormwater storage limitations in storage capacities site development conditions soils limitations and other related constraints may require that more than one method be utilized for example rooftop parking lot and surface pond storage might all be required to compensate for the increase in runoff due to development of a particular site whatever combinations are suitable may be incorporated into a site development plan runoff storage a offstream storage the storage of water in depressed open areas in reservoirs and on low lying recreation fields to which storm peak flows are routed in usually termed offstream storage it is usually characterized by a side channel spillway or overflow from the main channel b channel storage although all channels inherently store water channels can be made to attenuate runoff by altering their hydraulic characteristics in a way that will reduce peak flows side channels that run essentially parallel to the main stream channel are also a means of temporarily storing water during excessive rainfall events c onstream storage the construction of an embankment across a channel so that a storage pond is formed represents onstream storage spillway considerations are important to pass large floods exceeding the storage capacity properly protected roadway embankments are well suited for this purpose multipurpose use rainfall storage and runoff storage systems are most practical when designed for multipurpose use for maximum land use efficiency the design engineer must consult early with the planning department and the parks and recreation department of the town lower cost recreationmaking use of detention storage areas as parks and greenbelts ballfields and playing fields satisfies two needs and reduces the cost of each the minipark concept where small recreational areas are provided in neighborhoods within safe walking distances for children can be a typical joint effort of the drainage design engineer and the planning and recreational staffs of the town provisions must be made for maintenance of such areas multiuse criteriathe multiple use of storage areas is a field of endeavor where the fervent disciplines should develop desirable and acceptable criteria fitting the needs of the local community it is with storage including both detention and retention storage that an important potential exists for the reduction of flooding drainage costs and to some degree recreation costs hydraulic design criteria a general hydraulic and hydrologic design criteria provide the guidelines for design and construction of stormwater storage facilities these criteria are a necessary part of a stormwater management program needed to protect lowlying areas by preventing unacceptable increases in runoff rates as urban development progresses the engineer should be familiar with the drainage policy of this article before considering the feasibility of a storm runoff detention facility existing land contours of the property should be a consideration in developing the drainage plan in many instances storage can be achieved economically by blocking the overland flow of stormwater runoff with various land forms curbs walls terraces and other means the amounts to designing a drainage system that will minimize the reduction in the critical time of concentration as the property is developed a drainage project located in a watershed that has a master plan may involve additional considerations which require review consultation with the town is essential to ensure compliance with the overall watershed master plan b design factors and procedures before proceeding with engineering design of an onsite storage facility the physical and technical factors should be identified and the basic design procedures established a discussion of design factors and procedures follow 1 the drainage plans for a particular storage facility should include all property lines topography area location and all other items necessary to meet policy requirements outlined in the drainage policy for the town 2 care must be taken to locate layout and design the storage facility in a manner to ensure safety and ease of maintenance 3 the rate of inflow to the storage facility inflow hydrographs and all hydrologic considerations must assume ultimate development of the sites contributing area several inflow hydrographs should be prepared to examine their effect on downstream flooding for the various design storm frequencies the number of inflow hydrographs to be provided may vary but should always adequately describe the range of flows expected for the design storm frequencies these various design storm inflow hydrographs and an acceptable flood routing procedure will be necessary in sizing the outlet works for the storage facility an emergency spillway should be provided to pass runoff that exceeds the design capacity of the detention facility 4 the maximum allowable release rate from a storage facility is selected after careful review of runoff rates for all pertinent storms as a minimum the pertinent design storm frequencies should include the ten 25 and 100year events however specific site conditions may require that additional consideration be given a particular area the town engineering department should be contacted to identify special design conditions the maximum allowable peak flow released from a particular site is selected to comply with the policy section of this manual in all cases the maximum release rate should be calculated using the hydraulic gradient created when the storage area is being utilized at full capacity key items to consider in determining the maximum allowable release rate are a the peak flow rates for the various design storm frequencies prior to development b the capacity of the downstream stormwater channel or storm sewer c compliance with a master plan for the watershed if one exists d problems if any that are created onsite by the storage of stormwater runoff e potential problems created downstream when the onsite storage capacity is fully utilized and the excess runoff flows overland into downstream areas 5 the stormwater storage volume required is given by the maximum difference at any time between cumulative total inflow volume and cumulative outflow volume measured from the beginning of inflow for a 25year storm the maximum allowable release rate is not to be exceeded by the outflow peak discharge 6 the outfall or outlet structures should be designed on the basis of inlet or outlet control whichever is applicable the structures should be capable of safely and properly passing the flow range of design storm frequencies including the 100year storm without causing downstream flooding or exceeding the maximum allowable release rate outlet works must also pass all of the runoff from the 100year design storm within a reasonable length of time or a permit may be required from the texas commission on environmental quality tceq wet ponds will in many cases also require a permit from the tceq 7 special attention should be given to the provision of an emergency or overflow spillway which would pass excess flows greater than those of the 25year design storm and overflows caused by clogging of the principal outlets downstream watershed considerations such as the potential loss of life and damage to property due to overtopping or failure of the structure and the storage facilities area and capacity dictate the emergency spillway design storm it is advisable to contact the state agencies such as the texas water development board twdb and the tceq when planning a storage facility in order to meet their criteria hydraulic design methods a general the two basic methods suggested for predicting the volume of runoff with time and the peak flow rate are the rational method and the standard method the standard method is best suited for storage analysis of urban runoff but for relatively small drainage areas some form of the rational method if generally acceptable b rational method storage analysis when designing storage facilities for an area smaller than 400 acres it is often justifiable to use the rational method to compute the design inflow hydrographs this method relies heavily upon personal judgment but it is relatively simple and can give acceptable results if proper procedures are followed there are several different techniques of employing the rational method that may be used one of the rational method techniques has been utilized by the federal aviation agency in designing airport drainage facilities the procedure is presented in airport drainage prepared by the federal aviation agency faa 1966 the faa technique is basically a graphical procedure which represents the cumulative storm runoff volume and the cumulative volume released from the storage facility outlet structure as functions of time the maximum difference between the two volume curves represents the required storage volume of the storage basin the procedure will consistently result in under designed storage facilities if a constant release rate is assumed from time zero this is caused by sizing the outlet pipe using the manning equation and not recognizing the stagedischarge relationship a reservoir routing technique unitizing the stagedischarge relationship of the storage facility should be used it is recommended that in most instances the contributing drainage area not be more than 25 acres when using this technique a second technique that employs the rational method is referred to as the modified rational method analysis this technique manipulates the rational method to reflect the fact that storms with durations greater than the normal time of concentration for a basin will result in a larger volume of runoff even though the peak discharge is reduced even though rainfall intensities and resulting peak discharges associated with longer duration storms are less than those for short duration storms the inflow may still be considerably greater than the outflow thus requiring more storage than in the case of shorter higher intensity storms this approach becomes more valid on progressively smaller basins the technique should therefore be limited to relatively small areas such as parking lots roof tops or other upstream facilities with contributing areas less than 25 acres detention facilities intent the town of little elm encourages the use of detention basins based on the multifaceted benefits of the community outlined below 1 control of flood discharges the intent of detention basin storage design shall be to reduce flood discharges for the ultimate watershed development conditions without increasing peak discharges above the peak discharges for undeveloped watershed conditions this storage method serves as a key strategy for the stormwater management plan 2 environment as development occurs there is a loss of wildlife and bird life habitat it is possible to create a natural microenvironment around ponds that can offset this loss of habitat these natural environmental pockets in conjunction with natural open space areas can help maintain the rural setting of the town detention ponds also benefit downstream water quality by allowing the sedimentation of pollutants 3 recreation detention basins offer many recreational opportunities in an urban setting  for example a normally dry detention basin could be used for athletic fields or picnics areas while the banks of the pond offer valuable park space 4 aesthetics as an integral part of the town of little elm a detention basin needs to blend into the landscape and into the community simple yet inexpensive measures such as gentle side slopes planting of trees and shrubs and other landscaping features can transform the detention facility into an attractive amenity for the neighborhood requirements 1 detailed engineering studies of the entire basin shall be required to evaluate the timing of hydrographs from regional and onsite facilities as well as backwater calculations to determine the effect of the detentionretention facilities on upstream water surface elevations 2 all detention facility designs shall be performed by a professional engineer registered in the state of texas and shall meet the requirements of permanent rule 31 tex admin other requirements as applicable 3 the minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall be that volume required to reduce runoff rate to the undeveloped condition rate dedicated detention basins shall also include an additional one foot of freeboard and two feet of sediment storage the volume of runoff storage for drainage areas greater than 160 acres shall be compared using unit hydrograph procedures acceptable unit hydrograph procedures include the soil conservation service dimension less unit hydrograph and snyders unit hydrograph manual methods or use of the computer programs tr20 hec1 and nudallas are allowed for runoff hydrograph computation and flood routings the criteria contained in this section shall serve as the minimum requirements for detention basin design for drainage areas less than 160 acres the above methods are recommended  however an approximate routing method may be used subject to approval of the town engineer 4 the maximum allowable release rate from any site shall be equal to the 100year peak runoff rate prior to site development the maximum design release rate may be less 5 where stormwater management improvements are required in the natural floodway or a permanent greenbelt or open space area they should be incorporated into existing lakes or they should be designed in as small an area as feasible to create natural contours note however that detention basins or retention ponds shall be a minimum of one acre in size to allow for proper maintenance side slopes and outlet work operation 6 retentiondetention ponds shall resemble natural ponds  in addition a the pond should expand gradually from the inlet towards the outlet ensuring that there are no dead zones that is water entering the pond gradually spread out and uniformly displaces the water already present in the pond b the lengthtowidth ratio should be three to one or greater to provide a long flow path c the average permanent pond depth should be greater than five feet where possible d a ten to 20 foot wide shallow bench shall be provided along the shores of the permanent pond for safety and to encourage the development of bottom growth in these areas this vegetation will enhance the biologic treatment characteristics of the pond and also enhance the natural appearance of the pond 7 if several ponds are required they should vary in size and shape and be separated by tree groves vegetated berms or similar screening of a natural appearance 8 landscape materials should enhance wildlife habitat where feasible 9 where slope erosion protection is needed for the side slopes of a pond rock or geotextiles are required as approved by the town engineer exposed concrete surfaces shall be faced with embedded rock or aggregate masonry bare concrete shall only be permitted with the express written permission of the town council side slopes should be no steeper than  where feasible for reasons of public safety and maintenance 10 detention facilities of less than ten acrefeet of flood storage shall have outlet structures designed for the 100year frequency storm facilities greater than ten acrefeet of flood storage shall have outlet structures designed for the tenyear and 100year frequency storms the release rates shall be such that the flows after land development are no larger than the flows before land development 11 outlets should be provided with a trash rack to prevent plugging with debris and to provide safety to the public due to unique design considerations the town engineer may approve alternative outlet design 12 all federal state and county laws pertaining to the impoundment of surface water shall have been compiled with including the design construction and safety of the impounding structure copies of any federal state or county permits issued for the proposed impoundments shall be submitted to the town engineer 13 all detentionretention facilities shall include an additional one foot of freeboard and two feet of sediment in determining the design flood elevation 14 provisions such as emergency spillways or reinforcing of embankments shall be made for the occurrence of overtopping or failure of the outlet structure under no circumstances should the emergency overflow have a direct path to any buildings or other structures used for human occupancy commerce or industry details of these provisions shall be supplied to the town engineer for approval 15 the flood storage volume of detentionretention facilities shall be designed to empty in a maximum of 12 hours if said facilities are to be considered an erosionpollution control facility 16 consideration should be given to the stocking of retention ponds with fish to control algae growth 17 inlet structures shall be designed to both dissipate the flow energy and drop the inflow elevation to below that of the ponds water surface or basins flow line ix 242003 duties of the town and appeal to the council the interpretation of the criteria hereinabove

appendices aj referenced in this article are on file and may be viewed at the town office introduction and objectives water supply has always been a key issue in the development of texas in recent years the increasing population and economic development of north central texas have led to growing demands for water supplies at the same time local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely already developed additional supplies to meet future demands will be expensive and difficult to secure severe drought conditions in recent years have highlighted the importance of efficient use of our existing supplies to make them last as long as possible this will delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies and delay the high cost of additional water supply development recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the tceq has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for municipal uses by public water suppliers 2 the tceq guidelines and requirements for wholesale suppliers are included in appendix b the north texas municipal water district ntmwd or district has developed this water conservation plan to be consistent with tceq guidelines and requirements the best management practices established by the water

longterm water savings this plan replaces the previous plans ordinances 721 722 837 838 105 and 1229 the objectives of this water conservation plan are as follows 1 to reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts 2 to reduce the loss and waste of water 3 to improve efficiency in the use of water 4 encourage efficient outdoor water use 5 to maximize the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply 6 to extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth indemand exh a 4162019 definitions and abbreviations athletic field means

residential per capita water use below the specified amount in gallons per capita per day in a dry year as shown in the completed table 51 ntmwd will publish the amount of reuse to be is calculating the credit for reuse 2 maintain the water loss percentage in the system below 12 percent annually in 2018 and subsequent years as discussed in section 1023183 the 12 percent goal for water loss is recommended but is not required systems with long distances between customers such as rural systems may adopt a higher percent nonrevenue water goal 3 implement and maintain a program of universal

water use and controlling losses diversions and leaks it is important to carefully meter water use detect and repair leaks in the distribution system and provide regular monitoring of real losses 1 accurate metering of treated water deliveries from ntmwd water deliveries to little elm from ntmwd are metered by ntmwd using meters with accuracy of 2 percent these meters are calibrated on an annual basis by ntmwd to maintain the required accuracy 2 metering of customer and public uses and meter testing repair and replacement the town of little elm currently meters the water to all customers including public and governmental users the town of little elm already meters retail and wholesale water users the town of little elm test and replace their customer meters on a regular basis all customer meters should be replaced on a minimum of a 15year cycle 3 determination and control of water loss total water loss is the difference between the water delivered to little elm from ntmwd and other supplies if applicable and the metered water sales to customers plus water authorized for use but not sold authorized for use but not sold would include use for firefighting releases for flushing of lines uses associated with new construction etc total water loss includes two categories a apparent lossesincludes inaccuracies in customer meters customer meters tend to run more slowly as they age and underreport actual use  losses due to b illegal connections and theftincluded in appendix h  accounts that are being used but have not yet been added to the billing system c real lossesincludes physical losses from the system or mains reported breaks and leaks storage overflow and unreported losses measures to control water loss are part of the routine operations of little elm maintenance crews and personnel should look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system a leak detection and repair program is described in section 1023184 below meter readers should watch for and report signs of illegal connections so that they can be quickly addressed total water loss should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of appendix j with the measures described in this plan little elm goal is to maintain a water loss percentage below 12 percent in 2018 each year if total water loss exceeds this goal little elm will implement a more intensive audit to determine the sources of loss and to reduce the water loss the annual conservation report described below is the primary tool that should be used to monitor water loss 4 leak detection and repair as described above water utility crews and personnel should look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system areas of the water distribution system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur should be targeted for replacement as funds are available 5 record management system as required by tac title 30 a1b a record management system should allow for the separation of water sales and uses into residential commercial publicinstitutional and industrial categories this information should be included in an annual water conservation report as described in section 102319f below those entities whose record management systems do not currently comply with this requirement should move to implement such a system within the next five years b continuing public education and information campaign the continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation includes the following elements 1 utilize the water iq know your water and other public education materials produced by ntmwd 2 utilize the water4otter campaign for students 3 insert water conservation information with water bills inserts will include material developed by town of little elm staff and material obtained from the twdb tceq and other sources 4 encourage local media coverage of water conservation issues and the importance of water conservation 5 notify local

fixtures in new construction and renovations since 1992 the state standards call for flows of no more than 25 gallons per minute gpm for faucets 25 gpm for showerheads as of  the state requires maximum average flow rates of 128 gallons per flush gpf for toilets and 05 gpf for urinals similar standards are now required under federal law these state and federal standards assure that all new construction and renovations will use waterconserving fixtures rebate programs to encourage replacement of older fixtures with water conservation programs are discussed in section 102319e b reuse and recycling of wastewater most member cities and customers do not own and operate their own wastewater treatment plants their wastewater is treated by ntmwd ntmwd currently has the largest wastewater reuse program in the state ntmwd has water rights allowing reuse of up to 71882 acrefeet per year of treated wastewater discharges from the wilson creek wastewater treatment plant for municipal purposes in addition ntmwd has also developed the east fork reuse project which can divert up to 157393 acrefeet per year based on treated wastewater discharges by ntmwd with the addition of the main stem pump station the district will be able to increase flows east fork reuse project up to an additional 56100 acrefeet per year when fully developed these three reuse projects will provide up to 42 percent of the ntmwds currently permitted water supplies ntmwd also provides treated effluent from its wastewater treatment plants available for direct reuse for landscape irrigation and industrial use the town of little elm owns and operates their own wastewater treatment plants and currently is utilizing reuse of treated effluent for washdown processes belt press operations and for irrigation purposes at the plant site little elm continues to seek other alternatives for reuse of recycled wastewater effluent c interactive weather stationswater my yard program ntmwd has developed the water my yard program to install weather stations throughout its service area in order to provide consumers with a weekly email and information water my yard website to assist consumers in determining an adequate amount of supplemental water to maintain healthy grass in a specific location this service represents the largest network of weather stations providing etbased irrigation recommendations in the state of texas and provides the public advanced information regarding outdoor irrigation needs thereby reducing water use through a series of selections on the type of irrigation system a consumer has a weekly email is provided that will determine how long in minutes an irrigation system needs to run based on the past seven days of weather this recommendation provides the actual amount of supplemental water that is required for a healthy lawn based on research of the texas a&m agrilife extension service and proven technologies this innovative program has been available to those within the ntmwd service area since may 2013 the cityutility will encourage customers to subscribe to weekly watering updates my yard or other similar program in an effort to reduce outdoor water consumption

within a floodplain of drainage channel which will obstruct the natural flow of water within that floodplain or channel c no excavation filling or construction of embankment or landscaping shall be permitted within a floodplain or channel which will obstruct the natural flow of the water within that floodplain or channel unless sufficient engineering design information is furnished to the town engineer in order that they may determine that same will not adversely affect flow characteristics within that floodplain or channel resulting in damage to that or any other property nearby 2 building or structure setback requirement no building or structure shall hereafter be constructed reconstructed or relocated within 20 feet of any open drainage channel it is the intent of this section to ensure that an unobstructed width of at least 20 feet is maintained between the top side slope of any such drainage channel and any building or structure 3 construction over drainage facilities no building or structure shall hereafter be constructed reconstructed or relocated over or across any storm drainage facility unless specifically approved by the town engineer pursuant to that criteria established in paragraphs a and b below a construction of buildings roadways or structures may be permitted over or across closed drainage systems to include concrete box culverts or reinforced

and approval by the town engineer 4 storage general stormwater management programs aimed at controlling increased stream water runoff generated by development are a top priority in urban watershed planning more frequent flooding increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff increased stream channel erosion and degradation increased sedimentation and increased water pollution are all problems intensified by increased stormwater runoff resulting from development storage of excess urban storm runoff is one of the most promising methods available in preventing urban flood damage a storm runoff storage with reduced release rates can hold downstream flood flows to within the safe conveyance capacity of the storm sewer and stream system in most cases it can be shown that storage is more economical than increasing downstream conveyance capacity storage facilities should be planned and designed to ensure an effective and efficient operation and maintenance program b retention and detention are two generalized types of storm runoff storage used to control flooding retention storage refers to storm runoff collected and stored for a significant period and released or used after storm runoff has ended retention storage usually consists of wet reservoirs which often have agricultural recreational andor aesthetic value detention storage consists of reducing the rate of runoff for a short period of time to reduce peak flows by controlling the discharge outlet structure and by extending the period of runoff c skillful use of the procedures outlined in this section will provide reasonable solutions to drainage policy requirements individual and community experience in the use of these techniques will evolve into a methodology which will allow urban growth without the attendant drainage problems 5 storage classification storage can be classified by location as follows a rainfall storage the storage of water near the point of rainfall occurrence or before storm runoff accumulates significantly rainfall storage is usually accomplished by roof top ponding parking lot ponding property line swale ponding and small onsite ponds b runoff storage water stored after storm runoff has accumulated significantly and begun to flow in a drainage system runoff storage is usually accomplished by off stream storage channel storage or onstream storage 6 rainfall storage a rooftops the building codes require roof load design for rain and snow and its subsequent removal drainage or evaporation from the roof under no circumstances shall the design for a nonresidential flat roof allow planned ponding b parking lots bioswales are encouraged for use in parking lots rather than curb and gutter between the parking spaces water moving across the parking area shall be filtered before entering the sewer system c recreation areas recreation areas such as sports fields generally have a substantial area of grass cover which often has a high infiltration rate storm runoff from such fields is minimal a secondary use of such recreation fields can be made by providing for limited detention storage of runoff from adjacent areas d periods of precipitation since these areas are not used during periods of precipitation detention ponding should not seriously impede their primary use to minimize after effects the recreation area should be designed so that it will thoroughly drain in addition the vegetation used on the area should be tolerant of periodic inundation and wetness e property line swales subdivision planning and layout requires adequate surface drainage away from buildings this is obtained by sloping the finished grade in all directions away from the building the layout often calls for a swale to be located along the back property line which then drains longitudinally block the use of natural swales for drainage is allowed  concrete flumes are not allowed f ponding temporary ponding facilities along the rear lot line may include small controlled discharges along the back property line or if the subsoil conditions are favorable several inches of rainfall could be expected to percolate into the ground during and after a storm g subsoil prior to planning for property line swale ponding the engineer should determine that saturation of the subsoil will not have an adverse effect on building foundations in cases where significant subsoil problems exist water should not be ponded or percolated into the ground h combinations in many instances one onsite detention method cannot conveniently or economically satisfy the required or needed amount of stormwater storage limitations in storage capacities site development conditions soils limitations and other related constraints may require that more than one method be utilized for example roof top parking lot and surface pond storage might all be required to compensate for the increase in runoff due to development of a particular site whatever combinations are suitable may be incorporated into a site development plan 7 runoff storage a offstream storage the storage of water in depressed open areas in reservoirs and on low lying recreation fields to which storm peak flows are routed in usually termed offstream storage it is usually characterized by a side channel spillway or overflow from the main channel b onstream storage the construction of an embankment across a channel so that a storage pond is formed represents onstream storage spillway considerations are important to pass large floods exceeding the storage capacity properly protected roadway embankments are well suited for this purpose c channel storage although all channels inherently store water channels can be made to attenuate runoff by altering their hydraulic characteristics in a way that will reduce peak flows side channels that run essentially parallel to the main stream channel are also a means of temporarily storing water during excessive rainfall events 8 multipurpose use a rainfall storage and runoff storage systems are most practical when designed for multipurpose use for maximum land use efficiency the design engineer must consult early with the planning department and the parks and recreation department of the town b lower cost recreation using detention storage areas as parks and greenbelts ballfields and playing fields is an efficient use of unbuildable land and reduces the towns cost of open space facilities c multiuse criteria the multiple use of floodway storage areas is a desirable manner in meeting the recreation needs of the local community both detention and retention storage may provide recreation areas in addition to their primary function in the reduction of flooding 9 all development proposed adjacent to or within the 100year floodplain shall be in accordance with the towns flood damage prevention ordinance the subdivision ordinance and the engineering design standards a floodplain development permit and

intent the town of little elm encourages the use of detention basins based for the benefits of the community outlined below a control of flood discharges the intent of detention basin design shall be to reduce flood discharges for the ultimate watershed development conditions without increasing peak discharges above the peak discharges for undeveloped watershed conditions this storage method serves as a key strategy of the stormwater management plan b environment as development occurs there is a loss of wildlife and bird life habitat it is possible to create a natural microenvironment around ponds that can offset this loss of habitat these natural environmental pockets in conjunction with natural open space areas can help maintain the rural setting of the town detention ponds also benefit downstream water quality by allowing the sedimentation of pollutants c recreation detention basins offer many recreational opportunities in an urban setting  for example a normally dry detention basin could be used for athletic fields or picnic areas while the banks of a pond offer valuable park space d aesthetics as an integral part of the town of little elm a detention basin needs to blend into the landscape and into the community measures such as gentle side slopes planting of trees and shrubs and other landscaping features can transform the detention facility into an attractive amenity for the neighborhood 2 requirements a detailed engineering studies of the entire basin shall be required to evaluate the timing of hydrographs from regional and onsite facilities as

and specifications shall be borne by the developer and shall be furnished to the town engineer for their review and approval storage  general stormwater management programs aimed at controlling increased stream water runoff generated by development are a top priority in urban watershed planning more frequent flooding increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff increased stream channel erosion and degradation increased sedimentation and increased water pollution are all problems intensified by increased stormwater runoff resulting from development storage of excess urban storm runoff is one of the most promising methods available in preventing urban flood damage 1 storm runoff storage with reduced release rates can hold downstream flood flows to within the safe conveyance capacity of the storm sewer and stream system in most cases it can be shown that storage is more economical than increasing downstream conveyance capacity storage facilities should be planned and designed to assure an effective and efficient operation and maintenance program 2 retention and detention are two generalized types of storm runoff storage used to control flooding retention storage refers to storm runoff collected and stored for a significant period and released or used after storm runoff has ended retention storage usually consists of wet reservoirs which often have agricultural recreational andor aesthetic value detention storage consists of reducing the rate of runoff for a short period of time to reduce peak flows by controlling the discharge outlet structure and by extending the period of runoff 3 skillful use of the procedures outlined in this section will provide reasonable solutions to drainage policy requirements individual and community experience in the use of these techniques will evolve into a methodology which will allow urban growth without the attendant drainage problems storage classification storage can be classified by location as follows a rainfall storage the storage of water near the point of rainfall occurrence or before storm runoff accumulates significantly rainfall storage is usually accomplished by roof top ponding parking lot ponding property line swale ponding and small onsite ponds b runoff storage water stored after storm runoff has accumulated significantly and begun to flow in a drainage system runoff storage is usually accomplished by off stream storage channel storage or onstream storage rainfall storage a rooftops the building codes require roof load design for rain and snow the design load may be converted to equivalent water depth in inches which can be safely contained on flat roofs the maximum storage allowed for design purposes should not exceed this depth unless a building is designed to withstand a greater roof load the depth of water can be controlled by proper sizing of downspouts and by constructing scuppers parapet walls b another method of achieving rooftop ponding involves placing loose gravel windrows or dikes a few inches in heights so that storm runoff is trapped as it moves toward the drainage outlet individual wedgeshaped ponds form behind the small dikes and slowly drain as the stormwater filters gravel this solution is of limited value however as there is no way to assure its permanence c the possibility of overflows exist and will occur quite often during major storms overflow drains should be used to protect against roof overloading periodic inspection and proper maintenance will reduce the possibility and the hazards of overflows d special attention must be given to the water tightness of the roof to assure that no leakage occurs due to the accumulation of water parking considerable area in urban development is occupied by parking lots if planned correctly these paved areas can provide adequate detention with minimum inconvenience to the public and without functional interference b there are two general methods of stormwater detention that can be utilized on parking areas one form involves the storage of runoff in depressions constructed near drains or outfall structures the second method of stormwater detention on parking lots consists of using the paved parking areas to channel stormwater to grassed or gravel filled areas for maximum infiltration and decrease in overland flow recreation areas a recreation areas such as sports fields generally have a substantial area of grass cover which often has a high infiltration rate storm runoff from such fields is minimal a secondary use of such recreation fields can be made by providing for limited detention storage of runoff from adjacent areas b since these areas are not used during periods of precipitation detention ponding should not seriously impede their primary use to minimize after effects the recreation area should be designed so that it will thoroughly drain in addition the vegetation used on the area should be tolerant of periodic inundation and wetness property line swales a subdivision planning and layout requires adequate surface drainage away from buildings this is obtained by sloping the finished grade in all directions away from the building the layout often calls for a swale to be located along the back property line which then drains longitudinally block where this is used the design shall include a concrete flume section with baffles to slow the flow of water yet maintain constant point for discharge b temporary ponding facilities along the rear lot line may include small controlled discharges along the back property line or if the subsoil conditions are favorable several inches of rainfall could be expected to percolate into the ground during and after a storm c prior to planning for property line swale ponding the engineer should determine that saturation of the subsoil will not have an adverse effect on building foundations in cases where significant subsoil problems exist water should not be ponded or percolated into the ground combinations in many instances one onsite detention method cannot conveniently or economically satisfy the required or needed amount of stormwater storage limitations in storage capacities site development conditions soils limitations and other related constraints may require that more than one method be utilized for example roof top parking lot and surface pond storage might all be required to compensate for the increase in runoff due to development of a particular site whatever combinations are suitable may be incorporated into a site development plan runoff storage a offstream storage the storage of water in depressed open areas in reservoirs and on low lying recreation fields to which storm peak flows are routed in usually termed offstream storage it is usually characterized by a side channel spillway or overflow from the main channel b channel storage although all channels inherently store water channels can be made to attenuate runoff by altering their hydraulic characteristics in a way that will reduce peak flows side channels that run essentially parallel to the main stream channel are also a means of temporarily storing water during excessive rainfall events c onstream storage the construction of an embankment across a channel so that a storage pond is formed represents onstream storage spillway considerations are important to pass large floods exceeding the storage capacity properly protected roadway embankments are well suited for this purpose d multipurpose use a rainfall storage and runoff storage systems are most practical when designed for multipurpose use for maximum land use efficiency the design engineer must consult early with the planning department and the parks and recreation department of the town b lower cost recreation making use of detention storage areas as parks and greenbelts ballfields and playing fields satisfies two needs and reduces the cost of each the minipark concept where small recreational areas are provided in neighborhoods within safe walking distances for children can be a typical joint effort of the drainage design engineer and the planning and recreational staffs of the town provisions must be made for maintenance of such areas c multiuse criteria the multiple use of storage areas is a field of endeavor where the fervent disciplines should develop desirable and acceptable criteria fitting the needs of the local community it is with storage including both detention and retention storage that an important potential exists for the reduction of flooding drainage costs and to some degree recreation costs hydraulic design criteria a general hydraulic and hydrologic design criteria provide the guidelines for design and construction of stormwater storage facilities these criteria are a necessary part of a stormwater management program needed to protect lowlying areas by preventing unacceptable increases in runoff rates as urban development progresses the engineer should be familiar with the drainage policy of this ordinance before considering the feasibility of a storm runoff detention facility existing land contours of the property should be a consideration in developing the drainage plan in many instances storage can be achieved economically by blocking the overland flow of stormwater runoff with various land forms curbs walls terraces and other means the amounts to designing a drainage system that will minimize the reduction in the critical time of concentration as the property is developed a drainage project located in a watershed that has a master plan may involve additional considerations which require review consultation with the town is essential to insure compliance with the overall watershed master plan b design factors and procedures before proceeding with engineering design of an onsite storage facility the physical and technical factors should be identified and the basic design procedures established a discussion of design factors and procedures follow 1 the drainage plans for a particular storage facility should include all property lines topography area location and all other items necessary to meet policy requirements outlined in the drainage policy for the town 2 care must be taken to locate layout and design the storage facility in a manner to insure safety and ease of maintenance c the rate of inflow to the storage facility inflow hydrographs and all hydrologic considerations must assume ultimate development of the sites contributing area several inflow hydrographs should be prepared to examine their effect on downstream flooding for the various design storm frequencies the number of inflow hydrographs to be provided may vary but should always adequately describe the range of flows expected for the design storm frequencies these various design storm inflow hydrographs and an acceptable flood routing procedure will be necessary in sizing the outlet works for the storage facility an emergency spillway should be provided to pass runoff that exceeds the design capacity of the detention facility d the maximum allowable release rate from a storage facility is selected after careful review of runoff rates for all pertinent storms as a minimum the pertinent design storm frequencies should include the 10 25 and 100year events however specific site conditions may require that additional consideration be given a particular area the town engineering department should be contacted to identify special design conditions the maximum allowable peak flow released from a particular site is selected to comply with the policy section of this manual in all cases the maximum release rate should be calculated using the hydraulic gradient created when the storage area is being utilized at full capacity e key items to consider in determining the maximum allowable release rate are a the peak flow rates for the various design storm frequencies prior to development b the capacity of the downstream stormwater channel or storm sewer c compliance with a master plan for the watershed if one exists d problems if any that are created onsite by the storage of stormwater runoff e potential problems created downstream when the onsite storage capacity is fully utilized and the excess runoff flows overland into downstream areas f the stormwater storage volume required is given by the maximum difference at any time between cumulative total inflow volume and cumulative outflow volume measured from the beginning of inflow for a 25year storm the maximum allowable release rate is not to be exceeded by the outflow peak discharge g the outfall or outlet structures should be designed on the basis of inlet or outlet control whichever is applicable the structures should be capable of safely and properly passing the flow range of design storm frequencies including the 100year storm without causing downstream flooding or exceeding the maximum allowable release rate outlet works must also pass all of the runoff from the 100year design storm within a reasonable length of time or a permit may be required from the texas commission on environmental quality tceq wet ponds will in many cases also require a permit from the tceq h special attention should be given to the provision of an emergency or overflow spillway which would pass excess flows greater than those of the 25year design storm and overflows caused by clogging of the principal outlets downstream watershed considerations such as the potential loss of life and damage to property due to overtopping or failure of the structure and the storage facilities area and capacity dictate the emergency spillway design storm it is advisable to contact the state agencies such as the texas water development board twdb and the tceq when planning a storage facility in order to meet their criteria i surfaces shall be faced with embedded rock or aggregate masonry bare concrete shall only be permitted with the express written permission of the town council side slopes should be no steeper than  where feasible for reasons of public safety and maintenance h hydraulic design methods a general the two basic methods suggested for predicting the volume of runoff with time and the peak flow rate are the rational method and the standard method the standard method is best suited for storage analysis of urban runoff but for relatively small drainage areas some form of the rational method if generally acceptable b rational method storage analysis when designing storage facilities for an area smaller than 400 acres it is often justifiable to use the rational method to compute the design inflow hydrographs this method relies heavily upon personal judgment but it is relatively simple and can give acceptable results if proper procedures are followed there are several different techniques of employing the rational method that may be used 1 one of the rational method techniques has been utilized by the federal aviation agency in designing airport drainage facilities the procedure is presented in airport drainage prepared by the federal aviation agency faa 1966 the faa technique is basically a graphical procedure which represents the cumulative storm runoff volume and the cumulative volume released from the storage facility outlet structure as functions of time the maximum difference between the two volume curves represents the required storage volume of the storage basin the procedure will consistently result in under designed storage facilities if a constant release rate is assumed from time zero this is caused by sizing the outlet pipe using the manning equation and not recognizing the stagedischarge relationship a reservoir routing technique unitizing the stagedischarge relationship of the storage facility should be used 2 it is recommended that in most instances the contributing drainage area not be more than 25 acres when using this technique 3 a second technique that employs the rational method is referred to as the modified rational method analysis this technique manipulates the rational method to reflect the fact that storms with durations greater than the normal time of concentration for a basin will result in a larger volume of runoff even though the pear peak discharge is reduced even though rainfall intensities and resulting peak discharges associated with longer duration storms are less than those for short duration storms the inflow may still be considerably greater than the outflow thus requiring more storage than in the case of shorter higher intensity storms 4 this approach becomes more valid on progressively smaller basins the technique should therefore be limited to relatively small areas such as parking lots roof tops or other upstream facilities with contributing areas less than 25 acres i detention facilities a intent the town of little elm encourages the use of detention basins based on the multifaceted benefits of the community outlined below b control of flood discharges the intent of detention basin storage design shall be to reduce flood discharges for the ultimate watershed development conditions without increasing peak discharges above the peak discharges for undeveloped watershed conditions this storage method serves as a key strategy for the stormwater management plan c environment as development occurs there is a loss of wildlife and bird life habitat it is possible to create a natural microenvironment around ponds that can offset this loss of habitat these natural environmental pockets in conjunction with natural open space areas can help maintain the rural setting of the town detention ponds also benefit downstream water quality by allowing the sedimentation of pollutants d recreation detention basins offer many recreational opportunities in an urban setting  for example a normally dry detention basin could be used for athletic fields or picnic areas while the banks of the pond offer valuable park space e aesthetics as an integral part of the town of little elm a detention basin needs to blend into the landscape and into the community simple yet inexpensive measures such as gentle side slopes planting of trees and shrubs and other landscaping features can transform the detention facility into an attractive amenity for the neighborhood f requirements 1 detailed engineering studies of the entire basin shall be required to evaluate the timing of hydrographs from regional and onsite facilities as well as backwater calculations to determine the effect of the detentionretention facilities on upstream water surface elevations 2 all detention facility designs shall be performed by a professional engineer registered in the state of texas and shall meet the requirements of permanent rule 31 texas administration tac other requirements as applicable 3 the minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall be that volume required to reduce runoff rate to the undeveloped condition rate dedicated detention basins shall also include an additional one foot of freeboard and two feet of sediment storage the volume of runoff storage for drainage areas greater than 160 acres shall be compared using unit hydrograph procedures acceptable unit hydrograph procedures include the soil conservation service dimension less unit hydrograph and snyders unit hydrograph manual methods or use of the computer programs tr20 hec1 and nudallas are allowed for runoff hydrograph computation and flood routings the criteria contained in this section shall serve as the minimum requirements for detention basin design for drainage areas less than 160 acres the above methods are recommended  however an approximate routing method may be used subject to approval of the town engineer 4 the maximum allowable release rate from any site shall be equal to the 100year peak runoff rate prior to site development the maximum design release rate may be less 5 where stormwater management improvements are required in the natural floodway or a permanent greenbelt or open space area they should be incorporated into existing lakes or they should be designed in as small an area as feasible to create natural contours note however that detention basins or retention ponds shall be a minimum of one acre in size to allow for proper maintenance side slopes and outlet work operation 6 retentiondetention ponds shall resemble natural ponds  in addition 1 the pond should expand gradually from the inlet towards the outlet insuring that there are no dead zones that is water entering the pond gradually spread out and uniformly displaces the water already present in the pond 2 the lengthtowidth ratio should be three to one or greater to provide a long flow path 3 the average permanent pond depth should be greater than five feet where possible 4 a ten to 20foot wide shallow bench shall be provided along the shores of the permanent pond for safety and to encourage the development of bottom growth in these areas this vegetation will enhance the biologic treatment characteristics of the pond and also enhance the natural appearance of the pond 5 if several ponds are required they should vary in size and shape and be separated by tree groves vegetated berms or similar screening of a natural appearance 6 landscape materials should enhance wildlife habitat where feasible 7 where slope erosion protection is needed for the side slopes of a pond rock or geotextiles are required as approved by the town engineer exposed concrete sic g detention facilities of less than ten acrefeet of flood storage shall have outlet structures designed for the 100year frequency storm facilities

requirements section texas construction general permit cgp construction activities that discharge stormwater runoff into or adjacent to any surface water of the state are regulated by the state of texas under the construction general permit cgp txr150000 the governing agency is the texas commission on environmental quality tceq construction activities are regulated according to the area of land disturbed large construction activities for sites that disturb five or more acres or are part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb five or more acres and meet the definition of an operator the following applies 1 prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan sw3p 2 post a site notice 3 submit a copy of the site notice to the ms4 operator for sites that disturb five or more acres and meet the definition of a primary operator the following applies 1 prepare and implement a sw3p 2 submit a notice of intent noi to tceq 3 post the noi and site notice 4 submit a copy of the noi to ms4 operator small construction activities for sites that disturb at least one but less than five acres or are part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb at least one but less than five acres and meet the definition of an operator the following applies 1 prepare and implement a sw3p 2 post a site notice 3 submit a copy of the site notice to the ms4 operator sites that disturb less than one acre and that are not part of a larger common plan of development that would disturb one or more acres are not required to have coverage under the general permit refer to the general permit definitions for operator and primary operator additional information on the texas construction general permit can be found at the following link  storm water pollution prevention plan sw3p one of the requirements of the construction general permit is to develop an sw3p in accordance with cgp and the sw3p guidance policy for the town of little elm the purpose of the sw3p is to provide guidelines for minimizing sediment and other pollutants that may originate on the site from flowing into municipal storm systems or jurisdictional waters during construction the plan must also address the principal activities known to disturb significant amounts of ground surface during construction the stormwater management controls included in the sw3p should focus on providing control of pollutant discharges with practical approaches that use readily available techniques expertise materials and equipment the sw3p must be implemented prior to the start of construction activity construction controls structural and nonstructural controls may be used for controlling pollutants for stormwater discharges from small and large sites structural controls shall comply with details and specifications in the latest edition of the nctcog iswm technical manual and these standards when the nctcog manual and these standards are in conflict these standards shall govern the following are acceptable temporary controls for use during construction nonstructural minimizing the area of disturbance preserving existing vegetation structural silt fence inlet protection rock check dams stabilized construction entrances sediment traps vegetated buffer strips temporary detention structure rock check dams hydromulch suggested construction controls can be found on the nctcog iswm website it is the responsibility of the design engineer to select and design appropriate construction controls for each site if the most appropriate control is not shown in the iswm technical manual the design engineer shall submit calculations and references for design of the control to the department of engineering services for review and approval waste and hazardous material controls covered containers shall be provided for waste construction materials and daily trash hazardous materials shall be stored in a manner that prevents contact with rainfall and runoff onsite fuel tanks and other containers of motor vehicle fluids shall be placed in a bermed area with a liquidtight liner or be provided with other secondary containment and spill prevention controls the sw3p shall require federal state and local reporting of any spills and releases of hazardous materials greater than the regulated reportable quantity rq and reporting to engineering services of all spills and releases to the storm drainage system temporary stabilization a portions of a site that have been disturbed but where no work will occur for more than 21 days shall be temporarily stabilized as soon as practicable and no later than 14 days except when precluded by seasonal arid conditions or prolonged drought b temporary stabilization shall consist of providing a protective cover designed to reduce erosion on disturbed areas temporary stabilization may be achieved using temporary seeding soil retention blankets hydromulches and other techniques that cover 100 percent of the disturbed areas until either final stabilization can be achieved or until further construction activities take place c perimeter controls such as silt fence vegetated buffer strips or other similar perimeter controls are intended to act as controls when stabilization has not occurred perimeter controls may remain in place during temporary stabilization final stabilization final stabilization consists of soil cover such as vegetation geotextiles mulch rock or placement of pavement for stabilizing vegetated drainageways sod or seeded soil retention blankets shall be used hydromulch will not be allowed in vegetated swales channels or other drainageways the plan for final stabilization shall be coordinated with permanent controls in the swmp and with the landscaping plan if applicable notice of intent noi if applicable copies of the noi shall be sent to the public works department at least two days prior to construction the noi may be emailed to ms4@littleelmorg tceq site notice a signed copy of the construction site notice shall be posted at the construction site in a location where it is readily viewed by the general public during all construction activity notice of termination not all parties that submitted a noi shall submit a not within 30 days after final stabilization is established when the owner of a residential subdivision transfers ownership of individual lots to builders before final stabilization is achieved the sw3p shall include controls for each individual lot in lieu of final stabilization these controls shall consist of stabilization of the rightofway and placement of structural controls at the low point of each individual lot or equivalent measures to retain soil on each lot during construction all temporary controls must be removed prior to submitting the not additionally the builder must submit a valid noi before an not can be submitted by the owner inspection and maintenance during construction 1 the owner shall construct all controls required by the sw3p the owner shall have qualified personnel inspect the controls every seven days with no additional inspections after rain events an alternative method may be used as long as it is in accordance with the cgp 2 certified inspection reports shall be retained as part of the sw3p within seven days of the inspection controls identified as damaged or deteriorated shall be repaired or replaced as appropriate controls shall also be routinely cleaned to maintain adequate capacity 3 changes or additions shall be made to the controls within seven days to prevent discharges from the site the owner shall implement procedures to remove discharged soil from all portions of the storm drainage system including streets gutters inlets storm drain channels creeks ponds etc 4 notes requiring the inspection and maintenance shall be placed on sw3p drawings the sw3p shall identify the responsible party for inspecting and maintaining each control if no party is identified each owner and operator that submitted a noi for the site shall be fully responsible for implementing all requirements of the sw3p construction and maintenance the owner shall submit an erosion control plan and
