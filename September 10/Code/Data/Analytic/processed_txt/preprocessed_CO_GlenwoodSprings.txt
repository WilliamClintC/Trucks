every street and street repair situation is unique design criteria and construction standards cannot address every situation but in order to maintain some form of consistency these standards have been developed in most cases they provide the minimum acceptable standards for construction or repair consequently when strictly applied they will provide the minimum acceptable product therefore this criteria has been developed to maintain the same integrity of the street pavement and subsurface condition prior to its being cut for utility installations 2 to achieve the goal of quality or excellence in street repairs these criteria shall be viewed as standards when used in conjunction with good planning and judgment this will restore the street to an acceptable condition with minimal patching failures in most cases it will be necessary to exceed the minimum standards to achieve a quality repair 3 issues that shall be considered in a quality approach to street repairs are contained in this section b appearance  does the final appearance of the street suggest the repairs were planned or that they happened by accident 1 consciously or not the driving public rates the appearance of the street system including street repairs every day street repairs which are satisfactory from a functional point of view may produce a negative reaction from the public if they give the appearance of being poorly planned or executed 2 the publics perception of street repairs is based primarily on shape size and orientation  the geometry of a patch the following are some standards for the geometry of a quality patch a existing pavements should be removed to clean straight lines parallel and perpendicular to the flow of traffic do not construct patches with angled sides and irregular shapes b avoid patches within existing patches if this cannot be avoided make the boundaries of the patches coincide c do not leave strips of pavement less than onehalf 12 a lane in width from the edge of the new patch to the edge of an existing patch or the lip of the gutter d in concrete pavements remove sections to existing joints in the case of concrete in good repair in damaged concrete the limits of removal should be determined in the field by a representative of the city engineer e asphalt and concrete pavements should be removed by saw cutting or grinding avoid breaking away the edges of the existing pavement or damaging the remaining pavement with heavy construction equipment f in the case of a series of patches or patches for service lines off a main trench repair the pavement over the patches by grinding and overlay when the spacing between the patches is less than seventyfive 75 feet in cases where the existing pavement is in poor condition and may require overlay within the next few years this requirement may be modified or waived by the city engineer c rideability  are the transitions on and off of the repair smooth does the patch itself offer a smooth ride are the joints located outside of the normal wheel path 1 completed street repairs should have rideability at least as good as if not better than the pavement prior to the repairs a driver may be able to see a street repair but in the case of a quality repair heshe should not be able to feel it in driving normally down the street 2 do not place overlays with feathered edges on streets of any classification overlays should be placed by first removing the existing pavement to the desired depth by grinding and then placing the pavement flush with the adjacent surfaces 3 surface tolerances for street repairs should meet the standard for new construction that is the finished surface of the street repair when tested with a tenfoot straightedge parallel to the center line or perpendicular across joints will show variations measured from the testing face of the straightedge to the surface of the street repair which do not exceed onequarter 14 inch d pavement management  is the repair consistent with the longterm pavement management strategy for the particular street 1 street repairs should leave a pavement in a condition at least as good as if not better than the condition prior to the repairs 2 in most cases and particularly in the cases of extensive excavation and repairs it is desirable to survey the existing pavement condition with a representative of the city prior to the work after completion of the work survey the pavement condition again to verify that the pavement condition has been maintained or improved a in the case of minor repairs these pavement surveys can be made by visual observation b however in the case of major projects that involve excessive haul of materials or unusually heavy construction equipment or activity nondestructive testing of the pavement condition before and after construction is required 3 consideration of pavement management issues may also identify opportunities for joint efforts between the utilities and the city for example suppose that the repair of a utility line requires an overlay on onehalf 12 of a street and that the condition of the remaining onehalf 12 of the street might also warrant an overlay we may decide at that point to overlay the entire street with the citys street authority and the utility splitting the cost of the overlay in such a case the utility may be able to save the cost of grinding onehalf 12 the street the citys street authority will allocate a reasonable percentage of its annual overlay program to accommodate its share of these situations this includes minor twotothreeblock maintenance projects and larger capital improvement projects major water line extension coordination for these types of cooperative repairs should occur as far in advance of actual construction as possible a transverse patches on arterial and collector streets shall be overlaid across the entire street width for a distance of two 2 feet minimum on all sides of the trench b do not allow the edges of patches to fall in existing wheel paths the edges of patches parallel to the direction of traffic shall be limited to the boundaries of lanes or to the center line of travel lanes c patches should have a smooth longitudinal grade consistent with the existing roadway patches should also have a crossslope or crosssection consistent with the design of the existing roadway e future maintenance  will the repair pose any future maintenance problems or make future maintenance more difficult 1 excavations and street repairs even wellconstructed street repairs shorten a pavements life several types of street distress settlement alligator cracking and potholes often show up around patches quality street repairs should attempt to reduce the occurrence of these types of distress 2 avoid weakening or destroying the existing pavement around an excavation with heavy construction equipment stockpiling or delivery of materials etc when damage does occur remove the damaged pavement extending the limits of the street repair before replacing the pavement remember no stockpiling of backfill or roadbuilding materials is permitted on the pavement a when the proposed excavation falls within ten 10 feet of a section of failed pavement the failed area shall be removed to sound pavement and patched scarring gouging or other damaged pavement adjacent to a patch shall be removed and the pavement repaired b in the case of older pavement where the likelihood of cracking and potholes next to the patch is greater it may be necessary to extend the shoulders of the pavement beyond the twofoot minimum and reinforce this area with a geotextile t cutting is required for all repairs c for patches in asphalt a tack coat shall be applied to all edges of the existing asphalt before placing the new pavement after placing the new asphalt all seams joints between the new and existing pavements shall be sealed with an asphalt tack coat or rubberized crack seal material d avoid frequent changes in width of patches for future maintenance this simplifies removal of adjacent pavement failures 502  1   testing a description  the contractor is required to provide material testing for each phase of the work and at no cost to the city the independent geotechnical testing firm chosen to perform this work for the contractor must be qualified and identified on the
