will require that volumes and rates be controlled so that after development the site will generate no greater peak runoff from the site than experienced prior to development for a twoyear tenyear and onehundredyear storm considered individually consideration of a waiver or reduction of this requirement will be given by the township board for sites adjacent to a watercourse where a hydrologic study indicates that detention will have a detrimental effect on downstream properties 2 these design storms shall be defined as either a twentyfourhour storm using the rainfall distribution recommended by the us soil conservation service when using us soil conservation service procedures such as us soil conservation service urban hydrology for small watersheds technical release no 55 or as the estimated total rainfall uniformly throughout the critical storm duration which may equal or exceed the estimated time of concentration at the site when using a design method such as the rational method or modified rational method 3 for purposes of computing runoff all undeveloped or unpaved lands eg cultivated pasture wooded or grassy in the site shall be assumed prior to development to be in good hydrologic condition regardless of conditions existing at the time of computation for lands to be considered cultivated they shall have been used for such purposes uninterruptedly for a period of at least 7 of the last 10 years prior to the time of computation if such uninterrupted use has not occurred or cannot be satisfactorily documented woods shall be assume to be the predeveloped land condition of the undeveloped or unpaved lands 4 any major agricultural development as defined in the ordinance shall be submitted to the morris county soil conservation district for review and comment in accordance with this ordinance and any soil conservation district guidelines a township board may condition approval of such stormwater control measures upon a positive approval of the morris county soil conservation district 5 soil erosion and sediment control shall be provided in accordance with standards for soil erosion and sediment control promulgated by the state soil conservation committee pursuant to njsa 42 administered by the morris county soil conservation district b water quality control  in order to provide sediment transport and particulate contaminant pollution control from stormwater runoff all site development stormwater management plans must provide for the control of a water quality design storm the water quality  15605 general provisions  15605  design storm shall be defined as either the oneyear frequency twentyfourhour storm using the rainfall distribution recommended for new jersey by the us soil conservation service or a storm of 125 inches of rainfall falling uniformly in two hours the water quality design storm shall be controlled by one of the following practices 1 the water quality requirement for detention will require prolonged detention of the runoff from the water quality design storm provisions shall be made for it to be detained and released so as to evacuate 90% of the design storm stormwater runoff to the basin in 18 hours in the case of residential development and 36 hours in the case of all other developments the detention time shall be considered a drawdown time of the elected water quality design storm and therefore shall begin at the time of peak storage of that storm drawdown time means the time for a detention basin to translate from a peak storage condition for the water quality design storm maximum detention basin stage for that storm to a time at which 90% of the volume of design storm runoff stored has evacuated basin evacuation shall be a gradual translation if the above requirement would result in flow outlet smaller than three inches in diameter the period of detention shall be waived so that three inches will be the minimum outlet size used in the case of wet detention basins the permanent storage water shall not be included in the analysis 2 where soils have sufficient permeability the production of zero runoff from the site under conditions of the 125 inch water quality storm will be considered sufficient to meet the water quality requirement for residential developments provided that the seasonal high ground water does not rise to within four feet of the bottom of the detention facility in this situation the detention facility is functioning as a retention facility however a retention facility cannot be applied on sites where subsurface conditions allow for rapid infiltration for other than residential developments approvals will be on a casebycase basis after technical review by the township engineer the object of this review will be to avoid the potential for contamination of ground water other technology may be substituted pursuant to below c in all cases multiple level outlets or other fully automatic outlets shall be designed so that peak discharge rates from the development for the design storms will not be increased from what would occur if the development were not constructed outlet waters shall be discharged from the development at such locations and velocities as not to cause additional erosion or additional channels downstream of the development and shall be in  15605 pequannock code  15605  accordance with standards for soil erosion and sediment control administered by the morris county soil conservation district d where the project consists of two phases i new construction which requires provisions of storm drainage under the terms of this ordinance and ii repair or rehabilitation of existing structures and surfaces which does not result in increasing the extent of impervious areas or in rendering existing surfaces less pervious the detention requirements may be computed on the basis of phase i exclusively e if detention basins or other detention facilities are provided water passes at times other than following rainfall the township engineer shall be consulted concerning design criteria it will become necessary for detention requirements to be met despite the necessity of passing certain low flows this applies to all onstream or online detention basins f detention basins located in freshwater wetlands may be allowed only in accordance with the freshwater wetlands protection act njsa b1 et seq and any rules adopted pursuant thereto g any detention facility that impounds water use of an artificial dike levee or other barrier and raises the water level five feet or more above the usual mean low water height when measured from the downstream toeofdam to the emergency spillway crest is classified as a dam and subject to the new jersey dam safety standards njac  all such dams must be designed constructed operated and maintained in compliance with the rules of njac  h in many instances the provision of separate detention facilities for a number of single sites may be more expensive and more difficult to maintain than provision of joint regional facilities for a number of sites in such cases the applicant or applicants may seek approval under this ordinance of joint regional detention facilities which will fulfill the requirements of this ordinance however compliance with this ordinance must be achieved and may not be postponed ii planning and design standards for maintenance and repair a the goal for the planning and design of a stormwater management facility is for its operation with the least practical amount of maintenance to accomplish this the facility shall be developed to eliminate avoidable maintenance tasks minimize the long term amount of regular maintenance facilitate the performance of required maintenance tasks and reduce the potential for extensive difficult and costly remedial or emergency maintenance efforts b strong durable and noncorrodible materials components and fasteners shall be used to reduce required maintenance efforts these include but are not limited to lightweight noncorrodible  15605 general provisions  15605  metals such as aluminum for trash racks orifice plates and access hatches  hardy disease resistant grasses for bottoms and side slopes as prescribed by soil erosion and sediment control standards administered by the morris county soil conservation district  reinforced concrete for outlet structures and inlet headwalls  and gabions for channel and outlet linings c detention or retention facilities shall be designed to minimize propagation of insects particularly mosquitoes d detention or retention facilities should be designed in a harmonious and attractive manner e detention facility outlets shall be designed to function without manual electric or mechanical controls iii design standards all elements of a stormwater management facility which includes the collection system as well as the detention or retention basin shall be designed in accordance with accepted standards and approved by the township engineer a estimation of stormwater runoff quantities  the following are some of the accepted methods for the estimation of stormwater runoff quantities 1 rational method the rational method is based on the rational formula q   cia where q   peak rate of runoff or discharge in cfs c   runoff coefficient i   intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for the time of concentration tc of the drainage area a   drainage basin area in acres the rational method is acceptable for estimating stormwater runoff quantities for drainage basins up to an area of five acres the applicant shall determine the variables such as runoff coefficient time of concentration and rainfall intensity which shall be subject to approval of the township engineer runoff coefficients and the estimation of the time of concentration are discretionary but subject to the approval of the township engineer 2 modified rational method the modified rational method is an expansion of the rational method which utilizes the same equation and variables previously explained this method is acceptable for estimating stormwater runoff in basins up to an area of 25 acres 3 usda soil conservation service scs tr55 runoff curve number method this method is published by the usda soil conservation service in technical release no 55 tr55 which requires the determination of a runoff curve number this number designates the hydrologic soil group of the watershed which is dependent upon soil and ground cover  15605 pequannock code  15605  conditions and is subject to the approval of the township

satisfactorily and safely in passing the twoyear tenyear and onehundredyear design storms at a rate not to exceed that of the same design storm under a predeveloped condition an acceptable hydraulic design method must be used to mathematically route the designed storms proposed basin there are many accepted hydraulic methods for detention basin routing one being the storage indication modifiedpuls method this method uses the continuity equation which may be expressed as where  i   mean inflow into basin during routing period wt o   mean outflow from basin during routing period wt ws   change in basin storage during routing period wt the routing procedure is as follows  plot a hydrograph of predevelopment conditions from which the maximum basin outflow is determined  plot a postdevelopment hydrograph which is to be routed proposed detention basin  assume a size and shape for the first trial basin and outlet works  compute a table andor curve of water depth versus storage a function of basin geometry water depth is measured above the spillway or outflow pipe invert  15605 general provisions  15605   compute a table andor curve of water depth versus outflow stage discharge relationships are a function of the outlet structure  select a routing period t such that there are five or six points on the rising side of the inflow hydrograph one of which coincides with the inflow peak  construct a graph of 2s t + 0 versus 0 s   storage volume t   outing period 0   outflow rate the routing procedure is now accomplished using a tabular method for the solution of the modifiedpuls equation  compare the maximum outflow rate with the allowable rate of discharge from the drainage area  adjust size shape andor outlet structure if the maximum outflow rate is greater
