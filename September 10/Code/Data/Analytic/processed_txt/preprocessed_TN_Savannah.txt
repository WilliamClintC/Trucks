district or changes to an existing pud ordinance shall be considered an amendment to the zoning chapter and shall be administered and processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter 2 purpose the purpose of this section is to encourage the development of various type planned developments under a single master plan where the traditional density bulk spacing and use regulations of all other zoning designations which may be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed areas may impose inappropriate and unduly rigid restrictions upon the development of parcels or areas which lend themselves to a unified planned approach these districts are intended to promote flexibility in site planning and structure location to facilitate the provision of utilities and circulation systems as well as to preserve the natural and scenic features of the parcel all planned developments should be designed to ensure that the following general goals are achieved a the proposed development shall be of such design that will efficiently use available land and will protect and preserve to the greatest extent possible natural features of the land such as trees streams

serve as the minimum requirements a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with e and 1840211f as allowed at 40 cfr 4036c b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users as allowed at 40 cfr4036c2 c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the control authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with tennessee rule 04004014065 1850 d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this allowed at 40 cfr 40315 i categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph ii of this met ii criteria a either 1 the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or 2 the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease etc shall not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority the city may establish equivalent mass 1851 limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in eia eie below i to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ii an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 18 40211eic of this notification of a revised production rate the control authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs 1840211eia of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit iii when developing equivalent mass limits the control authority a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration18 52 based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to  the industrial user must also be in compliance with regarding the prohibition of bypass f the control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the control authority when converting such limits the control authority will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by of this see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the control authority will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this 1840211 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the control authority within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the control authority of such 1853 anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate 12 modification of national pretreatment standards if the potw achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by the national pretreatment standards the city may apply to the approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the national pretreatment standards consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the potw to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninetyfive 95

damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of bypass sever property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements  a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this c bypass notification i if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the

basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four 24 hours 1886 d prohibition of bypass i bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take enforcement action against the user for a bypass unless a the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or sever property damage  b there was no feasible alternative to the bypass including the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenances during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user properly notified the control

regulations i  3 subdivision regulations savannah municipalregional planning commission savannah tennessee   amended article i general provisions a purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore to the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivision be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards the following subdivision standards guiding the planning commission are designed to secure a coordinated layout with adequate provisions for traffic light air recreation transportation water drainage and sanitary facilities and services  to promote a distribution of population and traffic which will tend to create conditions favorable to health safety convenience and prosperity the following regulations set forth the minimum standards to be adhered to by developers of lands for residential commercial and industrial uses and to provide a guide for the planning commission and other city officials exercising their duties pertaining to the review approval and administration of land subdivision development within the jurisdiction of the the savannah planning region b authority these subdivision regulations and the procedures and standards set forth herein are adopted by the savannah municipalregional planning commission under authority granted by tennessee the planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such standards having filed a certified copy of the major road plan in the office of the registrar of hardin county tennessee savannah subdivision regulations i  4 c jurisdiction these regulations shall govern all subdivision of land outside of the corporate limits of savannah located within the savannah planning region for the purpose of these regulations planning region shall refer to this area within these regulations the term subdivision shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two 2 or more lots sites or other divisions requiring new street or utility construction or any division of less than five 5 acres for the purpose whether immediate or future of sale or building development and includes resubdivision and when appropriate to the context relates to the process of resubdividing or to the land or area subdivided any owner of land within the planning region wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the city of savannah an application for subdivision according to the procedures outlined in which submittal shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in a copy of the certified deed shall be presented with the application for subdivision in instances where the subdivider is not the owner a letter

savannah municipalregional planning commission to encourage subdivision development which enhances the health safety and welfare of the community and which optimizes the use of the land while providing a prudent balance between the economic considerations of the developer and the public interest conversely it shall be the policy of the planning commission to disapprove proposed subdivision development which is deemed to be inefficient use of land inconsistent with the needs and character of the community economically untimely or otherwise not in the public interest further it shall be the policy of the savannah municipalregional planning commission to consider each proposed subdivision development on its merits in context with existing or planned land use population and traffic distribution and the needs and best interest of the community  consequently the mere compliance with the minimum standards set forth in these regulations does not grant to the developer an implicit or explicit right to subdivision approval  accordingly the planning commission may require that a proposed subdivision development exceed the minimum standards to satisfy site peculiar conditions or to

the subdivision will be considered a minor subdivision vertical contour lines of not more than five 5 fee shall be required on any minor subdivision plat submitted in which five 5 or more lots are being created the procedure for approval of a minor subdivision plat shall consist of presenting a final plat per of this article g two lot subdivisions whenever a subdivision meets the criteria described below the secretary of the municipalregional planning commission may approve a subdivided plat without the approval of the planning commission 1 the divided tract involves no more than two 2 lots 2 the planning staff of the planning commission certifies that the subdivision meets all the regulations adopted by the planning commission and  3 no request for variance from the adopted regulations of the planning commission has been made savannah subdivision regulations iii  1 article iii general requirements and standards of design a general design concepts land subdivision design is a compromise among competing and often conflicting objectives users of these regulations should recognize that land subdivision is far more than a means of marketing land  it is primarily the first step in the process of building a community once land has been divided into lots streets established utilities installed and buildings constructed correction of defects is costly and difficult moreover the development pattern is permanently ingrained in the community and unlikely to be changed ultimately subdivided land becomes a public responsibility requiring the maintenance of improvements and the provisions of public services additionally for the sake of future owners and the community subdivided lands should not only be presently marketable but should remain competitive with future developments thereby presenting a stable and liquid investment therefore the interests of the public the developer and future owners are served by adherence to sound concepts and standards of design to achieve the desired objectives all subdivisions within the savannah planning region must conform to the following four 4 basic design concepts 1 external factors subdivision design must provide for external factors of communitywide concern including the proper extension of major streets extensions of utilities preservation of major drainage channels and related floodlands the reservation of needed school and park sites and the preservation of sanitary services additional external factors to be considered include proximity to local community and regional shopping centers  to places of employment  to educational and recreational facilities  and to public transportation 2 land use subdivision design must be related to the proposed and existing land uses the layout of a subdivision is inseparable from the use to which the land is to be put moreover adjacent land use patterns must be considered some uses such as parks certain institutional uses and bodies of surface water may be used in the design to create value others such as railroads power lines and associated easements poorly subdivided lands and unsightly strip commercial developments may require special design techniques to minimize their depreciatory effect on property values savannah subdivision regulations iii  2 3 natural environment subdivision design must give due consideration to the natural environment areas of natural beauty such as fine stands of trees and prominent terrain should be conserved by the design low areas subject to flooding or areas of unsuitable soil or ground water conditions should be avoided and not be put to enclosed uses the disposal of sewage and the preservation of ground water shall be considered paramount in the development of property in the savannah planning region 4 internal details subdivision design must give attention to internal design details including the proper layout of the streets utilities needed open space and adjustment of the design to topography and soil capabilities of the land a major aspect of internal detailing is careful attention to drainage b water drainage storm water drainage is a major aspect of land subdivision design  however it should not dominate over other important design considerations nevertheless considerable attention must be given to drainage design because of the potentially disastrous effects on life and property resulting from defective design accordingly no land subdivision shall be approved within the savannah planning region unless a detailed drainage plan for such subdivision has been submitted to and approved by technical review staff andor the planning commission the following principles are to be applied to all drainage design for land subdivision within the savannah planning region 1 internal regulation of drainage the rate at which water is discharged from all sources leaving a subdivision or other developed areas shall not be increased by more than 10% after development than before development unless approved by designated technical review staff or the planning commission 2 drainage system design the storm water drainage system shall consist of a major and a minor element the major element which will operate infrequently shall be designed to prevent the loss of life and significant property damage from any reasonable foreseeable rainfall event the minor element operating savannah subdivision regulations iii  3 frequently shall provide for an acceptable degree of convenient access to property during and after frequent normal rainfall events c street layout the layout or arrangement of streets is the singularly most important aspect of subdivision design to a large extent it determines the effectiveness of the drainage system additionally the street layout determines the shape size and orientation of building sites and to a major extent the character and beauty of residential neighborhoods and the attractiveness of nonresidential developments 1 conformity to the major street plan the location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major street plan and any other plans of the city of savannah 2 relation to adjoining street system the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining subdivisions or their proper projection when adjoining property is not subdivided the width shall be the same or greater than the existing street but in no case less than the minimum width required the arrangement of streets shall be such as to provide for future extension of utilities and storm water drainage to prevent creation of severed parcels of land and to cause no undue hardship on owners of adjoining properties 3 relation to existing topography the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall make optimum use of the existing natural topography by designing the layout around the natural drainage routing and by carefully adjusting the streets to the topography so as to minimize grading and drainage problems collector streets should generally follow valley lines land access streets should cross contours at right angles side hill street locations are to be avoided where possible 4 relation to land use density the arrangement of streets shall insofar as is practical optimize the total length of streets such that the cost per lot or building site for the construction and maintenance of streets underground utilities and other improvements are minimal the use of culdesacs in a subdivision may be an effective means of optimizing land use density relative to other improvements savannah subdivision regulations iii  4 5 relation of street elevation to drainage surface street elevation at all points shall be set to preclude periodic inundation due to the overflow of constructed or natural open channels or due to local storm water runoff which has a flow depth exceeding the curb height where in commercial and industrial areas extruded curb and in residential areas vditch are not installed no appreciable amount of runoff water shall be permitted on streets street elevation may be raised by fill embankment providing such embankment does not result in flooding of lots or building sites within the subdivision nor in increased flood heights upstream and downstream drainage openings embankments shall not impede the flow of water except where such embankment is an integral part of a planned detention basin requiring regulated outflow in no case shall flooding of residential lots or building sites be permitted by design 6 street rightofway street rightofway measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown on the major street plan and shall not be less than listed below in no case shall lots be reflected inclusive of dedicated right of way nor shall the street widths be modified solely for the purpose of increasing the area of marketable land nor to accommodate a land use which might otherwise be inappropriate a arterial  80150 feet arterial streets are major thoroughfares connecting neighborhoods and centers of commerce within the community or state wide  or as may be established by the tennessee department of transportation b collector  60 feet collector streets are those which provide major circulation within neighborhoods and carry traffic from local streets to arterial streets c local  50 feet local streets provide access from properties fronting thereon to collector or arterial streets moving traffic is a secondary function of local streets savannah subdivision regulations iii  5 d deadend street culdesac 100 feet culdesacs are permanent deadend streets or courts designed so that they cannot be extended in the future within the savannah corporate limits culdesacs or deadend streets shall not exceed 1200 feet in length and shall serve no more than 30 lots regardless of frontage widths deadend street shall not exceed 2000 feet in length and shall not serve more than 50 lots within savannahs planning region they shall be provided at the closed end with a right of wayproperty line radius of at least fifty 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least forty 40 feet amended  e temporary culdesacs  50 feet where in the opinion of the planning commission it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property such deadend streets having a length greater than two hundred 200 feet shall be provided with a temporary turn around of either a circular or backandturn design where deemed necessary by the planning commission adequate rights of way shall be dedicated to connect with any temporary deadend streets adjoining the subdivision 7 additional width on existing streets a the entire rightofway shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street streets designated as arterial or collector status streets on the savannah major road plan which do not have the minimum pavement widths shall have the additional pavement width and curb and gutter provided by the subdivider on both sides of the street b where the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street onehalf 12 of the required rightofway measured from the center line of the existing rightofway shall be provided streets designated as arterial or collector status streets on the savannah major road plan shall have the additional pavement width and curb and gutter added by the developer on the side of the street on which the subdivision is located savannah subdivision regulations iii  6 8 restriction of access a where a subdivision fronts on an arterial street or highway or where a nonresidential use abuts on a street opposite a residential use area the planning commission may require that frontage be provided on a marginal access street double frontage shall not be permitted between any residential or major street and a marginal access street b for residential subdivisions bordering on an arterial street or highway the planning commission may require in lieu of a marginal access street that  and corner lots be provided with double frontage on both the arterial street or highway and a minor residential street in this case the right of vehicular access to the arterial street or highway shall be permanently dissolved and such dissolution shall be noted permanently on the final plat of the subdivision 9 street alignment and grades in setting the alignment and grades for streets due consideration shall be given to storm drainage in general the depth of flow in gutters and the allowable spread of water shall be consistent with the functional classification of the street arterial streets shall be designed to remain virtually free of water deeper flows and wider spreads may be tolerated on collector and land access streets street alignments and grades shall be designed so that during severe rainfall events the collector and minor land access streets can serve as open channels supplementary to the normally piped storm drainage system without flooding the adjoining lots or building sites  therefore midblock sags in street grades are to be avoided and grades are to be set so as to generally parallel storm sewer gradients during frequent normal rainfall events appreciable runoff shall not be permitted to flow across intersections the rate of flow for runoff contained on streets shall not normally exceed ten 10 cubic feet per second 10 maximum street grades grades on arterial and collector streets shall not exceed seven 7 percent grades on all other streets shall not exceed ten 10 percent 11 horizontal curves where a deflection angle of more than ten 10 degrees in

be of standard parabolic design 13 intersections a the angle of intersection between two major streets or between a major street and a minor land access street shall generally be a right angle but in no case shall such intersection be less than eighty 80 degrees all other street intersections shall be as near a right angle as possible but in no case less than seventyfive 75 degrees b property line radii at street intersections involving an arterial or collector street shall be not less than thirtyfive 35 feet all other intersections shall have property line radii of not less than twentyfive 25 feet 14 tangents a tangent street segment shall be introduced between reverse or compound curves where necessary to provide a minimum sight distance of two hundred 200 feet between any two points

eighty 80 feet and a street rightofway diameter of at least one hundred 100 feet the planning commission may approve an alternate design to meet unusual site conditions b where the planning commission determines a need for future access to adjacent properties proposed subdivision streets shall be extended or additional street segments provided to the boundary of the subdivision at locations specified by the planning commission such extensions or additions shall be designed as temporary turnarounds having paved area with a diameter equal to the width of the required street rightofway 17 private streets and travel easements a permanent travel easement may be permitted under certain conditions pursuant to tennessee  these easements shall meet the following minimum standards requirements and any special conditions attached by the planning commission and the requirements and special conditions for the easement shall be placed on the final plat for recording a a permanent easement shall be of a required width of no less than fifty 50 feet however the planning commission may require greater widths if necessary to meet special conditions presented by the site or reflected on the final plat 1 in instances where a travel easement is connected to a street that is nonconforming because its existence precedes the towns adoption of subdivision regulations then that easement shall only be required to have the width of the rightofway of the street to which it connects 2 in instances where the planning commission finds that a property is constrained topographically in such a manner that any further subdivision would be an impossibility a travel easement of 20 feet in width for a residential property or 30 feet in width for a commercial property may be allowed any further subdivision of a property after it is granted a 20 or 30 feet in width travel easement shall constitute a forfeiture of the 20 or 30 feet in width travel savannah subdivision regulations iii  9 easement the property would then be required to meet all of the requirements for an improved street set forth in of these regulations including the requirement of at least 50 feet in width of rightofway dedication b a permanent easement providing legal access to more than one lot shall be improved to meet the road and construction standards as specified herein for public street improvements modification of said standards may be directed by the planning commission to meet site specific conditions c permanent easement improvements shall be maintained by the developerowner or by a legally established home owners association or other similar group approved by the planning commission the legal documents establishing the easement and the home owners association shall be submitted with the final plat for review and approval and shall be recorded with the final plat d if at any future date a permanent easement is submitted for acceptance as a public street or road it shall be submitted to the planning commission for approval and recommendation to the city board of commissioners in considering the easement for approval as a public street or road the planning commission shall require the improvements to the easement to meet the minimum street construction standards in effect at the time the request for public acceptance is made e a building permit may be issued for a building to be located on a recorded lot of record prior to the effective date of these regulations which lot fronts on a permanent easement with access to an existing public street or road  provided however that any future subdivision of said lot or parcel shall be subject to these provisions 18 street names proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other already existing named streets shall bear the names of existing streets in no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate an existing street name irrespective of the suffix used ie street avenue boulevard drive parkway cove court or place the names of all proposedstreets shall be approved by the e911 board 19 alleys savannah subdivision regulations iii  10 alleys may be provided to serve the rear of lots or building sites used for commercial or industrial purposes alleys shall not be provided in any solely residential block resubdivision of land for residential use in areas where alleys are existing shall provide for the vacation of such alleys d street lighting within the savannah planning region street lighting may be provided at the discretion of the subdivider however if provided

homeowners association established by the subdivider any cost differential as a result of a deviation from the standard street lighting provisions of the utility provider having jurisdiction including underground service or special fixtures shall be paid by the subdivider e lot layout in general all lots within a subdivision shall have about the same area  however a subdivision plan should not be predicated solely upon producing a maximum density the lot layout plan should give balanced consideration to the natural topography of the tract being subdivided to the conservation and preservation of the natural environment to the provision of adequate open space to the enhancement of the character and beauty of the community to the optimization of lot density to improvements ratio and to the protection of life and property 1 adequate building sites each lot shall contain a building site not subject to flooding or other hazards as defined in of this article  and such site shall be outside

setback line from the center of the transmission line as follows voltage line minimum building setback 46 kv 37 12 feet 69 kv 50 feet 161 kv 75 feet 5 large tracts or parcels where land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building sites such parcels shall be arranged to allow for future opening of streets and for logical resubdivision in no case shall this be construed to allow the creation of severed parcels 6 lot drainage and grading where possible lots shall drain toward the street or toward both the street and the rear lot lines in case of drainage to the rear lot line lateral drainage along rear lot lines shall be required necessitating careful attention to grading where necessitated by the topography side yard drainage may be required in which case it may be necessary to increase minimum side yard requirements terracing of lots particularly in a residential subdivision shall be avoided unless essential for erosion control or to reduce the velocity of runoff savannah subdivision regulations iii  12 f open space and easements no single aspect of subdivision design contributes more to the attractiveness and value of a subdivision development than the effective use of open space the provision of open space and easements preferably designed for multiple uses is an essential consideration in the planning and design of both residential and nonresidential subdivisions 1 open space for control of storm water runoff where necessary design of permanent and temporary storm water detention or retention ponds shall be an integral part of subdivision design such design shall consider opportunities to create open space landscaped areas for storm water management ponds while at the same time considering dual uses such as public

subdivision regulations iii  13 streets there shall be a continuous screening of acceptable design along the rear of such lots 5 conservation and preservation of community assets for all types of land uses due consideration shall be given to providing open space needed to conserve notable features of the natural environment such as large trees watercourses and prominent scenic terrain adequate provision shall be made to protect and preserve historical sites or similar community assets which add to the attractiveness and value of property 6 private use open space open space may be reserved

use it shall not be encroached upon by any building structure or parking area and shall be so noted on the final plat of the subdivision g suitability of land the planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of any land where it has been found that in the public interest the land is not suitable for subdivision development of the type proposed any land use which may result in increased upstream or downstream flooding endanger health life or property or aggravate downstream erosion sedimentation or pollution shall not be approved for subdivision any land within a proposed subdivision which is unsuitable for the intended use shall be reserved for open space or other compatible uses which will not be endangered by any inherent hazard of the site 1 residential land use savannah subdivision regulations iii  14 land which is subject to flooding or which has unsuitable soil or ground water conditions shall not be subdivided for any type of residential use 2 building site suitability no lot or tract intended for use as a building site shall be permitted where a natural or manmade condition on or adjacent to such lot or tract may endanger the integrity of any building
