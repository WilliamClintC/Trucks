where applicable general references public contracts  see ch 35 officers and employees  see ch 72  841 title this chapter shall be known as an the use of government buildings and equipment for political fundraising  842 findings and purpose whereas our laws in new jersey do not presently ban solicitation or acceptance of political contributions by public office holders and employees while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties whereas solicitation and acceptance of political contributions in rooms and buildings occupied in the discharge of official municipal business undermines the efficiency of government by taking officials and employees away from the peoples business and leads to the appearance of improper influence of political contributions

leave open ample alternative venues for political fundraising whereas our laws in new jersey do not presently recognize the misuse of public property for political fundraising as a distinct offense therefore it is accordingly found and determined that the municipalitys interests in an independent and efficient government workforce and a government that is undermined by neither the fact nor appearance of improper influence of political contributions on government decisions  borough of oceanport nj ecode360  84392 a b require the prohibition of political fundraising in rooms or buildings
