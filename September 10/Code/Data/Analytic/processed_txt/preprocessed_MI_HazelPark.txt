numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of

city finds that synthetic marijuana consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana with that use having become increasingly popular particularly among teens and young adults b the city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers hospitals emergency room doctors and police agencies that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions tremors seizures hallucinations unconsciousness anxiety attacks dangerously elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them c the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process d the city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances that while not approved for human consumption are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which upon consumption may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana c based on these findings this chapter is adopted for the purpose and with the intent to protect the public health and safety of the city and its residents from the threat posed by the availability and use of synthetic marijuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in possessing and using them

the city to carry out the will of the united states congress by authorizing telecommunication facilities needed to operate wireless telecommunication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless telecommunication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this section to a facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless telecommunication facilities and ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings b establish predetermined zoning districts of the number shape and in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless telecommunication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions c recognize that operation of a wireless telecommunication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined zoning districts in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the city consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities d limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs e minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities including possible removal of unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner f minimize the negative visual impact of wireless telecommunication facilities on neighborhoods community landmarks historic sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsofway this contemplates the

finds that the presence of numerous tower structures would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the city this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an
