reliable water quality class b or better in goose pond is critical to the continued recreational use of the pond and to the wildlife which lives in and around the pond the residential use of goose pond was established and developed prior to townwide zoning upon adoption of the first townwide zoning the goose pond area was classified with the forestry district the goose pond area is sufficiently distinct from the forestry district with respect to use building size and configuration lot size residential density and proximity to the waterfront of goose pond that a new zoning district is appropriate the geographical boundaries of the goose pond district reflect these distinctions 1 the goose pond district is fully subdivided and increases in either the density of residences or additional uses are prohibited district regulations have been established to ensure these restrictions will be enforced 2 uses permitted in the area are consistent with the dominant seasonal residential use and strong orientation to goose pond recognizing that residents are concerned with the quiet enjoyment of their property and the pond commercial uses and other uses that are acceptable in the surrounding forestry district are not compatible with this concept of paramount importance is maintaining the water quality in goose pond so that it is safe for swimming and other water based recreational activities and can support a healthy aquatic ecosystem therefore the use of nh des approved advanced septic technology in lieu of traditional leach fields is encouraged b uses permitted

street layout and design 1401 street design and function in general the character of a street will complement the character of the land it serves and will be consistent with its function in the town street system in every case the town recognizes that streets are meant to carry goods and people whether by vehicle by bicycle or on foot street rightsofway will be considered multipurpose in order to accommodate these modes of transportation stormwater treatment must be considered in the design and construction of streets the design features are as follows a downtown main streets are characterized by onstreet parking sidewalks pedestrian cross walks signalized intersections street furniture street trees the slowest speeds motorized vehicles sharing the road with bicycles commercial activity and public spaces they may be classified as local collector or arterial depending on traffic volume b downtown residential neighborhood streets are characterized by occasional onstreet parking traffic calming sidewalks signed intersections street trees and slow speeds motorized vehicles share the road with bicycles and pedestrians these streets abut private yards and may serve as local or connector roads depending on traffic volume c statenumbered arterials connect villages and more densely settled places they are characterized by signalized intersections street trees and sidewalks close to downtown bike lanes and faster speeds d rural arterials connect hamlets and less densely settled places they are characterized by signed intersections slow to moderate speeds and paving motorized vehicles share the road with bicyclists and pedestrians e rural roads may be local or collector roads and are characterized by variety of terrain lanes shared with bicycles and pedestrians slow speeds signed intersections and a mix of paved and unpaved roads f class vi roads are not maintained by the town they provide access to wild land and wood lots and are characterized by unmanaged roadside vegetation yearround recreational use and minimal or no vehicular use 1402 conformance with official map the layout of all streets shall conform to the official map if such exists 1403 connection with existing and possible future subdivisions where terrain permits and connectivity would be enhanced new roads and recreation corridors or easements reserved for future roads or recreation corridors may be required by the planning board to extend to the boundaries of the subdivision to provide for future connectivity to adjacent parcels such roads corridors or easements should be shown on the final plat new road extensions and recreational corridors should be aligned so as to provide access to existing and possible future roads or recreational corridors in adjacent subdivisions 1404 adjustment of street alignment or rightofway where a subdivision abuts an existing street and the alignment or rightofway width of such street is rendered inadequate because of the needs created by the proposed subdivision the applicant shall include in the street dedication all land needed to meet the standards established by these regulations and as approved by the board and such street dedication shall be shown on the final plat the applicant may be required to correct the inadequacy subdivision regulations town of hanover new hampshire  44 1405 street pattern the layout of the street pattern shall be based on a local street system connected to a collector street system connected to an arterial street system in conformance with the standards set forth in 15 whenever possible local streets should form a wellconnected network that provides for safe direct and convenient access by vehicles and pedestrians 1406 harmony with topography street patterns shall give due consideration to contours and natural features subdivision streets shall be laid out to blend with the existing topography applicants shall consider the following guidelines in laying out new streets a an alignment should be chosen that blends with the terrain and adjusts to important natural and scenic features b in most instances the appropriate alignment will be characterized by curves that continually adjust to the rolling topography of natural landforms a curvilinear alignment is visually and functionally preferable to straight segments that cut leaving steep unsightly and unstable embankments blending with the landscape reduces cut and fill quantities may offer more efficient use of natural drainage channels and better controls roadside erosion because natural vegetation is preserved c where the land is level or a strong linear direction is created by landscape elements such as a long row of trees or patterns of fields or stone walls the use of a straight segment may be justified when a straight segment is used it should be directed toward a natural or manmade focal point d a road that climbs a hillside should wind to the crest traversing the contours rather than climbing straight up e a roadway that crosses a ridge should be located in a saddle or low area along the ridge top f natural and manmade features provide variety and contrast that maintain the travelers interest whenever possible alignments should be located to bring more interesting features into view g near the edges of surface water woods or a break in topography alignments should echo or emphasize the shape of the edges h a roadway that approaches important features should first allow a distant view of the object then curve away and finally bring the feature close for a contrasting view i consistency in the scale of horizontal and vertical elements should be maintained whenever possible small dips and humps should be avoided in what is actually a uniform grade and short sharp curves should be avoided in what is actually a long curve j transitions between the beginning and ending of horizontal and vertical curves should be gradual 1407 intersection alignment and grades streets intersecting at 90 degrees create the safest street intersections any variance from a 90 degree intersection will be considered favorably only when there are safe sight distances but in general the intersection of two streets at less than a 75degree angle may only be approved if found by the planning board and director of public works to be safe and convenient the grade within 75 feet of a travelway of the intersection shall be no more than 5% subdivision regulations town of hanover new hampshire  45 no object shall impair corner visibility where necessary in the judgment of the board signals or other intersection improvements may be required at the intersection of the existing street providing access to the subdivision with the new street or at an existing intersection when such need has been created by the subdivision the board may require the applicant to pay for some or all of the signals or intersection improvements outside the subdivision 1408 multiple intersections intersections involving a junction of more than four street segments shall be prohibited unless configured as a roundabout except at roundabouts the minimum distance between centerlines of successive intersections shall be 150 feet 1409 connectivity and closedend streets the preferred design for street layout is one that enhances connectivity of new streets with existing streets however terrain limitations and other land use constraints sometimes prevent connections in these cases a closed end street may be appropriate and may offer several advantages when a closed end street is proposed the length and layout should be designed to facilitate compact development close to existing streets to protect open space and wildlife habitat in unfragmented tracts of land and to prevent disruption of headwater areas and waterbodies in order to protect water quality a closedend streets especially long ones are generally discouraged because 1 an accident a stalled vehicle a fallen tree a washout a snow pile or construction can block the access segment and the ability to reach lots farther along the closedend street 2 traffic from all of the lots served by the closedend street is concentrated at one end 3 the first equipment arriving at a fire or other emergency may block other traffic or equipment arriving later or interfere with the maneuvering of the equipment 4 closedend streets tend to isolate neighborhoods from other neighborhoods b where reasonably possible closedend streets should be connected to other nearby closedend streets or other nearby parts of the street system with bicycle and pedestrian corridors on public easements or rightsofway such connections to adjacent subdivision streets and recreational corridors shall be reserved c the length of the access segment of a closedend street shall be at least equal to the minimum lot frontage required by the zoning or 150 feet whichever is more configured in such a way that the frontage requirement of at least one lot is met prior to the turnaround portion of the closedend street d the maximum centerline length of the access segment of a closedend street shall not exceed 500 feet unless public benefits such as reduced natural resource impact enhanced open space preservation of valuable natural or manmade features enhancement or preservation of features of visual or scenic quality or affordable housing are provided and documented to the satisfaction of the planning board e no lot in a lotbased subdivision lot or building in a planned residential development prd or continuing care retirement community ccrc on a closedend street shall be located more than 500 feet from a public street  however this distance may be subdivision regulations town of hanover new hampshire  46 increased up to a maximum of 1000 feet if all of the following standards are met 1 the extension is approved in writing by the fire chief director of public works and director of the hanover water works company if applicable  2 if the lots are to be served by municipal water and the system is not otherwise looped there is an easement from the turnaround to another street to provide a looped water system  3 there are hydrants along the closedend road and at the turnaround or the houses are sprinklered  4 neighborhood connectivity is accomplished via bike paths or pedestrian ways or emergencyonly links  and 5 public benefits such as reduced natural resource impact enhanced open space preservation of valuable natural or manmade features enhancement or preservation of features of visual or scenic quality or affordable housing are provided and documented to the satisfaction of the planning board f a permanent closedend street shall terminate in a suitable turnaround the turnaround shall be designed and maintained to provide for adequate drainage and maneuverability of emergency and road maintenance vehicles 1410 temporary closedend streets in the case of temporary closedend streets where future extension to another outlet is approved by the board the full width of the rightofway to the subdivision property line shall be reserved as a street rightofway and shall be shown on the final plat for a closedend street of a temporary nature a turnaround shall be provided and provision shall be made for future extension of the street adjacent property and for reversion of any excess rightofway to the adjoining properties in a phased development a street shall not be considered closedend if shown on the approved subdivision plan as ultimately having more than one open end intersecting with the street network of the town 1411 curb cuts curb cuts of local and collector streets onto arterial streets shall be minimized 1412 traffic calming local residential streets shall be designed to encourage connectivity but discourage in order to encourage low speeds and promote safety streets should be designed to gently follow landforms slow vehicle speeds are safer for motorists and pedestrians both onsite and offsite traffic calming may be required as a result of projected traffic impacts of proposed new development and the applicant may be required to provide offsite traffic calming measures or to pay some or all of the costs of such measures see hanovers traffic calming policy subdivision regulations town of hanover new hampshire  47 options for retrofit include roadway striping edge line markings roundabouts
