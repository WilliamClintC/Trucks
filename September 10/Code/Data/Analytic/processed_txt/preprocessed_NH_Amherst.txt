to conform to applicable provisions of the master plan  safely and conveniently accommodate transportation and access needs of the public  and provide reliable access for firefighting and other essential public and private services 3012 arrangement of streets the horizontal alignment of streets shall be platted so as to comprise a convenient transportation system  provide for the continuation of streets to adjoining neighborhoods and collector streets  provide for future rightofway extensions to undeveloped properties if deemed appropriate by the planning board  and to facilitate efficient future extensions of public and private utilities streets shall be arranged to provide maximum separation of local traffic and to discourage in residential neighborhoods 3013 relationship of streets to topography streets within any platted subdivision shall be designed to form a logical relationship between the vertical and horizontal alignments of such streets and the topography of adjoining land specifically the horizontal and vertical alignment of platted streets shall avoid the need for cut and fill depths which in the opinion of the planning board are unreasonably severe  and shall afford a minimum of one location where safe and convenient driveway access can be achieved along the frontage of each platted lot without need for excessive excavation 3014 dedication of supplemental rightofway in the commercial and industrial zoning districts where land which is the subject of an application for approval under these regulations fronts upon an existing class v public street having a rightofway width less than that required based upon the classification of that street under these regulations the applicant shall dedicate supplemental

be intersected by said culdesac street to the radius point of the culdesac shall not generally exceed 1200feet  however the planning board may permit the construction of culdesac streets of greater length providing the applicant has submitted evidence that such an approval will not be contrary to the general health safety and welfare of residents and that adequate provision has been made for public safety all temporary culdesacs shall be planned designed and constructed to the same standards as permanent culdesacs unless the planning board determines that a subsequent extension of the

architectural feature that should enhance the character of the house street and historic district the commission encourages the replacement over time of fences that do not conform to these guidelines existing fences that resemble their historic styles shall only be replaced in kind new fences intended to replace missing fences shall reproduce the historic style wherever possible provided sufficient documentary evidence exists applicants intent ones intent for installing a new fence or changing the style or construction of an existing fence must be clearly stated when applying for a certificate of approval the desire for privacy andor to enclose children or pets is not an acceptable reason of itself acceptable reasons include a restoring a welldocumented historic fence the standards for which shall be the same as those for restoration of a missing architectural feature  b replacing an inappropriate contemporary style fence with a historically appropriate style  c changing a fence style to better complement the rhythm of existing fences of the streetscape  d installing a new fence where one 1 is absent and such absence breaks the welldefined rhythm of existing fences on the streetscape  e protecting the value of a residential property from the negative economic impact of an adjoining commercial property see privacy fence guidelines f installing a new fence where the style and location are in keeping with these guidelines cause for relief the basis upon which relief from these regulations may be granted is stated in h relief will not be granted based solely upon  a photographic evidence of other fences in the historic district that do not currently meet these guidelines  b the applicants personal reference for a nonconforming style of fence  c relative costs of construction or maintenance among various styles of fences  d dislike of ones neighbor or dissatisfaction with a neighbors habits a spite fence near ossipee built by thomas plant when he was turned down trying to buy his neighbors land he built this fence of castoff lumber directly across the street in their full view demolition fence applications shall not be approved without clear photographs sketched andor drawings that depict the exact location and accurately represent the proposed final product along with a description of materials and measurements of all members including spacing between members ie posts rails distance between pickets heights etc acceptable styles the fence should be in harmony with the style of the house and rhythm of the streetscape eg simple fence with a vernacular house simple or highstyle house picket fence along a paced sidewalk etc acceptable fences generally include a post & rail with wooden posts and wither timber or board rails the number of rails should be two 2 if timber and three 3 or four 4 if board board rail fences should have a face board on the posts and a board cap along the top timber rails board rails with

boardonboard are not acceptable stone walls generally are not appropriate along village streets and between closely position residences in the village dry laid stone walls are acceptable as traditional boundaries between pastures and along country roads eg mack hill road jones road streetscape a variety of styles of connecting or abutting fences between separate properties along a common street is discouraged eg mixing picket with post & rail variety of construction and pattern within a given style is encouraged see  privacy fences a privacy fences are allowed only on an exception basis under extremely limited circumstances and for good cause shown eg as a visual barrier between residential and commercial properties to protect the historic integrity of the residential property b privacy fences generally will not be allowed to separate residential properties if the fence would be visible to the public view privacy per se shall not be considered sufficient cause for relief c landscaping is required with privacy fencing the first course is to consider natural vegetation as an alternative buffer to a privacy fence where a privacy fence is approved the applicant may be required to plant in front of it to soften the fence to the public view d since privacy fences are functional not ornamental only one 1 type is permitted solid board straight top with molded cap post caps allowed maximum six 6 feet tall e decorative picket lattice or other ornamental treatments along the top of the fence are prohibited applied or carved finials are prohibited f privacy fencing

pickets rails and posts shall be appropriate to the style of fence chosen for example materials that are too diminutive and spacing between picketsrailings that are too open give the historically uncharacteristic impression of lesser quality or poor craftsmanship and are discouraged in our colonial period public officials known as fence viewers were appointed to ensure that fences were built sheep high bull strong and hog tight diminutive posts excessive picket spacing materials fences shall be built of all natural materials eg no vinyl sawn or partially sawn granite posts are not allowed when restoring a granite post fence use posts that are split in the same manner as the missing historic posts historic split granite modern sawnsplit granite construction fences prebuilt in sections or kit form often create a packaged look and will not necessarily conform to these guidelines rails shall not be doweled to the posts unless the dowel is sufficiently hidden by pickets or balusters rails should be buttjointed and toenailed to the posts or mounted on brackets in the case of granite posts while the commission limits the number of fence styles it strongly encourages variety in fence construction and pattern within those styles too many fences of the same manufacturer or construction will give the district an historically uncharacteristic uniform or packaged look buttjoint acceptable dowel joint not acceptable paint post & rail picket and baluster fences shall be painted split rail horse fences shall be left natural or treated with a clear stain privacy fences may be left natural at the option of the commission if it is determined that the weathered wood will be less pronounced gates gates shall generally be of the same style as the fence to which they are
