stormwater management districts consistent with the bushkill creek and frys run study area release rate maps presented in the plans the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a76 for general reference b description of stormwater management districts four types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditional no detention i districts conditional no detention ii districts provisional no detention areas and dual release rate districts as described below 1 conditional no detention i districts frys run study area within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this ordinance the larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities the township reserves the right to require onehundredpercent release rate controls irrespective of the adequacy of the downstream capacity where the uncontrolled release could adversely impact downstream properties if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a onehundred 75editors note see 35 ps  6911 et seq 76editors note appendix a is on file in the township offices  15814 smoking  15815  percent release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  15816q any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  15816d by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist 2 conditional no detention ii districts frys run study area within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities must be calculated in the same manner as the conditional no detention i districts in this case however adequate capacity must be demonstrated from the site to the delaware river or lehigh river as applicable after determining if adequate capacity exists the developer shall use either no detention a onehundredpercent release rate or provide capacity improvements as onehundredpercent releaserate controls irrespective of the adequacy of the downstream capacity where the uncontrolled release could adversely impact downstream properties 3 provisional no detention districts bushkill creek these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities without adversely affecting the watershed peak flow in certain instances however the local runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff from the site to the main channel may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a proposed development in these instances the developer shall either use a onehundredpercent release control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  15816q the township reserves the right to require onehundredpercent releaserate controls irrespective of the adequacy of the downstream capacity where the uncontrolled release could adversely impact downstream properties in determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this ordinance similarly any capacity improvement must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  15816d 4 dual release rate districts bushkill creek and frys run study area within this district the twoyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the tenyear twentyfiveyear and onehundred year postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates  15815 palmer code  15815   15816 stormwater management district implementation provisions associated with the ten hundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed a applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this ordinance b any stormwater management controls required by this ordinance and subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  15817 c the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines d any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this ordinance shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion 2 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff e for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be  15815 smoking  15816  designed for up to a onehundredpercent release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate f for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a onehundredpercent release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate g for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention subarea a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control may not be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention subarea except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure h no portion of a site may be regraded to redirect runoff onto adjacent property except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedureor unless runoff peak flow rate and volume controls are proposed which limit postdevelopment peak flow rate and volume discharges to predevelopment levels i within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions  or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using  15816d and the minimum orifice criteria j offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity criteria in  15816d and the detention criteria in  15817 k for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate  15816 palmer code  15816  l where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes m development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this ordinance n in any stormwater management district the township reserves the right to require a more stringent design release rate andor volume control for a development site or other amendments to a drainage plan to address problems in the local runoff conveyance system downstream of the site such problems include existing flooding problems inadequate conveyance capacity poorly defined or poorly stabilized downstream conveyance systems or other factors o no harm water quantity option for any proposed development site not located in a conditional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the delaware river or lehigh river as applicable proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  15816d if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification 1 attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions a the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two ten twentyfive and onehundred year shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff models for the bushkill creek or the frys run study area or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the lehigh valley planning commission upon request b any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped  15816 smoking  15816  acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity c developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  15816q 2 any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per developers submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in  15814 p regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the stormwater management plan q capacity improvements in certain instances primarily within the conditional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in  15816d all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream r compatibility with npdes requirements any proposed regulated activity for which a permanent stormwater quality control detention  15816 palmer

the procedure for filing and approval of subdivision and land development plans sketch preliminary and final 2 these plans enable the planning commission and the board of supervisors to have an adequate opportunity to review the submission and to ensure that their formal recommendations are reflected in the final plan which is recorded in accordance with this 3 the table below outlines the stages for the different types of proposed subdivision or land development108 see definitions of each term in b sketch plan 1 while sketch plans are not required for major and minor subdivisions or land developments it is strongly recommended that they be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and informally with the planning commission before preparing a preliminary plan an early review will help a developer avoid the need to make major changes to the plan after the engineering is completed and thereby avoid unnecessary expenses and delays 2 comments made and not made by township officials on the sketch plan are only recommendations and are not binding upon the township or the applicant c preliminary plan except where a preliminary plan is not required the initial plan filed to the commission for formal review of a major subdivision or land development shall be considered the official 107 editors note the flowcharts regarding generalized processes for major and minor

are within close proximity to existing and proposed residences  the visual impact and glare from offpremises signs could create decreased residential property values in surrounding areas c the visual pollution and visual clutter that would result from uncontrolled placement of offpremises signs could harm areas of great natural and scenic beauty in the township this would threaten the objectives
