assistant clerk of council and to all other officers and employees of the city of mansfield who gave their time and counsel to the 1997 codification of the citys ordinances and the preparation of current replacement pages contents preliminary unit general index comparative codified ordinances of mansfield ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a

violation if the violation notice is given by phone a written notification must be received within ten working days the sampling must be completed within 30 calendar days of first becoming aware of the pollutant in violation if the analysis shows a violation then the discharger will be notified that a compliance schedule is required all additional monitoring beyond the minimum requirements must be reported if the sampling indicates no additional violations then no further action will be required by the discharger at the time any substantial change in discharge of an industrial users discharge must be reported by a responsible corporate officer or his designated representative in advance including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 cfr p 1 the city shall deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the nature of pollutants to the potw by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards or such contributions would cause the potw to violate its npdes permit where categorical standards allow a threeday average limit and the report of scheduled sampling shows the discharge exceeds the threeday average but within the maximum daily limit the city will perform a second sampling for the parameter of concern if the second sampling again indicates the discharge is in excess of the threeday average the discharger will be notified and will be required to report seven days of sampling for that parameter to show the pollutant does not exceed allowable limits breports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge including the date the samples were taken exact location method

shall be as prescribed in the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or at intervals determined to be necessary by the city issued in the discharge permit if the pollutant concentration in the discharge is of such varying nature or if there is a reasonable risk of a slug of a pollutant that a grab sample of the wastewater cannot be relied upon to furnish a representative analysis of the industrys discharge then the city may require the installation of special sampling devices on a casebycase basis as determined by the city this may include a continuous
