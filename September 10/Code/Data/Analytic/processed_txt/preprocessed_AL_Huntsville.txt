relief as measured from the lowest elevation contour that bounds the 15 percent or greater slope to the highest contour of the district as defined herein in addition the upper boundary shall be extended 50 feet horizontal distance beyond the elevation contour immediately below which a 25foot vertical span exhibits a slope of 15 percent or greater  when a lot is divided by the slope development district boundary line the lot shall be considered as lying wholly within the district unless it satisfies the following conditions 1 that portion of the lot lying within the slope development district shall remain undisturbed and shall have a restriction placed on the final plat requiring that it be retained in its natural state except for hiking trails and 2 that portion of

the open spaces required for each a where portions of buildings contain different numbers of stories required clearance from lot or building site lines shall be as established for the portion nearest to the lot line except where spacing required for portions farther from the line is of greater depth in which case the depth so established is the required clearance from the lot or site line as

improved in relation to views from the same or higher levels by visual amenities such as landscaping but such lower portions shall provide clearance to meet their own requirements the drawing which follows illustrates these relationships at the left of the building the lot or building site line would be required to be at or beyond the point at which the diagonal at a reaches the ground since the portion of the building to which it relates requires greater spacing than does b to the right of the building d requires greater spacing than does c and would therefore determine the requirement

shortest distance between the walls end corners length of the wall of a circular building shall be construed as the diameter of the building the drawing which follows illustrates the setbacks required when there is an offset in a wall equalling 30 percent or more of the height of the facade building spacing required c height in stories shall be computed as actual number of stories in the wall above ground level with the following exceptions where the wall is along a slope number of stories shall be construed as the arithmetic mean number with half a story or more considered as a full story and less than half a story ignored in computations when height per story exceeds an average of 11 feet calculations involved in yard or spacing determinations shall be based on an assumed number of stories derived by dividing building height by ten feet penthouses roof shelters and housing for mechanical equipment shall be ignored in computations involving number of stories except where they are visible from the ground level within 200 feet of the lot are ten feet or more in height and occupy 50 percent or more of the length of the wall at their bases in which case an additional story shall
