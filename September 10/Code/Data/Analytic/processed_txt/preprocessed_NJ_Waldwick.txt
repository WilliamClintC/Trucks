on file as a public record in the offices of the borough clerk and building inspector and department of building inspection  397 when effective this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption and publication as provided by law reserved reserved reserved reserved eminent domain  441 findings of the mayor and council whereas on  the supreme court of the united states decided the case of kelo v city of new london in which a majority of the  394 waldwick borough code  441  court determined among other things that the public purpose provision of the united states constitution should be broadly interpreted to effectuate legislative judgments as to what particular needs justify the use of the power of eminent domain  and whereas the result in kelo was a plurality decision reflecting the courts deep division on the question presented namely whether private residential real property may be the subject of eminent domain in order to satisfy a public purpose such as a planned development  and whereas the result of the kelo decision was that where there existed a comprehensive plan of development that is deemed to satisfy the public purpose provision of the constitution even though the motivation for the plan might be economic development municipalities could use the eminent domain power to achieve the desired end as long as all parties legal rights were established in the process  and whereas the kelo majority opinion specifically emphasized that nothing in the decision should preclude a state from placing further restrictions on the takings power  and whereas one of the issues faced by the court was the appropriate line between public and private use  and whereas under the settled law of the state of new jersey the limitless sovereign power of the state may be employed to take real property as may be required for public safety necessity convenience or welfare so long as just compensation is paid the owner but it is for the legislative branch of government to determine what constitutes a public use as to limit that broad power with the result that the power is to be used in a reasonable nonarbitrary manner and not greater than necessary to effectuate the public use  and whereas the borough of waldwick believes that one of the primary purposes of government is to protect the rights of owneroccupied residential real properties within the borough against governmental takings that do not have as their goal either a the transfer of private property to public ownership for the creation of for example a road hospital or military base or b the transfer of private property to private owners for the specific purpose of making the same available for public use eg railroad public utility or stadium  442 eminent domain be it ordained by the mayor and council of the borough of waldwick county of bergen and the state of new jersey that the borough shall not employ the power of eminent domain so as to deprive owneroccupiers of residential real properties of such ownership rights in the absence of a specified purpose a to transfer the property to public ownership for the creation of a public use including but not limited to a road hospital military base sewer water line sidewalk rightofway flood control park  441 general provisions  442  open space erosion control mechanism and the like or b to

reduce the overall amount of excess nutrients entering waterways thereby helping to protect and improve surface water quality this ordinance does not apply to fertilizer application on commercial farms  677 basis and background elevated levels of nutrients particularly phosphorus in surface waterbodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants eutrophication excessive plant growth can result in diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and ph which in turn can be detrimental to aquatic life as algae and plant materials die off the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels the presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected water for recreation and water supply while healthy vegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing soil and filtering precipitation when fertilizers are applied to the land surface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation nutrients can be transported by means stormwater to nearby waterways contributing to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation most soils in new jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorus to support adequate root growth for established turf over time it is necessary to replenish available phosphorus but generally not at the levels commonly applied other target vegetation such as vegetable gardens and agricultural horticultural plantings will have a greater need for phosphorus application as will the repair or establishment of new lawns or cover vegetation a soils test and fertilizer application recommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best means to determine the amount of nutrients to apply timing and placement of fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrients to waterways runoff fertilizer applied immediately prior to a runoffproducing rainfall outside the growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of supporting target vegetation growth therefore the management of the type amount and techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources this ordinance does not apply to application of fertilizer on commercial farms but improper application of fertilizer on farms would be problematic as well stewardship on the part of commercial farmers is needed to address this potential source of excess nutrient load to waterbodies commercial farmers are expected to implement best management practices
