commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage of  statement of purpose  objectives a it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands b the objectives of this chapter are flood damage prevention regulations 132 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of tbe general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to nunnmze damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood plains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone

hudson is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to north carolina law including but not limited to of the constitution of north carolina  town of hudson  north carolina general statutes 1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder  session law 2004163   185 103 findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydro logic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion non point and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance therefore the town of hudson establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge 104 purpose a general the purpose of this ordinance is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit 4  discharges into municipal stormwater systems it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2 requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encouraging the use of better management and site des1gn practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7 establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance 8 coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the town of hudson 5 9 controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system 105
