hanover township stormwater management   1682 statement of findings the governing body of the township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  1681 plumbing  1682   1683 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within west hanover township by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  1682 of this chapter intended to  1684 statutory authority g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth b manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems c preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable d maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes h provide procedures performance standards and design criteria for stormwater planning and management i provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and permanent stormwater

a freeway is a limited access roadway 2 highway a highway is usually a state or interstate highway which provides intermunicipal up to interstate traffic of substantial volumes a highway usually accommodates operating speeds up to 55 miles per hour mph 3 arterial an arterial is a highvolume street that should have no access other than by way of a collector street its function is to conduct traffic between communities and activity centers and to connect communities to highways and freeways the design speed is typically 45 mph or more see illustration  4 collector as the principal traffic artery within residential or commercial areas the collector carries relatively high traffic volumes and conveys traffic from arterial streets to lowerorder streets its function is to promote the free flow of traffic consequently the township does not encourage parking or residences along a collector the collectors secondary function is to serve abutting land uses a collector street may also accommodate public transit such as buses the design speed is typically 40 mph see illustration 1 5 subcollector the subcollector provides passage to access streets and conveys traffic to collectors like the access street the subcollector provides frontage and access to residential lots but also carries some to lowerorder access streets the subcollector is a relatively lowvolume street the design speed is typically 30 mph see illustration 1 6 access street the access street is designed to conduct traffic between dwelling units and higherorder streets as the lowestorder street in the hierarchy the access street carries no includes short streets culsdesac and courts subcollectors usually serve more dwellings and carry a small 105 editors note illustration 1 is included at the end of this chapter  17325 west hanover code  17325  volume of to one or more access streets the design speed is typically 20 mph see illustration 1 7 alley service street alleys are specialpurpose service roads that provide secondary means of access to lots 8 nonresidential street these streets serve nonresidential areas such as retail office or industrial the design speed is typically 40 mph 9 roadway

wishes to subdivide farm for residential housing owner has completed a density calculation  19586b which determined the maximum number of permitted lots 162 since the proposed subdivision involves four or more lots  19584a1 an area of permanent open space is required  19586a3 when open space is required to achieve the potential for the same number of lots as determined by the density calculation in this case 162 lots a reduced lot size is permitted this is done by calculating the minimum lot size step 1 take total tract area subtract any area applicable under environmental protection overlay district epod and subtract the amount of land required for open space in accordance with the zoning district in which the property is located in this case the required open space for the r1 district is 35% of the total tract area the number of acres after subtracting becomes the remaining tract area  19586 west hanover code  19586   19587 permitted uses amended 4162001 by
