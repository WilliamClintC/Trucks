governing conduct by public officials  and public office not be used for private gain  and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government public officials and employees must serve their government in a fiduciary capacity and must not bestow special consideration upon any person merely because of that persons relationship to an official or employee the attainment of these ends is impaired whenever there exists conflict between the private interests of a public official or employee and his or her duties as such the public interest therefore requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts exist as well as in situations where conflicts might develop bit is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government accordingly legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it the right of each official and employee to privacy in his or her financial affairs must not therefore be limited beyond that disclosure necessary to ensure the integrity of government moreover because an essential principle underlying the staffing of our government is that its officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and retain private economic and other interests such opportunity should not be limited unless conflicts with the responsibility of such officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided cit is the policy

policy a1the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare by encouraging high quality housing throughout the community sufficient to meet the needs of all city residents 2throughout its history the city has offered a diverse housing stock that permitted families of varying income levels and with various housing needs to own homes in the community 3in recent years property values have escalated to the point of discouraging a diverse housing stock 4a certain percentage of residents who currently live in the city are unable to meet or maintain the household income level necessary to support home ownership and therefore must look to other communities for housing 5based upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing situation in the city it is apparent that the diversity of the citys housing stock has declined as a result of increasing property values and housing costs  that demolition of certain existing dwellings has led to a reduction in the diversity of the citys housing stock and affordable housing opportunities and that subsequent redevelopment has in many cases contributed to property value increases that further the difficulty of making affordable housing available in the city 6with the exception of housing developed in partnership with the city and the lake forest senior cottages foundation the privately developed new residential housing that is being built in the city generally is not affordable to low and moderateincome households 7the city recognizes the need to provide alternative housing opportunities in order to maintain the diversity of population that has historically characterized the city b1while this chapter provides specific alternatives to the production of onsite affordable

from building on land that exceeds 10% slope but is outside of the 20 foot setback from the 22 degree slope angle could be recommended if entire slope shows no indication of instability  and dvariation from any restriction could be recommended if the requested construction is less nonconforming than the existing residence and the ravine or bluff slope does not show any indication of instability  or if the applicant submits evidence based on current geotechnical engineering practices such as the simplified bishop method of stability analysis whereby variables of soil shear

character materials and color the structure must be architecturally and visually color size bulk compatible with surrounding existing buildings structures and uses or those likely to exist under the terms of the underlying zoning such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the facility the use of colors and facility designs should
