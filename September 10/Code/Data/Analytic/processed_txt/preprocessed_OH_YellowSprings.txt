buterbaughy editors note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is self identifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior

springs comes from an unconfined aquifer characterized by layers of loose sediment no surface barrier and is recharged primarily by rain that percolates down ground and to a lesser degree by the little miami river  and bwhereas the village of yellow springs drinking water supply is identified as a sole source aquifer and as such is protected by the sole source aquifer protection program authorized by of the safe drinking water act of 1974  and cwhereas the energy policy act 2005 allows the oil and gas industry exemption from rules and regulations of the safe drinking water act without showing evidence this exemption from general law will not violate rights  and dwhereas the aquifer that feeds the village of yellow springs is considered to be at high risk for contamination according to a 2003 epa susceptibility report  and ewhereas many communities across the nation have already experienced contamination of their streams lakes rivers and other sources of drinking water as a result of fracking and placement of injection wells  and fwhereas oil and gas companies have identified yellow springs and surrounding environs as geologically appropriate for injection wells due to the presence of mt simon sandstone  and gwhereas ohio and other states have experienced earthquakes in relation to the placement of injection wells  and hwhereas this chapter establishes a community bill of rights which recognizes and secures the civil and political rights of yellow springs residents pursuant to of the ohio constitution which states this enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people and all powers not herein delegated remain with the people  and iwhereas the ohio revised title vii titled jurisdiction of municipal corporations to prevent water pollution states that no person shall pollute a running stream the water of which is used for domestic purposes by a municipal corporation by putting therein a putrid or offensive substance injurious to health  and jwhereas this chapter bans the extraction of gas and oil within the village or the placement of injection wells along with associated activities because that extraction violates the civil rights of yellow springs residents and because it threatens the health safety and welfare of residents and neighborhoods of yellow springs  and kwhereas this chapter removes legal powers and authority from gas and oil extraction corporations within the village in recognition that those legal powers are illegitimate and unjust in that they place the rights of a corporate minority over the rights and political authority of a majority of yellow springs village residents  and lwhereas this chapter shall be known and may be cited as yellow springs community protection from gas and oil extraction   and mwhereas this chapter is enacted pursuant to the inherent right of the residents of yellow springs village to govern their own community including without limitation the declaration of independences declaration that governments are instituted to secure the rights of people and the ohio constitutions recognition that all political power is inherent in the people nnow therefore be it hereby resolved by the yellow springs village council that there is hereby adopted the following ordinance which establishes a bill of rights for the residents and communities of the village bans commercial extraction of gas and oil or the placement of injection wells within yellow springs village because those actions cannot be achieved without violating the rights of residents and communities or endangering their health safety and welfare  removes certain legal powers from gas and oil extraction corporations operating within yellow springs village  nullifies illegitimate state laws permits and other authorizations which interfere with the rights secured by this ordinance  and imposes liabilities and fines for violations thereof passed 10112 87802 findings and intent athe village council of yellow springs finds that the commercial extraction of gas and oil and the placement of injection wells in yellow springs village violates the rights of residents and neighborhoods and poses a significant threat to their health safety and welfare moreover widespread environmental and human health impacts have resulted from commercial gas and oil extraction and injection wells in other areas regulating these activities of commercial gas and oil extraction or injection well placement is not a solution as it automatically means allowing commercial gas and oil extraction to occur within the village thus violating the rights of residents and neighborhoods and endangering their health safety and welfare by allowing the deposit of toxins into the air soil water environment and the bodies of residents within the village bmeaningful regulatory limitations and prohibitions concerning gas and oil extraction along with zoning and land use provisions are barred because they conflict with certain legal powers claimed by resource extraction corporations the village council recognizes that environmental and economic sustainability cannot be achieved if the rights of municipal majorities are routinely overridden by corporate minorities claiming certain legal powers the village council also recognizes that sustainability cannot be achieved within a system of preemption which enables those corporations to use state governments to override local selfgovernment and which restricts municipalities to only that lawmaking specifically authorized by state government cthe village council believes that the protection of residents neighborhoods and the natural environment constitutes the highest and best use of the police powers that this municipality possesses the village council also believes that local legislation that embodies the interests of the community is mandated by the doctrine of the consent of the governed and the right to local community selfgovernment thus the village council hereby adopts this chapter which establishes a bill of rights for the residents and communities of the village and which bans the extraction of gas and oil and any storage of frack waste within yellow springs village along with associated activities because that extraction and those activities cannot be achieved without violating the rights of residents and communities or endangering their health safety and welfare and which removes certain legal powers from gas and oil extraction corporations operating within yellow springs village while nullifying state laws permits and other authorizations which interfere with the rights secured by this chapter passed 10112 87803 definitions acorporation for purposes of this

engineer appendix b village of yellow springs recommended trees the following list of trees has been placed on file with the village for use by developers businesses and individuals seeking advice on the types of trees to use some consider streets more attractive when they contain only one kind of tree species however the pest risk is multiplied in that situation  therefore such plantings should be made with caution tree selection is extremely important in ensuring survivability and longterm health of trees the most important thing to remember when selecting trees is to match the tree to the site not the site to the tree where you have space for a large species always plant a large species it is the large tree species that will give the village of yellow springs the most benefits in the long run in addition they tend to be longer lived than smaller species when planted in the right location tree species diversity is important to a healthy resilient community tree population as well as age diversity a good rule to follow for the community urban forest as a whole is the 102030 rule the breakdown to shoot for is no more than 30% of a single family 20% of a single genus maple oak etc and no more than 10% of a single species this can be accomplished by street or by the community as a whole the trees suggested in this list were selected because their characteristics make them suitable for urban and home use the criteria used include deep roots minimal fruit or leaf litter regular and predictable form stress tolerance disease and insect resistance transplanting facility availability and ornamental value due to the culture and goals set forth by the yellow springs community native tree species should be given preference where a native species will thrive within the constraints of diversity goals all of the trees listed below are good for planting in both tree lawn areas and for landscape use in yards small trees with singlestem forms under 25 feet at maturity
