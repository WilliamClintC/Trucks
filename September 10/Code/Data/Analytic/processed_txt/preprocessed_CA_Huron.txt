1999   relationship between the need for the additional public facilities and the type of development for all of the essential infrastructure the city council is committed to maintaining the same level of public facilities and services and the same facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the most recent amendment of this chapter in order to ensure that to the extent that growth of the city occurs in the future there will be an adequate level of public facilities and services the city council finds that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for additional public facilities equipment and operations which the fee is designed to pay and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons a the city council has determined that new commercial and industrial developments result in a need for additional public services which in turn ultimately result in a need for additional government and public facilities for essential infrastructure and related facilities based on the level of public services and public facilitiestopopulation relationship for government and law enforcement services which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter the generation of traffic from consumers andor employees based on the type of commercial or industrial use the consumption of domestic water and production of wastewater based on average demand of similar or existing commercial or industrial uses and the amount of stormwater runoff generated by the installation or construction of impermeable surfaces the city council determines that commercial and industrial development should be assessed fees at rates to be established by resolution of the city council as the fair share of contribution of the costs of these required facilities and services b the city council has determined that residential development including new mobilehome park development results in significant increases in city population and that such residential development adversely affects the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter the city council has further determined that because residential development results in significant increases in population such development results in the need for essential infrastructure and related facilities including but not limited to general government facilities law enforcement facilities traffic systems including signalization domestic water production and distribution wastewater collection treatment and disposal and parks and recreation facilities based on the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on such date stormwater collection and disposal facilities based on the average amount of impermeable surface constructed for new residential development residential development shall be assessed a fee at the rate established by resolution of the city council for the costs for these required public facilities and services  part 1999   adjustment of fee the fee shall be adopted by resolution of the city council and shall be adjusted by resolution from time to time but not less than annually subject to city council review and approval after a noticed public hearing to reflect changes in costs as determined by the city manager in a written report the fee established by resolution of the city council shall be adjusted on an annual basis in an amount equal to change in the national average construction cost index as published by the engineering news record such adjustments are not deemed an increase in the amount of the fee and subject to the provisions of of the california government  part 1999   relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of facilities attributable to the development upon which the fee is imposed the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee set by resolution of the city council and the cost of the public facilities or portions thereof attributable to the new development on which the fee is imposed the basis for such determination is set out in reports to the city council from the city manager the city planner and the city engineer and such consultants as the city council determines are necessary if any to develop accurate costs and the fee to cover new public facilities and services  part 1999   relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development upon which the fee is imposed the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee for specified categories of public facilities and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons a the city council finds that the imposition of the fee on commercial and industrial development for parks and recreation facilities is not reasonable because the city council determines that there is no substantial demand placed on such facilities as a result of new commercial industrial and public facility development the city council finds further that the use of the fee generated from heavy industrial development for stormwater facilities is not reasonable because the city has required heavy industrial development to provide for its own onsite disposal of all stormwater generated on such property no substantial demand is placed on the citys stormwater facilities as a result of industrial development commercial light industrial and public facility development including schools may use the citys stormwater collection and disposal facilities and significantly impact the citys existing stormwater collection and disposal systems because commercial industrial public facility developments do increase demand on all other essential infrastructure and related facilities the city council finds that the use of the fee generated from commercial and industrial development for such facilities is reasonable b the city council finds that the use of the fee generated from new residential development for all essential infrastructure and related facilities including but not limited to water supply treatment facilities wastewater treatment and disposal law enforcement services parks and recreation facilities and stormwater collection and disposal and general facility fees is reasonable because growth in residential population places additional demands on all such facilities c the city council further finds that funding of the costs of essential infrastructure including capital equipment based on studies adopted by the city or associated with a capital improvement program accomplishes the goals and purposes set forth in subsections a and b of this section and that the use of revenues generated by the fee for projects and outlays set forth in studies adopted by the city or associated with a capital improvement program is warranted and justified  part 1999   payment of fee a any owner or developer applying for a building permit for commercial or industrial development shall be assessed and shall pay the fee in conjunction with payment for the building permit subject to the provisions of government  b any owner or developer of a residential development shall pay the fee on the date of final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued whichever occurs first in the case of parcel maps or subdivisions the fee shall be paid on a lump sum basis as follows 1 when the first dwelling in the development receives its final inspection or certificate of occupancy whichever occurs first that portion of the fee shall be paid which represents payment for each of the following general facilities  law enforcement facilities  public works facilities 2 as a condition of filing the final subdivision map that portion of the fee shall be paid which represents payment for each of the following recreation facilities  sewage treatment facilities  streets and thoroughfares  stormwater collection and disposal facilities  traffic control facilities  and water supply treatment facilities  part 1999   exempted activities any owner or developer engaging in development activities which satisfy the following criteria shall not be required to pay the fee a an alteration which does not increase the floor area of a structure  or b an addition to a singlefamily residential dwelling unit which does not constitute the addition of a dwelling unit as defined by the uniform building  part 1999   accounting for funds a pursuant to government the city council directs that each of the fees collected hereunder shall be maintained in a fund separate from the citys general fund and separate from each other in the following special accounts 1 general facilities necessary for the administration of the city  2 law enforcement facilities and equipment  3 recreational facilities  4 sewage treatment facilities  5 storm drainage facilities  6 traffic control facilities  7 water supply treatment and storage facilities b the city shall use the funds so deposited into these special accounts along with interest earnings thereon for the costs of public facilities as specified herein and only for the category of improvements for which the funds were deposited in that particular account c if the fee paid by an owner or developer for a particular development has been retained by the city for five or more years and city has not committed that fee to costs for public facilities then the city council shall make findings describing the continuing need to retain the fee each fiscal year thereafter if the city council does not make such findings then the city shall refund the collected fees as appropriate along with the interest if any which those funds have generated since they were collected  part 1999   annual findings a each year during the budget review process the city council shall review the status of compliance with this chapter

rehabilitate and enhance the environment of the state an environmental impact report is an informational document which when fully prepared in accordance with the ceqa and this chapter will inform public decisionmakers of the environmental effects of projects they propose to carry out or approve    evaluating environmental significance a it is necessary for the sponsor of a project to determine if the project will have a significant effect upon the environment only those projects which may have a significant effect on the environment require the preparation of an eir b the determination of whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment calls for careful judgment an ironclad definition of significant effect is not possible because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting examples of significant impact include the following consequences and potential consequences 1 disrupts alters or destroys an historic or archaeological site or its immediate surroundings  2 has a substantial impact on natural ecological recreational or scenic resources  3 displaces substantial numbers of people  4 is inconsistent with environmental plans and goals that have been adopted by the community  5 causes increased congestion traffic recreational other  6 has a substantial aesthetic or visual effect  7 breaches any national state or local standards relating

population  and 12 causes a seriously adverse public reaction based on environmental issues c if any of the following conditions are found to exist as a result of a project the project will be found to have a significant effect on the environment 1 impacts which have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment curtail the range of uses of the environment or reduce the diversity in the environment  2 impacts which achieve shortterm to the disadvantage of longterm environmental goals a shortterm impact on the environment is one which occurs in a relatively brief definitive period of time while longterm impacts are effects which will endure well into the future  and 3 impacts with substantial primary or secondary consequences primary consequences are immediately related to the project while secondary consequences are related more to primary consequences than to the project itself  4 impacts for a project which are individually limited but cumulatively considerable a project may impact on two 2 or more separate resources where the impact on each resource is relatively small if the effect of the total of those impacts on the environment is significant an eir must be prepared this provision does not apply to two or more separate projects where the impact of each is insignificant  5 the environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings either directly or indirectly d an eir must also be prepared whenever a proposed activity will impact on a resource of critical concern as identified by the california office of planning and research and specified in the environmental goals and policies of the state adopted by the governor due to the extreme likelihood of significant impact the eir must specify how the critical resources of the area will be protected e the following have been found not to have a significant impact upon the environment and are declared to be categorical exemptions 1 class 1 repair maintenance

adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided if the proposal is implemented describe any adverse impacts including those which can be reduced to an acceptable level but not eliminated where there are impacts that cannot be alleviated without imposing an alternative design see subsection d below their implications and the reasons why the project is being proposed notwithstanding their effect shall be described in detail do not neglect impacts on any aesthetically valuable surroundings or on human health c mitigation measures proposed to minimize the impact describe any mitigation measures written into the project plan to reduce significant environmentally adverse impacts to acceptable levels and the basis for considering these levels acceptable where a particular mitigation

alternatives shall be explained f any irreversible environmental changes which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented uses of renewable and nonrenewable resources during the initial and continued phases of the project are basically irreversible since a large commitment of resources makes removal or nonuse thereafter unlikely primary impacts and particularly secondary impacts such as a highway improvement which provides access to a nonaccessible area generally commit future generations to similar uses also irreversible damage can result from environmental accidents associated with the project any irretrievable commitments of resources shall be evaluated to assure that such current consumption is justified g the growthinducing impact of the proposed action discuss the ways in which the proposed project could foster population growth either directly or indirectly in the surrounding environment included in this are projects which would remove obstacles to population growth increases in the population may further tax existing resources so consideration must be given to this impact with or without anticipated population growth as a result of the project

as well it must not be assumed that growth in any area is necessarily beneficial detrimental or of little significance to the environment h the identity of all federal state or local agencies other organizations and private individuals consulted in preparing the eir and the identity of the persons firm or agency preparing the eir by contract or other authorization must be given with respect to

who reviewed a draft of the eir and must describe the disposition of issues raised eg revisions to the proposed project to mitigate anticipated impacts or objections in particular the major issues raised when the sponsors position is at variance with recommendations and objections must be addressed in detail eg reasons why specific comments and suggestions could not be accepted and factors of overriding importance prohibiting the incorporation of suggestions    public hearings a a public hearing on the environmental impact of a proposed project shall be held when the city council

taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard d within zone e of the flood insurance rate map a setback is required for all new development from the ocean lake bay riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip this buffer shall be designated according to the floodrelated erosion hazard and erosion rate in relation to the anticipated useful life of structures and depending upon the geologic hydrologic topographic and climatic characteristics of the land the buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes such as for agricultural forestry outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  part 2001 variance procedure   nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the huron city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2001   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the huron city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the fresno county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  part 2001   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the huron city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the huron city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense  create a nuisance see public safety or nuisance as defined in  cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the huron city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  part 2001 underground wiring code definitions whenever in this chapter the words or phrases hereinafter in this section defined are used they shall have the respective
