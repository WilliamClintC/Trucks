designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with

code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

even incidents of death to those participating in the manufacturing process and to innocent bystanders b use of 5x refined butane and higher is done to dissolve the tetrahydrocannabinol thc resin

higher is used c a honey oil lab using 5x refined butane and higher presents a serious hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by a combustible gas instrument such conditions present grave risk of loss where devices such as a taser are capable of igniting the gas resulting in an explosion d the resale of 5x refined butane and higher occurs at levels sufficient to aid the manufacture of honey oil such sales and possession of butane should be regulated to prevent the use of such butane in the manufacture of honey oil where such activity presents grave dangers

part   tree conservation and replacement a subdivisions and other development projects subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be designed to the extent possible to minimize destruction or damage to protected trees project design shall recognize the desirability of conserving trees plans for grading and infrastructure improvements shall reflect this consideration and shall include the following safeguards 1 location of minimum growing areas as required by individual species 2 minimal disruption or removal of structural or feeder roots 3 minimal filling cutting development or compaction of soils within the drip line 4 any other special measures as recommended by an arborist to ensure efforts to save a protected tree are adequate b it is recognized that the preservation of healthy trees will sometimes conflict with normal land development considerations such as proper drainage grading circulation safety lot configuration and utilities within most developments it will not be practical to preserve all healthy trees given the necessity of addressing other design and public safety requirements in such instances the developer is required to utilize creative landplanning techniques to retain the most desirable and significant healthy trees and notable stands of such trees the setaside of a natural area or areas within a project site which is particularly suitable for the planting retention andor natural regeneration of trees is considered to be a desirable means of accomplishing the goals of this chapter the area of any setaside shall be roughly equivalent to or exceed the area which would be occupied within the drip line if individual trees had been preserved setaside areas shall be in addition to any area classified as open space under the policies of the shasta lake general plan c if a protected tree must be removed from a property to facilitate development allowed by zoning replacement trees shall be provided to compensate for the loss replacement trees shall be provided in accordance with the standards provided in d if a property owner desires to remove a protected tree from a vacant or underdeveloped parcel without the submittal of a site development plan to the city for establishment of a primary use a use permit shall be required prior to the removal of the tree the use permit shall include conditions requiring a tree inventory of the site provisions for the removal of slash material and appropriate replanting and erosion control measures the type of use permit required pursuant to this section shall be as follows 1 an administrative use permit shall be required if the proposed activity will not result in the loss of more than three protected trees 2 a planning commission issued use permit shall be required if the proposed activity would result in the removal of more than three protected trees e the planning commission may consider tree preservation as adequate grounds to approve variances associated with building setbacks building separations parking requirements and driveway grades if the commission determines that 1 the preservation and retention of a protected tree outweighs the disadvantages associated with any variance granted to save it and 2 there is a real expectation that the tree will survive for more than five years  part   predevelopment review for major projects a predevelopment review 1 for any major project where it is proposed to remove more than five protected trees a predevelopment review shall be required the purpose of this review is to ensure that tree conservation is considered early in the planning process with respect to placement of buildings roads and driveways parking utilities and other site improvements 2 a tree delineation map shall be required for the predevelopment review meeting with the development services director or his or her designee this map shall show existing grades location and size of groups of similar trees stands and any trees which may be significant due to their size 3 conceptual development plans submitted at the predevelopment review phase shall show one or more methods of ensuring that tree conservation has been considered in project design in general development plans shall consider the following a stands of trees shall be preserved where feasible rather than individual trees as they provide better habitat and have a more likely chance of survival than individual trees surrounded by development where possible stands of trees shall be left in place so as to connect with other stands of trees on adjacent properties rather than separating natural treed areas with developed areas b for residential subdivisions the development shall consider potential neighborhood park areas and subdivision entrance areas in designating setaside areas for the purpose of preserving trees throughout the project boundaries c the development shall be designed such that suitable land will be set aside in an open space area which will 1 retain as many protected trees as are proposed to be removed  or 2 be particularly suitable for the planting andor natural regeneration of trees the setaside area shall be in addition to any area classified as open space under the policies of the shasta lake general plan d in evaluating tree preservation with respect to building placement the development shall consider the relative health and viability of trees healthy trees of varying ages shall be considered for preservation rather than removing several younger trees in order to save an older specimen tree which may be overmature e tree locations shall be reviewed in relation to planned roads driveways pavement structures overhead utility lines and underground utility trenches to ensure that trees will not be damaged by construction or development if the root system of any existing tree will be significantly damaged during construction or if the tree will conflict with any structure or improvement the site shall be redesigned or the tree shall be designated for removal at least forty 40 percent of the critical root zone shall remain undisturbed from construction for any tree proposed to remain on site f the base of a tree shall not be paved over or encased in planters or other enclosures which could change the grade at the base of the tree g grading or landscaping techniques that involve backfilling of soil around trees shall be avoided h the design of structures improvements and site grades shall conform to the natural topography of the site to the extent feasible to ensure survival of remaining trees i the proposed site drainage plan shall be reviewed for changes to surface water runoff that would affect trees final site drainage shall not allow surface water to pond around the base of trees j utility trenches shall avoid the critical root zone of any mature tree to be retained on site or minimize encroachment to the extent feasible the width or depth of utility trenches is not a consideration since the cutting of roots for any size trench may damage a tree severely to the extent feasible utilities shall be run along the edge of driveways or other paved areas to minimize impacts to trees k fire safety standards shall be considered in design of residential projects ie setback from proposed main and accessory structures fire breaks clearance from the canopy of other trees on the property b tree removal and replacement plan for major projects 1 for major projects on sites containing existing protected trees a tree removal and replacement plan shall be submitted

proposed changes to drainage patterns which could impact trees  l if deemed appropriate by the development services director or his or her designee a photographic record of trees affected by development may be required  part   findings required an application for a discretionary project shall also be considered an application for tree removal in those instances where trees will be affected by the development upon review of the application and consideration of the written and oral evidence received at the public hearing for a discretionary permit the planning commission shall render its decision the application shall be approved only if the applicant demonstrates and the commission affirmatively finds 1 the condition of the trees with respect to disease form general health damage public nuisance danger of falling proximity to existing structures interference with utility services good forestry practices or damage to existing sidewalks and driveways warrants their removal 2 the preservation of the trees unreasonably restricts the economic potential of the property upon which the trees are situated 3 the development has been designed such that suitable land will be set aside in an open space area which will a retain as many protected trees as are proposed to be removed  or b when the preservation of as many protected trees as are proposed to be removed unreasonably restricts the economic potential of the property upon which the trees are situated the setaside area is particularly suitable for the planting andor natural regeneration of replacement trees required to be planted by the developer the setaside area shall be in addition to any area classified as open space under the policies of the shasta lake general plan 4 trees proposed for removal interfere with utility services or streets and highways either within or outside of the subject property and no reasonable alternative to such interference exists other than removal of the trees 5 construction proposed within the drip line of any tree will not cause harm or damage to such tree and any construction on the property can be accomplished without endangering the health of the remaining trees on the subject property 6 tree removal as proposed will not result in soil erosion diversion or increased flow of surface waters that cannot be satisfactorily mitigated 7 tree removal will not result in the degradation of any scenic resource and will not substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site or its surroundings  part   treeplanting standards a the following treeplanting provisions shall apply to all new construction and to projects that result in the removal of a protected tree 1 new construction standards property zoned for minimum planting standard a residential subdivisions and multifamily three 15gallon trees shall be planted for each proposed singlefamily unitlot  and two 15gallon trees for each multifamily unit b commercial and public two 15gallon trees shall be planted for each 1000 square feet of gross floor area or covered space c industrial one 15gallon tree shall be planted for each 2000 square feet of gross floor area or covered space 2 if the provisions in the table above do not apply to a project involving tree removal such as clearing to expand a parking lot or to create a storage area then as an alternative a minimum of two fifteen 15 gallon trees shall be planted for every one protected tree removed 3 in addition to the treeplanting standards set forth above three fifteen 15 gallon trees shall be planted for each protected tree removed that exceeds ten inches dbh b the planning commission may allow for a different treeplanting requirement as a condition of a discretionary permit upon a finding that the alternate standard is consistent with the intent of this chapter this could include credit towards the above noted planting standards for significant trees such as mature valley oaks that are preserved c trees required pursuant to this section shall be planted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final permit in those instances where planting is in conjunction with construction under a valid building permit unless alternate timing for planting is recommended by an arborist d the species of any tree used for replacement pursuant to this section shall be suited to the citys climate zone and be chosen with consideration of any site specific limitations the use of native shade trees is preferred but not required a list of trees that are suitable to the area is included as appendix b the replacement tree shall be planted in a manner that is recognized as standard accepted practice unless a specific method is prescribed by an arborist e if the standards of this section conflict with any other treeplanting requirements applicable to the proposed development such as those set forth in landscaping of the city zoning code the most restrictive shall apply  part   construction standards the following standards shall be followed during construction activities to ensure preserved trees will not be damaged a before the start of any clearing excavation construction or other work on the site every tree designated for preservation which is located outside of any existing or required open space area or dedication shall be clearly delineated in the field the delineation markers shall remain in place for the duration of all work where deemed appropriate by the approving authority a barrier of posts and flagging or other appropriate materials may be required to be erected around protected trees a plan shall be established for the removal and disposal of brush earth and other debris in order to avoid injury to any protected tree which is to be saved b where the approval of a proposed development or other site work will result in encroachment within the drip line of a protected tree special measures shall be incorporated to allow the roots to obtain oxygen water and nutrients the director may require the applicant to provide recommendations by an arborist setting forth the measures necessary to minimize impacts to the tree c no storage of materials or substances that may be harmful to trees shall occur within the drip line of any protected tree  part   maintenance the property owner or successorsininterest shall be responsible thereafter for the care and maintenance of trees required to be planted under this chapter in a live and healthy condition the replacement of trees which may die or otherwise be destroyed is explicitly a requirement of this chapter however developed singlefamily residential lots in a new subdivision that have been sold by the developer are subject to the exemption provided in a  part   nonconforming developed parcels developed commercial or industrial parcels that are nonconforming with the treeplanting standards of shall provide treeplanting that satisfies these standards as a requirement for the issuance of a building permit for any new construction on the property that is greater than fifteen 15 percent of the existing gross floor area or an equivalent expansion of use the planning commission may reduce or waive this requirement based on a finding that conforming to the applicable treeplanting standards is not physically possible on the subject property  part   enforcement and penalty it has been determined that trees within the city are valuable assets to the community the removal or killing of any protected tree in violation of the terms of this chapter shall be punishable by either or a combination of the following means at the discretion of the city a payment of a fine of up to one thousand dollars $100000 per tree for the unauthorized removal or damage to trees b replacement of trees removed in a manner at a ratio of  twentyfour 24 inch box c prohibition of further development of the property other than corrective action measures for a period of up to two years from the date notice of the violation is given by the city the penalty shall be determined initially by the director  however appeals of his or her decision shall be available to the planning commission by filing a written appeal with the planning division within ten days of the date of delivery or mailing of the decision of the director a decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council if the appeal is submitted in writing to the city clerk within five days following the planning commissions action the fee for filing an appeal shall be the same as that required for appeals of actions related to a use permit pursuant to the zoning code  part   nonliability of city nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impose any liability for damages or a duty of care and maintenance upon the city or upon any of its officers or employees the person in possession of any private property shall have a duty to keep the

ground level or root collar on the uphill side of the tree in the case of irregularities at dbh such as swelling bumps depressions branches measure the diameter immediately above the irregularity at the place where it ceases to affect the normal stem form see figure 1 below when two trees have grown together treat them as two trees they sometimes will have the appearance of a forked tree this is very common in coastal redwood and sprouting hardwood species such trees shall be treated as separate trees and recorded as such diameter will be determined by driving in two nails halfway around the circumference from each other measuring the distance with a diameter tape and doubling the results if it is physically impossible to measure the diameter of a tree with a diameter tape because of forking or huge root collars then the diameter will be estimated as follows 1 determine where the diameter should be measured and mark it 2 using a prism or angle gauge as a guide move to a point on the ground at which the tree becomes borderline 3 measure the horizontal distance from this point on the ground to the center of the tree from that point limiting distance 4 using diameterlimiting tables look up the diameter for that limiting distance 5 record this diameter and note in comments that dbh was estimated for the tree excerpt from forest inventory and analysis users guide may 1997

purpose and methods   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of shasta lake does adopt the following floodplain management regulations 1   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of shasta lake are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effects of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss 2   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 3   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood

substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of of this chapter 6 variance procedure   nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this article of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and

construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in this chapter see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement

industrial and public development projects in order to assist site planners and designers in understanding the citys basic design expectations for onsite development these guidelines should also be applied as feasible to enhance existing structures or site conditions the intent is to enhance the communitys overall value and appearance and to achieve welldesigned projects that complement the smalltown feel of the community and its heritage in addition these design objectives are intended to 1 encourage originality flexibility innovation in site planning and development including the architecture landscaping and design of proposed developments in relation to the city as a whole andor surrounding areas 2 discourage monotonous drab unsightly dreary and inharmonious developments minimize discordant and unsightly surroundings and visual blight and avoid inappropriate and poor quality design 3 aid in assuring that structures signs and other improvements are properly related to their sites and the surrounding sites and structures with due regard to the aesthetic qualities of the natural terrain and landscaping and that proper attention is given to exterior appearances of structures signs and other improvements these objectives shall be considered during the design and review of development proposals and are to be used in conjunction with other applicable zoning development standards ordinances andor special development requirements in the event that a general design objective conflicts with a specific standard of other ordinances or codes the specific standard shall prevail the design criteria established in this section are not intended to be rigid or restrict creative solutions the planning commission at its discretion shall have the authority to consider and accept alternative site andor building designs that are determined to meet the general intent of this chapter b site design objectives 1 sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to complement adjacent structures architecture colors and sizemass 2 whenever possible buildings on the same site should be clustered and incorporate plazas courtyards pocket parks and other pedestrian use areas 3 sites should be designed to avoid the appearance of domination by automobiles positive methods to achieve this concept include a orienting buildings to fronting streets and placing parking at the rear andor sides  b designing the required parking area into smaller discrete connected lots rather than large singleuse lots  c providing welldefined pedestrian walkways areas and from public sidewalks into the site welldefined walkways use pavers changes in color texture and composition of paving materials and vertical plantings such as trees and shrubs the minimum width of walkways shall be five feet d parking areas shall be designed to be partially screened from view from adjacent streets and building occupants screening can be accomplished number of methods

accents which relate to the communitys origin in the late 1930s and 1940s are also encouraged reliance on or use of standardized corporate or franchise design prototypes that are more representative of typical urban development is strongly discouraged 2 buildings should reflect an individual design that has considered site location conditions and surrounding development building design should

within interior building spaces 15 ground level outdoor enclosures shall be composed of materials similar to the main structure 16 materials used for site features such as fences screen walls and signs should be appropriate to the zone district where the development is located and should complement building design color shape and size 17 developments should provide transition with adjacent
