building and architectural design requirements footnotes   purpose the purpose of these requirements is to implement the goals stated in the town of gypsum foundation plan as adopted by resolution on  which provides that gypsum will strive to manage the type scale and density location and timing of growth so that community infrastructure facility and service expansions can accommodate new developments without compromising quality of service goals these requirements are intended to define the desired scale and character of development within the community while not dictating an architectural style in applying these requirements staff planning commission and the town council shall focus on building mass building coverage relationships placement of new additions visual compatibility with surroundings and infill within existing neighborhoods   applicability these requirements shall apply to all building construction and exterior remodeling excluding interior remodels and changes in use these guidelines shall not apply to any nonconforming building existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter unless such structure is visually altered enlarged or expanded and such modification increases enlarges expands or results in the aggravation of the nonconforming feature or features   definitions the following design elements are defined as follows 1 context the relationship of the building to its surroundings in terms of size form color character and site development  2 massscale the appearance of the building in terms of size height bulk and building mass its proportion to surrounding landforms vegetation and buildings  3 orientation the relationship of the structure to the streetscape parking lots sidewalks surrounding structures and landforms  4

footprintfacade  variation in the roofline  addition of building elements such as balconies decks porches window patternstypes  and variation in building materialscolors   design requirements the following requirements shall apply to all existing and proposed subdivisions 1 the construction of high quality buildings and designs that will maintain their quality over time and that are functional and respective of local climatic conditions shall be promoted by addressing these design elements architectural materials and function the following shall be considered a encourage the use of durable construction materials or treatment  b roofs should be designed to minimize hazards such as snow or ice falling onto pedestrian walkways entrances decks driveways parking areas or other areas of public access  c roof overhangs projections reveals and awnings should contribute to the character of the building and create shadow patterns while aiding in protection of the structure and pedestrians  d roof style should balance compatibility with the character of the area and snow shed considerations where pitched roofs are used steeper roof pitches are preferred  however whether the roof will hold or release snow should be considered this requirement does not intend to preclude the use of flatter pitches  e building design and materials should address energy conservation of solar exposure appropriate insulation and other measures  and f building design should provide for ease of pedestrian access 2 new construction alterations or remodels shall be compatible with the visual characteristics of the area and the streetscape and shall not overwhelm or contradict its surroundings to address the design elements of context and orientation in addressing these design elements the following shall be considered a buildings should be visually harmonious with their surroundings by considering the scale proportions colors and character of adjacent structures where appropriate and should be considerate of the natural landform and landscape  b buildings should respect the character of landmark buildings in the area while not restricting the construction of new landmark structures  and c buildings and their related parking should maintain a similar setback and orientation along roads where it is a strong visual characteristic of the streetscape  and where appropriate should be oriented so that the primary presence along the street frontage is the building not the parking lot 3 designs which break up or reduce the mass of large buildings and which create an attractive facade shall be promoted to address the design elements of mass and scale and articulation and modulation the following shall be considered a building design should avoid blank walls and large unbroken expanses of walls where exposed to public view it is understood that buildings housing certain uses may not be able to meet this criteria in that instance intense landscaping and proper siting may be utilized to mitigate the visual impacts of the large building  b building design should mitigate the visual impacts of a large building mass in the facade to create offsets projections and recesses it is understood that buildings housing certain uses may not be able to meet this criteria in that instance intense landscaping and proper siting may be utilized to mitigate the visual impacts of the large building  c the appearance of massive roofs should be avoided by variation in rooflines and height the addition of dormers balconies deep eaves and overhangs may also create visual interest  d decorative roof elements should not appear to be tacked on but should be combined with other roof or wall elements to work together to create an attractive facade from all sides of the building exposed to public areas  and e building elevations should be articulated to provide visual interest without being overdone this may include variation in shape or pattern of windows variation in building materials textures and colors additional building elements such as decks balconies rails or incorporation of vertical elements and detail elements 4 roof top equipment and vents trash disposal service areas wall mechanical equipment utility facilities and other such equipment should be located away from public view or should be concealed with a treatment that is complementary to the building architecture or landscape 5 design of accessory structures and additions should be harmonious with the existing structures on the site use of complementary building materials and styles 6 building design should be unique and appropriate to this community and should not be recognizable by its architecture as a standard trademark design generic franchise architecture shall not be acceptable 7 buildings should be located to minimize negative visual impacts to the community such as skyline or ridgeline development and respecting views of significant community features from public viewpoints or streets this does not ensure the protection of private views 8 conversions of residential structures to commercial uses should maintain character compatible with the area by considering roof style building scale building orientation and lot coverage   landscaping all sites disturbed by construction and remodeling shall be revegetated and landscaped prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy xeriscape or other low water consumption designs shall be encouraged   subdivision specific design guidelines in lieu of the design requirements provided in section  the

department staff all applications shall be deemed approved if not acted upon within 30 days of submittal denial of a building permit based on the building and architectural guidelines may be appealed in accordance with the procedures described in section  flood damage prevention footnotes   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of colorado has in title 29 of the colorado revised statutes delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the town of gypsum are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these potential flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains electric and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area   interpretation in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands   applicability this chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas and areas removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a fema letter of map revision based on fill lomrf within the jurisdiction of the town of gypsum   compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be constructed located extended converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations   abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another provision of the gypsum municipal ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail
