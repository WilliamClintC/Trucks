section is satisfied all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of part  variance procedure anature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the town of pinetoplakeside to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bfloodplain review board 1the town council may establish a board of review which may be the advisory board or a committee of the advisory board to sit in review and make decisions 2the floodplain review board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 3in considering such applications the floodplain review board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and athe danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bthe danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  cthe susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  dthe importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  ethe necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  fthe availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  gthe compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  hthe relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  ithe safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jthe expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and kthe costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 4upon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this chapter the floodplain review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the regulatory flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and bsuch construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases risks to life and property  and cthe land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by ars 37610 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the navajo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance 7a person aggrieved in any manner by an action of the floodplain review board may within thirty 30 days appeal to the floodplain review board cconditions for variances 1variances shall only be issued aupon a determination that
