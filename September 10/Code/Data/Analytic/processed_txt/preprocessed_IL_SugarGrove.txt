declaration of policy the board of trustees recognizes that 1 the current state of scientific and medical knowledge concerning the effects of cannabis is at best divided with respect to the damage which is incumbent upon the use of cannabis and 2 the use of cannabis occupies the unusual position of being widely used and pervasive among the citizens of illinois despite the warnings of possible harmful effects and 3 previous legislation enacted to control or forbid the use of cannabis has often unnecessarily and unrealistically drawn a large segment of our population within the criminal justice system without succeeding in deterring the expansion of cannabis use and 4 the problems created by the use of cannabis are often local in scope and best dealt with on a local level it is therefore the policy of the board of trustees for the village in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens of the village to establish a reasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state of knowledge concerning cannabis and which directs the greatest efforts of law enforcement agencies toward the accumulation of more definitive knowledge concerning the use of cannabis toward the education of the public with regard to the possible dangers inherent in the use of cannabis and toward the prevention of commercial traffickers in cannabis b declaration of authority the board of trustees bases the authority of the instant section upon the traditional police powers granted to municipalities within the state of illinois and as well upon the statutory authorities enumerated in 65 illinois compiled statutes including but not by limitation 5115 3 with regard to preventing intoxication 511602 with regard to preventing nuisances 511429 with respect to offensive businesses 511202 with respect to beverages and food sold for human consumption 511203 with respect to food and tobacco sold for human consumption 511206 with respect to destruction of weeds and 511205 pertaining to the promotion of health and those implied powers which are necessary and proper to carry out the statutorily expressed powers further the board of trustees recognizes that it may exercise police powers on the same subject as exercised by the state so long as the exercise by the village is not inconsistent with that of the state and accordingly adopts this section in conformance with the principles announced in village of winnetka v sinnett 272 ill app 143  village of mt prospect v malouf 103 ill app 2d 88  and waller v florida 25 led2d 435  5272 definitions as

trees wetlands and other natural resources b these provisions are intended to encourage and accommodate more creative and imaginative design for land development than would otherwise be possible under the strict application of sugar groves conventional zoning and subdivision ordinance provisions c implementation of this chapter will result in efficient land patterns and therefore more economical land development that 1 fosters high quality development by allowing flexibility in land use and design standards thereby encouraging innovative site planning  2 promotes more efficient land patterns which not only preserve open space and natural resources but also provide for more economical networks of utilities streets and other facilities  3 promotes diverse high quality residential environments which include a mixture of dwelling unit types  4 promotes a land use pattern with a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses that will mutually support each other  5 provides for the permanent preservation of open space for the continued use and enjoyment of residents of each subdivision and the village  6 provides usable and suitably located public and private recreational facilities  7 encourages developers to provide amenities that enhance the quality of life both within the planned unit development as well as within the community as a whole  8 encourages a land use pattern which promotes the public health safety comfort morals and welfare  9 allows more than one building per zoning lot when determined to be of benefit to the residents of a proposed subdivision

uses the village has established more specific procedures and standards and criteria for exceptions from regulations of the underlying zoning district than those included in chapter 13 of this title procedures standards and criteria for exceptions which follow are intended to guide the recommendations of the planning commissionzoning board of appeals and village board during their review of preliminary and final plans b 3202018 11113 permitted uses planned unit developments may include uses and structures not otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district provided landscape

intended and shall not be used as a means to circumvent the procedures or standards of the zoning and subdivision control ordinances and thereby allow a lower standard of development than otherwise

scale projects to provide more open space and recreational opportunities than would otherwise be required to promote the protection of high quality natural resources and to establish better transitions between dissimilar land uses 3 the unique characteristics of the area and the uniqueness of the approach to development will determine the degree of flexibility afforded from regulations

if land is not needed or practical in a development the developer is required to donate cash in lieu of land in an amount determined per the criteria set forth in this chapter the village requires that the land dedicated be nonflood high dry land the land should be free from any storm water detention or retention basins or lakes however the village will also accept storm water basins and lakes when they meet the criteria set forth in this chapter and prove to have a public recreational benefit that offsets the perpetual maintenance responsibilities that would be assumed by the village the village feels that the acceptance of these retention and detention areas is an equal tradeoff to the perpetual maintenance responsibility and therefore no credit toward landcash obligations will be given if these areas are accepted for maintenance responsibility by the village it is the villages policy to not accept stand alone detention or retention facilities the village will consider the acceptance of these facilities when designed with a functional required park b the following criteria shall be applied to property dedicated to the village pursuant to this chapter 1 all land must be
