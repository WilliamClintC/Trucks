inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm

traffic volumes from subparagraph 2c to describe mainline and turning movement volumes for future conditions with the site developed as the applicant proposes analysis of future conditions with development this section describes the adequacy of the roadway system to accommodate future traffic with development of the site daily and peak hours traffic volumes provide mainline and turning movement volumes for the highway network in the study area as well as driveways and internal circulation roadways for the appropriate time periods volumecapacity analyses at critical points perform a volumecapacity analysis for the appropriate peak hours for future conditions with the site developed as proposed similar to subparagraphs 3b2 and 3b3 levels of service at critical points as a result of the volumecapacity analysis compute and describe the level of service on the study area roadway system final design must address both traffic flow and traffic safety considerations to provide safe operational characteristics recommended improvements in the event that the analysis indicates unsatisfactory levels of service will occur on study area roadways a description of proposed improvements to remedy deficiencies should be included in this section these proposals would not include committed projects by the state and local jurisdictions proposed recommended improvements describe the

the present the type of housing in the borough changed substantially from that found in the central core of the borough to that found in those areas other than the central core the primary type of housing previously was singlefamily detached dwellings on small lots such dwellings were constructed of wood or similar materials with vary small yards that changed in the 1950s and continues to this day so that almost all the construction of singlefamily detached dwellings has been on substantially larger lots 12000 square feet or more and a substantial number of those dwellings have been built of brick stone or masonry and have significant setbacks and yards the purpose of the r1 district is to recognize the historical evolution of those types of dwellings in those areas and to preserve that legitimate dwelling type for future generations the borough has made adequate provisions for other types of dwellings in its other districts and believes that the preservation of singlefamily detached dwellings on what are relatively large lots although quite small compared to surrounding municipalities and surrounding townships is a legitimate community development objective of the borough that shall be pursued to this end the borough has created the r1 zoning district where the only permitted residential use is singlefamily detached dwellings on larger lots 12500 square feet or more and only those other uses that encourage the open use of space so to    additionally businesses in these areas should be severally restricted so that they do not create any kind of intrusion on this legitimate residential usage  27702 permitted uses in the r1 district a   702 as amended by 142018  and by 82019 singlefamily detached dwellings parks and playgrounds not operated for private

been rezoned as r1 and is not part of the new zoning district r3 the purpose of the r2 zoning district is to provide a transition between the r1 and the r3 to reflect a different legitimate housing need and to also reflect a different currently existing housing type the housing types in the r2 district consist of mixtures of singlefamily detached and multifamily the density however is much higher than in the r1 the borough believes that the essential character of the r2 district should be preserved by allowing singlefamily detached dwellings as of right and other types of nondense residential uses as special exceptions not have significant lot size requirements and setbacks should be significantly smaller then in the r1 but because of the already built up nature of most of this area it is important that parking and similar issues be addressed again the primary purpose of the district is residential dwelling therefore commercial uses should be restricted so to not impose an unnecessary burden on the residential uses these community development objectives are legitimate and shall be implemented in the borough  27802 permitted uses in the r2 district a   802  as amended by

5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a   1001 the borough of akron being a community created well over 100 years ago significantly prior to zoning found the evolution of its industrial uses dependent more on foot and rail traffic than anything else accordingly in 199 there are at most three operating industrial establishments left in the borough none of which are of any size and all which are scattered at locations and in buildings where similar uses existed for well over 40 years because of the extreme density of residential development in the borough and the lack of land for any size of industrial use the borough believes it would be illadvised to allow major industrial uses to be permitted the borough with its history of experiencing some industrial uses in the middle of residential districts has found that these existing industrial uses in residential areas have caused significant problems there is no other land on which to build any kind of substantial industrial use additionally any substantial industrial use would significantly intrude upon the residential bedroom community character of the borough accordingly the borough has eliminated the very small industrial district from its zoning all the land in that district is now occupied by commercial uses but will allow the provision of light industry of a limited nature within its c1 district the c1 districts primary purpose however is for commercial development along the transportation corridor of route 272 towards that end residential development in that area should be discouraged and the intermixing of residential commercial and industrial should be prevented to the greatest extent possible accordingly the borough has rezoned a significant portion of both sides of route 272 for commercial uses so to encourage those uses along that transportation corridor where there can be access to them by the traveling public from adjacent municipalities these community development objectives are legitimate and shall be implemented in the borough  271002 permitted uses in the c1 district a   1002  as amended by 142018  and by 82019 municipal building essential services structures parks and playgrounds not operated

but encourages the mixtures of such residential uses and smaller scale commercial uses this mixed density area is not intended to be or consist of substantially all commercial uses but is intended to be intermixed where nonintrusive commercial uses can live in peace with higher density residential uses to that end the commercial uses are not as intense as those allowed in the c1 district also to that end the residential uses are not as restrictive as that provided in the r1 and r2 districts the intent is to reserve the old pretwentieth century main street character as it has been the essential core of the borough the housing types in this section of the borough are generally those built prelate 1950s and consist of the more traditional small lots small yards large size residential
