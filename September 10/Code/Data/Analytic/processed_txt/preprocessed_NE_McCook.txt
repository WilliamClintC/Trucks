1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 1943 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area therefore the city council of the city of mccook red willow county nebraska ordains as follows 2 findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city of mccook red willow county nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this ordinance it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  as amended 2 calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot 1 at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile in flood height 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood city of mccook nebraska zoning ordinance no 20162929 page  63 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in 2a by applying the provisions of this ordinance to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program general provisions 1 lands to which this ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of mccook

limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes 7 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice

vision are only permitted by the application for and grant of a variance note given modern complex nature of messages conveyed by on premise signs the sign regulations distinguishes between primary and secondary copy it is important to note however that this distinction is not scientific rather it reflects a public policy modification the secondary copy requirements are not designed to produce copy that may be read by automobiles passing at the posted speed limit rather such copy will likely only be readable to pedestrians and idling or parked cars given the limited value of secondary copy the city of mccook encourages sign owners to use it sparingly note electronic message centers are a relatively new sign type that has not fully been explored by the scientific community given the rising popularity of this sign type as well as efforts by some municipalities to block their installation the aforementioned emc requirements have been drafted to permit the use of the sign type while seeking to lessen the potential impacts or perceived impacts they cause the choice to allow the construction of static emcs in residential areas only is a public policy decision communities must
