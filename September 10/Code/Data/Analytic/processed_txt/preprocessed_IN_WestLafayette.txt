  governs stormwater runoff erosion and sediment control  background a the common council of the city on  adopted which established the city of west lafayette drainage  in order to govern the control of runoff of stormwater and to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of the land in the city and its water resources this primarily targeted at stormwater discharge quantity and erosion and sediment control b on  phase ii of the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program was published in the federal register the npdes program as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the clean water act controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the united states phase ii of npdes requires permit coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s and for small construction activity that results in the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre this federal regulation went into effect  in response to phase ii of npdes the state department of environmental management enacted rule 13 327 iac 1513 and revised rule 5 327 iac 155 c under these new state and federal regulations the city is required to establish a regulatory mechanism for stormwater quality management therefore the city of west lafayette drainage  was expanded to include stormwater quality in addition to quantity prior    findings the city finds that 1 water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding  2 flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the region  3 land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  4 soil erosion resulting from landdisturbing activities causes a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported offsite and deposited in ditches streams wetlands lakes and reservoirs  5 increases of stormwater runoff rates soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city  6 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources  7 illicit discharges have occurred as a result of illegal dumping and direct connections of nonstormwater flows and have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city  8 continued pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the city will absent reasonable regulation monitoring and enforcement adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources  9 stormwater runoff soil erosion nonpoint source pollution and illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater management  10 adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained and referenced in this implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and

the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility the primary outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir determined according to the onsite runoff only once the size and location of the primary outlet structure as well as the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir is determined by considering onsite runoff the 100year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire inflow onsite and offsite pond b note that the efficiency of the detentionretention facility in controlling the onsite runoff may be severely affected if the offsite area is considerably larger than the onsite area as a general guidance online detention may not be effective in controlling onsite runoff where the ratio of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  additional detention above and beyond that required for onsite area may be required by the city when the ratio of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  5 downstream restrictions a

adjacent stream with more than 100 square miles of contributing drainage area at the direct release point therefore direct release may be allowed for parcels adjacent to the following stream reaches in the city wabash riverthe entire reach within the county b due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the associated proposed stormwater management systems within a watershed it is the policy of the city to discourage direct release to a stream with less than 100 square miles of contributing drainage area at the direct release point however in rare circumstances where a comprehensive watershedwide hydrologic study or watershed plan of a major stream adopted by the city substantiates the benefits of or allows for direct release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream the detention requirements set in subsection a7a of this section may be waived c in substantiating the potential benefits of direct release the watershedwide hydrologic study provided by the applicant must demonstrate that the peak discharge associated with twoyear tenyear and 100year precipitation events would not increase along the receiving stream at a minimum the stream reach to be examined needs to extend from the direct release point to a point downstream with a drainage area at least ten times the drainage area of the proposed development and its offsite

project site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area 3 all activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest practical period of time during development 4 the length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to reduce erosion potential drainage channels and swales must be designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant

amenities 1 general existing features which would add value to residential development or to the participating jurisdiction as a whole such as trees watercourses and falls beaches historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets shall be preserved wherever possible in the design of the subdivision nonresidential subdivisions 1 general it is recognized that the subdivider in creating a nonresidential subdivision faces problems of lot design not normally encountered in residential subdivisions for this reason the initial emphasis of the commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement the procedural requirements for sketch plan and for primary approval are as provided in section 10103 except that the subdivider need show only the proposed street and block layout subsequently as prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required specifications the subdivider may then submit for secondary approval a final subdivision plat or plats which may show lot lines other than those shown at time of primary approval in the case of a major subdivision and sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision the procedural requirements of the commission following the receipt of a final subdivision plat shall then apply except that where public improvements were built following a previously approved set of construction plans public improvements then need not be reconstructed because of the adoption of new criteria by a participating jurisdiction this shall also apply to storm drainage facilities within said subdivision unless runoff characteristics are to be changed or in the event that unauthorized existing improvements have altered conditions 2 standards a nonresidential subdivisions must be appropriately zoned for business or industry prior to the proposal for a subdivision under this section b if a nonresidential subdivision has received secondary approval any replatting of lots may take place following the minor subdivision provisions of this ordinance there shall be no limit on the number of minor subdivisions within the original plat c all nonresidential subdivisions shall be served by approved sewer and water facilities by individual wells onsite sewage disposal facilities or some combination thereof as approved by the appropriate authorities multifamily subdivisions 1 general unless otherwise excluded under section a of the definition of subdivision or under the provisions for parcelization indicated in section 101035 of this ordinance the development of more than one multifamily structure on a single ownership lot constitutes a subdivision of land as defined herein yet the creation of a separate lot for each principal use building that is each multifamily structure poses unique and complex problems for the subdivider of land to be so used many of the standards set forth in the unified zoning ordinance to be applied to individual residential lots cannot be met without destroying the unifying concept of a welldesigned complex of multifamily structures most notable among these standards are lot size frontage and setback requirements all of which assume a progression of uniform lots along a roadway more typical of single family and some duplex developments despite these difficulties associated with the subdivision of land for multifamily development the purposes of this ordinance as listed in section 101013 must be met thus with regard to proposed multifamily subdivisions the emphasis of the commission shall be on the number of principal use buildings the number of proposed dwelling units and required parking spaces and the provision of required public improvements to this end the necessity of placing interior lot lines on sketch plans and preliminary and final plats shall be at the subdividers option so long as all principal use buildings and all accessory buildings remain in the ownership or leasehold of a single entity that option shall be revoked at such time as the ownership or leasehold of fewer than all such buildings is to be transferred to another entity such transfer shall necessitate a resubdivision of the affected property complete with appropriate lot lines 2 procedural requirements and submission specifications a multifamily subdivisions must be appropriately zoned for multifamily structures prior to the proposal for a subdivision under this section b the subdivider of land to be used for the development of multifamily structures shall adhere to the procedural requirements and submission specifications for sketch plans and preliminary and final plats as provided in sections 10103 and 10106 of this ordinance except as follows i the number of principal use buildings and the number of proposed dwelling units and required parking spaces shall be indicated on sketch plans and preliminary and final plats  ii the subdivider may opt to omit interior lot lines under the circumstances indicated in section 10105121  and iii no multifamily subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing street on the official map or if there be no official map unless such street is a an existing state county or local highway or a street either shown upon a plat approved by the commission and recorded by the county recorder or recorded by the county recorder prior to february 1965 such street or highway must be suitably improved and accepted for public maintenance or be secured by a performance bond required under this ordinance wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage the half of the road fronting the subdivision shall be suitably improved as provided for in section 10105123ai or section 10105123aii as follows  or b a street platted as a part of the multifamily subdivision c should the subdivider exercise the option of omitting interior lot lines the standards of the unified zoning ordinance shall be applied to the entire tract that is the entire tract will be treated as one lot subject to all restrictions and requirements of the unified zoning ordinance pertaining to multifamily dwellings on a single lot in effect this will permit the placement of more than one principal use building on a single lot should there be a necessity to resubdivide as would occur in the event of a transfer of ownership or leasehold of fewer than all principal use and accessory buildings the standards of the unified zoning ordinance for multifamily dwellings shall be applied to each and every separate lot so created resubdivision process  variances may be sought from the appropriate board of zoning appeals 3 requirements for improvements a the subdivider of land to be so used for the development of multifamily structures shall be subject to the requirements of section 10105 of this ordinance except as follows i widening and realignment of existing and proposed arterials where a multifamily subdivision borders an existing narrow arterial or when the comprehensive plan thoroughfare plan or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening an adjacent arterial that would require use of some land in the subdivision the subdivider shall be required to dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such arterials where any portion of a multifamily subdivision abuts any such arterial that arterial shall be improved only to onehalf of the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance if the site is transected by an existing arterial which the comprehensive plan thoroughfare plan or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening the subdivider shall be required to dedicate rightofway for such arterial where any portion of a multifamily subdivision abuts any such arterial that arterial shall be improved to the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance where an arterial proposed in the comprehensive plan or thoroughfare plan borders or transects a proposed subdivision the necessary rightofway shall be reserved as provided for in section 101059 of this ordinance ii widening and realignment of existing and proposed collectors and local roads where a multifamily subdivision borders an existing narrow collector or local road or when the comprehensive plan thoroughfare plan or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening an adjacent collector or local road that would require use of some land in the subdivision the subdivider shall be required to dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such collectors or local roads where any portion of a multifamily subdivision abuts any such collector or local road that collector or local road shall be improved to onehalf of the full width of that designated facility as required by this ordinance if the site is transected by an existing collector or local road which the comprehensive plan thoroughfare plan or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening the subdivider shall be required to dedicate rightofway for such collector or local road where any portion of a multifamily subdivision abuts any such collector or local road that collector or local road shall be improved to the full width of that facility respectively as required by this ordinance iii in the event of

consistent with both the adopted comprehensive plan and the intent of the unified zoning and subdivision ordinances to achieve this the commission does not apply any other provisions of this chapter or below instead the commission staff negotiates a specific development plan with the petitioner for pd zoning and representatives of the checkpoint agencies the combined elements of this negotiated plan rather than zone regulations then become the subject of the rezoning process all restrictions and regulations for a specific planned development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself having been arrived at prior to rezoning pd zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land on small or large tracts b the commissions goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential nonresidential and mixeduse developments to meet the needs of this community to help create attractive healthful efficient and stable places to live shop and work the commission encourages use of pd zoning within the following contexts 1 to accommodate compatible development in environmentally sensitive locations  2 to enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses  3 to permit a harmonious variety of uses within a single development  4 to promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures andor by using shared facilities or services  5 to foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones 2282 origination of proposals a a request to rezone from any other zoning classification to pd may be initiated by 1 all owners of the property in question  or 2 any group of owners united in interest acting jointly in pursuance to an agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership b because of the unified design of a planned development and because the combined elements of the negotiated plan are the substance of the zone itself this ordinance requires that a request to reclassify from pd to pd shall include amongst the petitioners either 1 all owners of the property within the current planned development  or unified zoning ordinance 3rd edition 105 228 planned development zones contd pd pd 2 the

occupancy permits for all parts no less than three years prior  or b the conversion to condominium ownership of an existing building in a cb or cbw zone or in a pd zone adjoining or surrounded by a cb

principles control the computation of sign area and sign setback a the area of a sign face which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face is computed as the smallest square circle rectangle or triangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the entire message together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed but not including any supporting framework bracing or decorative fence or wall when that fence or wall otherwise meets ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself b the sign area for a sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point where 2 identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time and where such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not farther apart than half the length of the sign the sign area is computed by the measurement of one of the faces amend 20 unified zoning ordinance 3rd edition 179 c the permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a signlot is computed as per 483b for the zone in which the lot is located for lots fronting on 2 or more streets the area of all individual signs permitted on each

approval of a sign permit  special conditions may apply in some cases where the letter n appears for a sign type in a row that sign type is not allowed in the zone represented by the intersecting column under any circumstances b signs designated in 484 by an a or a p are then allowed but only if 1 the sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs on the signlot conforms to the maximum permitted sign area as determined for the zone in which the lot is located as specified in the table in 485  2 the number area size and setback of signs on the signlot conform to the requirements of the table in 486 which establishes permitted sign dimensions for freestanding signs setback is always measured from the edge of the rightofway to the leading edge of the sign  3 the maximum permitted

than 15000 sqfeet  sign area assurance is calculated as 02% of that ground floor area 002 x gfa 2 ifa primary use building in any other commercial zone or in any industrial zone has a ground floor area of more than 20000 sqfeet  sign area assurance is calculated as 02% of that ground floor area 002 x ground floor area b similarly one is limited to a maximum amount of signage called a sign area cap this comes into use when the calculated maximum sign area per signlot exceeds 6% of the ground floor area of the primary use building signage is then limited to 6% of gfa c an institutional land

length of a uses frontage the greater of the speed limits shall be used amend 20 appendix unified zoning ordinance 3rd edition 277 e where a signlot has no actual street frontage the road speed limit multiplier is derived from that of the adjoining road or roads from which the primary use derives its access at that point of access f frontage along i65 does not count in this calculation g if the speed limit increases after signs are installed permitted sign area may be recalculated and increased if the speed limit decreases there shall be no requirement to reduce sign area h building setback
