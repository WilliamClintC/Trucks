private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the village board based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the village and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the developer shall guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents private swimming clubs are included in this provision when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total park land

equal to the amount of the original contribution not expended divided by the total number of lots in the development excluding only those lots which were dedicated pursuant to the provisions hereof for which such contribution was made the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated pursuant to the provisions hereof it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is one hundred ninety thousand

2 bedroom  3 bedroom or more  for all developments in which the population density cannot be precisely determined at the time of approval of the development the land donation requirement shall be determined as follows the ultimate population shall be calculated on the basis of four 4 bedrooms and one acre per detached singlefamily unit which the village board hereby determines to the current trend in such development within the village  and the bedroom mix used for singlefamily attached and multiplefamily dwelling units shall be based upon the number of units and mix of bedrooms as indicated on the approved final plan and plat of planned unit development in the event a developer files a written objection to one or more of the tables formulas andor determinations pursuant to this section he shall submit his own study showing the estimated ultimate population and in that event final determination of the formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board based upon such information submitted by the developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board it is recognized that population density age distribution and local conditions change over time and the specific formula for the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu thereof as stated herein is subject to periodic review and amendment as necessary 4 reservation of
