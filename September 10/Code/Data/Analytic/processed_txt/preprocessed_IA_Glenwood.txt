and operating characteristics cc districts are appropriate at major intersections at the junction of several neighborhoods or at substantial commercial subcenters dc downtown commercial this district is intended to provide appropriate development regulations for downtown glenwood mixed uses are encouraged within the dc district the grouping of uses is designed to strengthen the town centers role as a center for trade service and civic life gc general commercial this district accommodates a variety of commercial uses some of which have significant traffic or visual effect these districts may include commercial uses which are oriented to services including automotive services rather than retail activities these uses may create land use conflicts with adjacent residential areas requiring provision of adequate buffering this district is most appropriately located along major arterial streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential districts hc highway gateway

different uses are permitted with different conditions these are displayed in table 1682 the matrix of permitted uses levels of permission include a uses which are permitted by right these uses are permitted subject to issuance of a building permit by building official subject only to compliance with all regulations of this permitted by right might be subject to supplemental regulations contained in this uses are indicated in the use matrix by a p in the applicable cell b conditional uses these uses are subject to approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission following the procedure set forth in these uses are indicated in the use matrix by a c in the applicable cell conditional uses with intensity ratings of m moderate h high or i intensive require attainment of a requisite number of performance points these uses require special site of development features and amenities in excess of the minimum requirements in certain zoning district because of their scale neighborhood impact or other potential external effects the procedure for determination of performance points is set forth in c site plan approval some use types require a site plan approval by the building official based on specific criteria for review this procedure is set forth in these uses are indicated in the use matrix by an asterisk  following the citing of a specific use type 16813 guide to site development regulators the regulators set forth in table 1683 establish the limits and requirements for most development in the city of glenwood this section is intended to provide guidance for applying the regulators contained in these tables a site are per housing unit this indicates the gross land area per unit within a residential development for example a 40 lot subdivision on a 10 acre 435600 square foot tract will have a site area per unit of 10890 square feet site area per unit which measures gross density may differ from minimum lot size in conservation development the site area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size permitting the clustering of lots in exchange for common open space in multifamily development the site area per unit will usually be smaller that minimum lot size because the lot is the legal parcel on which a multipleunit building is built zoning district regulations city of glenwood  land development b minimum lot area this indicates the minimum size of a legally described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place as noted above minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same c minimum lot width this is the required minimum distance connecting at points along opposite side lot lines measured at the required front yard setback for example the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring a 25foot front yard setback is determined by 1 locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25feet back from the front property line 2 drawing a line connecting these two 2 points 3 measuring the length of this line and the length is the lot width d minimum yards these define the required setbacks of buildings from front side and near property lines while the yard requirements apply to a majority of development the for a number of exceptions some of these include 1 planned developments front yard setbacks can be varied within planned developments which are reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission 2 flexibility provided by supplemental development regulations establishes supplement regulations many of which provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts 3 maximum setbacks some specific zoning districts provide maximum as well as minimum setbacks these setbacks establish buildto lines which may be necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts e maximum height height normally measures the vertical distance from the established grade to the highest point of a building however as established by the definition of height the point of measurement may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes f maximum building coverage this measures the percentage of a site that many be covered by the footprint of buildings thus a 20000 square foot building on a 40000 square foot site has a building coverage of 50% this is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area g maximum impervious coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground such as driveways porches parking lots zoning district regulations city of glenwood  land development other features limits on impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of stormwater runoff and provide for groundwater recharge h floor area ratio just as site area per unit controls the density of residential development floor area ratio far controls the density of nonresidential development far is the ratio of gross floor area of a building to total site area thus in an area with a maximum permitted far of 10 a 40000 square foot building may be located on a 40000 square foot sire naturally because of coverage ratios landscaping and parking requirements such a building will be multistory i maximum amount of total parking in street yard this controls the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building faade and the street when applied in certain zoning districts it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from the street encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and side yards and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and streets for example a project with 100 parking stalls and a 50% limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure j minimum width of residential structures this controls the minimum width for any residential building structure elevations which shall be not les than twenty 20 feet in width in all residential zones k minimum floor area for residential structures this controls the minimum floor area for each residential structure any residential structure shall contain not less than seven hundredfifty 750 square feet of enclosed

purpose the pd planned development overlay district is intended to provide flexibility in the design i of planned projects to permit innovation in project design that incorporates open space and other amenities  and to insure compatibility of developments with the surrounding urban environment planned developments often involve groupings of buildings or sites that are designed as an integrated unit om land under unified control or ownership at the time of grant of development permission the requirements of a pd run with the land regardless of the subsequent sale of conveyance of property the pd district may be used in combination with any base district specified in this pd district which is adopted by the city council with the recommendation of the planning commission assures specific development standards for each designated project  permitted uses uses permitted in a pd overlay district are those permitted in the underlying base district a pd also may be combined with an mu mixed use district to allow a combination of use types not anticipated by conventional base districts  objectives of planned development districts in evaluating applications for pd planned development overlay districts the planning commission and city council shall consider the following general objectives a residential pd districts residential pd planned districts should be designed to produce more usable open space provide better recreation opportunities enhance pedestrian scale protect or create neighborhood amenities and environmental features and produce more attractive neighborhoods than those produced by conventional development techniques b commercial pd districts commercial pd districts should be designed to produce more attractive and functional clusters and commercial centers than the strip development that is frequently produced by the application of conventional zoning regulations techniques encouraged by pd districts include consolidated access shard parking consistent architectural quality improved pedestrian and trail access to commercial facilities public space and integrated landscaping and signage programs special and overlay districts city of glenwood  land development c industrial pd districts industrial pd districts should promote the establishment of industrial parks and to encourage groups of industrial buildings with integrated sire design and architectural and landscaping themes d pd districts in sensitive contexts pd districts may be utilized to provide a high level of detail and define the requirements of project approval for developments proposed within settings that are so sensitive that normal zoning requirements including landscaping and buffering requirements do not provide sufficient protection for neighboring properties  site development regulations site development regulations are developed individually for each planned development district but must comply with the minimum or maximum standards established for the base district with the following exceptions a lot area and lot width are not restricted provided that the maximum density allowed for each base district is not exceeded b maximum building

losses resulting from periodic inundation flood hazard areas of the city of glenwood iowa are subject to inundation which results in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general

flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 2 methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is special and overlay districts city of glenwood  land development in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one 1% percent chance of occurrence in any one year ad delineated by applicable flood insurance studies and the federal emergency management administrations flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of this ordinance and adopted by the city of glenwood b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but
