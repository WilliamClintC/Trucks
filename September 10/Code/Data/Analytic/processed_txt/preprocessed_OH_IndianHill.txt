a designated height in no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community 2the floodway is an extremely hazardous area and is usually characterized by any of the following moderate to high velocity flood waters high potential for debris and projectile impacts and moderate to high erosion forces freeboard  a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a

continuous and ongoing planning process designed to implement the intent and purpose of the village charter and to protect the health safety and welfare of the present and future residents of the village the plan addresses the types and intensities of land uses and the system of roadways that are consistent with the villages charter objective of maintaining its rural character and protecting its unique natural environment as such the plan not only addresses future conditions but also affirms prior land use policies as implemented villages existing zoning code that continue to achieve the villages charter objective of remaining a ruralresidential community the plan addresses the issues of land use and environmental protection in terms of current knowledge of existing conditions as this plan is implemented and new conditions arise the plan may be reviewed and if necessary modified to reflect the villages informed response to the new circumstances 80 01 res 1586 passed 61686  15202 topographical characteristics athe village comprises 195 square miles and is bounded on the east and the south by the little miami river with village boundaries that roughly correspond to the physical break between the river bottom lands and the steeply sloping valley walls to the west the village boundaries are defined by the municipal corporate limits of montgomery madeira and mariemont to the north the village limits are defined by i275 there is a general gradient toward the river with the highest and most level land being located on the west and the lowest land located in the river bottoms most of the area is divided by ravines and stream valleys which form the areas drainage pattern in the north sycamore creeks three branches divide the northern half of the village into a series of natural neighborhoods walton creek redbird hollow and smaller streams paralleling indian hill shawnee run kugler mill and camargo roads also break up the community into a series of smaller natural neighborhood areas bthe most rugged terrain in the village is nearest the little miami river on the steeper slopes unstable soil conditions are found in a geologic formation known as the kope formation these conditions are most in evidence along sycamore creek and along the little miami river construction on these areas or above them should not be permitted other major environmental features such as woodlands steep slopes and ravines are likely to physically overlap although woodlands are also frequently found in the flatter upland areas as well most of the scenic views in the village are views across the ravines and stream valleys while the bottoms of ravines and stream valleys provide scenic drives a complete inventory of the villages topographical characteristics and environmental resources is detailed in the villages green areas study december 1977 which is hereby incorporated by reference in this plan 80 02 res 1586 passed 61686  15203 charter objective awhen the village was incorporated in 194 the village was a rural neighborhood of farms and singlefamily homes situated at the outer edge of the cincinnati metropolitan area the villages to the west of this village were also mostly rural but gradually becoming suburban in character it was the vision of the framers of the village charter that the village should maintain its rural character consistent with this objective the village fathers recognized the need for a transition from these communities to the west by providing for a gradual decrease in density along portions of the western border subsequent village annexations and land use decisions were consistent with this pattern of decreasing density bthis transition in intensity of development and the topographical characteristics described above define two logical gradients in the village both of which generally flow from west to east these two gradients are shown in the land use map which is attached to this plan and made a part hereof the village has continued to serve as a natural and logical geographical area of rural relief to the increasing sprawl of the cincinnati suburbs the village is located along a major physical boundary the little miami river and its stream valleys and steep ravines are ideally suited for lowdensity development the expanse of the village gives it an appropriate size for maintaining the desired rural character and providing rural relief within the metropolitan area 80 03 res 1586 passed 61686  15204 roadway system ainterstate highways i275 i71 and major arterials run to the west north east and south of the village the major arterials are montgomery road us 22 state route 3 and wooster pike us 50 together these interstate highways and major arterials provide for needed regional access within the village itself there are only three minor arterials and one major collector which are suitable for traffic movement between local streets and the regional roadway network two of these minor arterials that run in an eastwest direction are remington road and shawnee run road the major collector indian hill road also runs in an eastwest direction the third minor arterial is lovelandmadeira it angles village in a northeasterly direction these roads run past the boundaries of the village and intersect with the major regional highways consequently there is no need to use these roads to travel village to reach other destinations within the metropolitan area these minor arterials and other roadways within the village should be maintained and improved for the purpose of traffic safety but not to increase capacity or to encourage their use by bbecause of the existing roadway pattern there are no logical roadway corridors within the village that are suitable for more intense uses the three minor arterial roads and major collector all have rural crosssections trees and ditches are located close to the pavements this condition provides for pleasing scenic views but lowers the carrying capacity of these roads the low land use intensities proposed for the village are consistent with the low volumes and low capacities of the road network the existing roadway system therefore is an important component of and thus contributes to the rural quality the village seeks to maintain 80 04 res 1586 passed 61686  15205 density pattern of residential land use ain furtherance of its stated charter objective of maintaining its original rural character the village adopted in 1983 specific land use objectives and policies these adopted land use objectives and policies may 1983 are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this plan bthe village is not only a rural community but also a community of singlefamily residences as indicated in the land use map the land use pattern that will most effectively meet the villages adopted land use objectives and policies is one which maintains the vast majority of the community at a density of 2 dwelling units per acre or five acres per dwelling unit this planned density is identified as rural estate on the land use map the rural estate area runs along the eastern border of the village and becomes broader as it goes north along the western fork of sycamore creek the rural estate area is uninterrupted from the western to eastern borders of the village the broader area thus serves to protect the majority of the sycamore creek area that dominates the northern portion of the village this density pattern in conjunction with the implementation of the villages adopted resource protection policies and careful attention to landscape design will insure the preservation of the villages rural character as the dominant and unifying element of the villages land use plan cin addition the plan shows a moderate area of one dwelling unit per acre density which should be limited to the southwest area of the village where it adjoins the city of madeira the city of cincinnati columbia township and the village of mariemont this density is identified as suburban estate on the land use map north of the rural estate land surrounding sycamore creek two much smaller areas adjoining the city of montgomery near perin road and spooky ridge lane are also designated for suburban estate on the land use map adjoining the suburban estate land area in the southern part of the village should be an area of 3 dwelling units per acre three acres per dwelling unit this planned density is identified as estate on the land use map the plan shows much smaller areas of estate in the more rural northern portion of the village again generally surrounding the suburban estate particularly along blome and remington roads the suburban estate and estate land areas represent a logical transition in intensity of land use to communities to the west  however they cannot be significantly expanded without causing an adverse effect upon the rural community character of the village 80 05 res 1586 passed 61686  15206 other land uses the only nonresidential areas in the village are schools public and private municipal buildings churches and recreational or cultural facilities the introduction of commercial office or industrial uses into the village would destroy its ruralresidential character the surrounding jurisdictions of montgomery kenwood madeira and milford provide adequate shopping and other commercial services for the needs of the residents of the village and of the surrounding area the remoteness from congested commercial centers is part of the rural living environment of the village no commercial uses except necessary public utility buildings needed to serve the village residents should be permitted 80 06 res 1586 passed 61686  15207 regional land use function because the village from its inception has acted to maintain its rural character the suburban growth and sprawl in the cincinnati metropolitan area has leapfrogged over the village the rural enclave that the village has preserved now serves an important regional function by preserving in open space some of the rougher topographical areas of the region and enhancing the character of the more densely settled surrounding communities by breaking up the relatively uniform pattern of suburban development in the metropolitan area the village provides needed contrast in land use and open space and thereby contributes to the rural quality of neighboring communities and the region thus these developed areas that surround the village are able to borrow open space that has been preserved villages planning policies residents of the adjoining unincorporated residential areas to the northeast who choose to drive village on their way to and from work benefit from the perception that they live in a more rural environment these benefits are obtained solely as the result of the villages land use policies 80 07 res 1586 passed 61686  15208 consistency of land use decisions with plan the land use plan is adopted by resolution of the city council together with the villages land use objectives and policies and the green areas study it is intended to provide a coherent land use planning framework for the villages use in making land use decisions the land use plan is advisory only however by adoption of this plan it is the city councils intent that the land use decisionmaking process shall include careful consideration of the extent to which proposed land use changes are consistent with the land use plan the city planning commission shall consult the land use plan in determining whether or not to grant special exceptions to the zoning code and in making its findings of fact and recommendations to the city council with respect to zoning amendments it is also the intent of the city council that the zoning code of the village and any amendment to it shall not be inconsistent with the villages land use plan 80 08 res 1586 passed 61686  15209 interpretation any question regarding the interpretation of this land use plan as well as its implementation will be resolved by the city council 80 09 res 1586 passed 61686 chapter 153 soil erosion and sediment control
