requirements account groups are a reporting device to account for certain assets and liabilities of the governmental funds not recorded directly in those funds governmental funds are used to account

measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting under the modified accrual basis of accounting revenues are recognized when susceptible to accrual ie when they are measurable and available measurable means the amount of the transaction can be determined and available means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period

service fund are recognized under the susceptible to accrual concept licenses and permits charges for services fines and forfeitures and miscellaneous revenues except earnings on investments are

are promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency for certain industries the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected industrial user a violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this division b applicability of more stringent discharge limits an industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules 1 if the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed herein or by a discharge permit issued hereunder because the united states environmental protection agency requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entitys wastewater pretreatment program the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail 2 the environmental services official is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection 1 to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits if the industrial user already has a discharge permit the environmental services official may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits an industrial user shall submit to the environmental services official an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes 3 if the environmental services official chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection 2 the environmental services official shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended an industrial user shall be given a reasonable

official grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the united states environmental protection agency d authority to regulate the environmental services official may establish regulations not in conflict with this division or other laws to control the disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to insure compliance with the citys pretreatment enforcement program and with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the united states

town that the developer shall inventory site conditions and environs both natural and manmade and shall provide appropriate protection of these elements prior to approval of the planned development district the district is further designed to allow the city council greater control over the development of areas adjacent to residential districts application an application for a planned development

townhousecondominium purpose of district because of the newness of townhouses condominiums cluster houses and other such housing concepts in addison and because such housing does not fall into any existing residential zoning district the town of addison finds that a set of regulations are necessary to set forth the towns policy and attitude towards these housing types the town does encourage new and creative ideas when such ideas are in the best interest of the town as a whole therefore each application to zone townhousecondominium must be reviewed individually and judged on its own merits planned development in order to provide for individual review it has been decided that all townhouses condominiums cluster housing and other such concepts shall be allowed only under planned development pd zoning this appendix requires a comprehensive development plan and the development plan shall become part of the amending ordinance see article xv section 5 of this appendix therefore the following ordinance sets out the towns expectations in regard to these various requirements comprehensive site plan this is to be a graphic plan including all of the area under consideration for zoning approval and shall be submitted with the application for such zoning this plan need not be detailed but must show use areas land areas for building principal roadways parkways buffers screening and the number and type of dwelling units notes sketches photographs and drawings may be attached to the development plan to illustrate the treatment of parkways parking area buffer strips screening shrubs roadway design special subdivision lotting plans and other such ideas which cannot be satisfactorily explained otherwise such notes sketches photographs and drawings shall be used to evaluate

screening walls must be of masonry construction fences shall be offset from drives or parking so as to avoid damage by vehicles the detail development plan and the comprehensive site plan may be oneinthesame if all conditions of both are met in the event of a multiphase project it is intended that a detail development plan be submitted only on the area that is proposed for immediate development additional plans may be approved as the other phases are ready to be developed general location of zoning each application shall be judged on its appropriateness to its site and to its compatibility with existing development to other proposed development it is felt that planning it is possible to design townhousecondominium development to fit all areas of addison the master plan sets forth the proposed location of singlefamily areas these singlefamily areas are envisioned to possibly be protected from high intensity land uses and traffic volumes along major thoroughfares by

comprehensive plan by encouraging new development and redevelopment in the belt line corridor the goals of this zoning district are 1 to capitalize on the convergence of regional transit freeways and arterial roadways to create major urban and village centers in the dallasfort worth region that offer a variety of housing retail and office uses not commonly present in other areas of the metroplex 2 to provide development and land use flexibility within the framework of a formbased development zoning district 3 to provide a mix of residential retail and office uses in a pedestrianfriendly environment the intent of this zoning district is 1 to provide a comfortable and attractive environment for pedestrians which includes such things as buildings framing public space street trees lighting and awnings that will attract pedestrians 2 to construct buildings close to the sidewalk and street 3 to construct continuous building frontage along block faces except where it is desirable to provide for pedestrian and auto passthroughs to parking at midblock 4 to provide shared parking both onstreet and in the center of blocks that will benefit the entire district 5 to contribute to the definition and use of public parks and plazas 6 to design and build nonresidential buildings to accommodate a range of uses over time without the need to destroy older buildings and rebuild them for each successive use 7 to design streets and buildings that will contribute to creating a safe environment 8 to encourage redevelopment on a blockbyblock basis b implementation all development

enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use shall take place except as the zoning board of adjustment may grant as a special exception an application to extend or enlarge a building occupied by such use provided such grant does not serve to prevent the return of such property to a conforming use continuance of nonconforming use except as this appendix may otherwise require any nonconforming use may be continued in operation on the same land area and on the same floor area in a structure or structures which were occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations
