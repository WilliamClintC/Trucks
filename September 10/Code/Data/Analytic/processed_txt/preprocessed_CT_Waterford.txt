that time when original submission of an age restricted housing application is made and that time when final construction drawings are prepared for instance the location of buildings on the site may change as the master plan which is at a scale of 1 100 is refined for site plan approval to a scale of 1 40 such movement will be allowed so long as the dwelling unit remains within the buildable area

district is to preserve the existing character of a village permit infill development consistent with the existing density and character of a village and prevent villages from being nonconforming under the r20 zone a goal of the towns plan of development is to foster the preservation of the strong village identities which currently exist throughout the community thus the commission declares that it is in the public interest to insure that the distinctive character of a village should not be injuriously affected and that the scale of a village be maintained the criteria for classifying a community as a village residential district are as follows 1 a village is a stable residential area generally composed of lots smaller than the 20000 square feet minimum required in the r20 zone 2 a village functions as an entity 3 a village has an existing identifiable character which distinguishes it from surrounding development resulting from one or more factors including a common density b similar building ages sizes andor styles c geographic features including water topography and manmade barriers d street system e historic identification 4 a village was generally developed before the present zoning regulations were enacted 5 a village does not contain large tracts of undeveloped land 6a2 design objectives all development within the village density residential zone must be consistent with the following objectives 1 the pattern of development in these areas must be consistent with the present pattern of development and with the plan of development 2 the character and quality of existing village is to be maintained  structural rehabilitation is to be encouraged and the scale of the new development should be compatible with the existing buildings 3 no high intensity use or uses inconsistent with the residential character of these areas are to be permitted or be allowed to infringe on these villages 4 architectural and site design which promote aesthetic qualities while sustaining and enhancing the unique qualities of the village are required and shall be incorporated in all applications for permits the zoning official may refer an application which in hisher

determined that the protection of both surface and subsurface water quality in the town requires that stormwater runoff from roofs driveways and other impervious surfaces be treated before being discharged into streams lakes and wetlands  and whereas treatment of stormwater from impervious surfaces is achieved by one of two general methods 1 impoundments on the surface of the ground that are planted with vegetation and that allow the contaminants in stormwater to be taken up by the vegetation immobilized by dense soils and broken down by sunlight  and 2 structures located beneath the ground that collect stormwater and allow it to seep into the ground where it is purified by filtration soil before reaching subsurface groundwater levels or surface waters  and whereas the subdivision plans depict one or both of these stormwater treatment methods depending on the soil and groundwater conditions encountered on each lot  and whereas each of these stormwater treatment systems require regular maintenance in order to operate as designed  and whereas failure of these stormwater treatment systems could result in damage to the lots in the subdivision to downstream owners andor to waters that are used for domestic wells recreation and wildlife habitat  now therefore the declarant creates the following obligations for the protection and maintenance of the stormwater treatment systems on the lots in the subdivision which obligations shall run with the land and be binding on the heirs successors and assigns of the declarant 1 protection and maintenance of stormwater management systems no owner of a lot in the subdivision shall remove any subsurface stormwater treatment system or sever reroute or otherwise alter any drainage line leading to such system nor take any other action which prevents water from reaching such system and flowing as designed likewise no owner of a lot in the subdivision shall remove any surface stormwater treatment system or regrade or fill the same or sever reroute or otherwise alter any drainage line leading to such system nor take any other action which prevents water from reaching such system and flowing as designed owners of lots with surface stormwater treatment systems shall control the growth of trees or shrubs on or into any berm or other barrier which forms the impoundment no less than every two 2 years the lot owner shall be remove accumulated sediment leaves litter or other material which may have accumulated within either surface or subsurface stormwater treatment systems 2 access by town in the event of default in the event that any lot owner fails to maintain any stormwater treatment system or alters it so that it cannot operate as designed the town of waterford shall have the authority but not the obligation to enter onto such lot and perform such repairs or maintenance to the stormwater treatment system as may be required to restore it to proper operation for this purpose the town shall have the right to enter onto any lot with equipment and personnel sufficient to perform the work required and to remove any landscaping accessory structures fences walls or other obstacles which might prevent such access it is the duty of the owner to insure that a viable access to the stormwater treatment system exists on the lot for normal maintenance and repair and in the event that the town performs such work due to the lot owners failure to do so the town shall have no obligation to restore any disturbed areas other than to rough grade and seed such areas before exercising any access maintenance or repair rights under this paragraph the town shall provide written notice at least thirty 30 days before such access such notice to be by certified mail return receipt requested and setting forth the work required to be done if the lot owner performs the specified work at its own cost and expense and notifies the town of its completion the town shall not enter onto the lot unless such work has not been performed fully or correctly 3 lien to secure town work in event of default in the event that the town of waterford performs maintenance repairs or other corrective action due to any action of the lot owner or the failure of the lot owner to perform the maintenance work described in this declaration the lot owner shall reimburse the town of waterford for the cost of performing said work the town shall notify the lot owner by certified mail return receipt requested and setting forth the work performed and the cost thereof the lot owner shall pay said sum to the town within thirty 30 days of receipt the town may secure the payment of such reimbursement by a filing a lien against the lot indexed in the name of the record owner thereof 4 payment of attorneys fees any party to this declaration may enforce the provisions hereof against any other party in an action for compensatory damages injunction or such other remedy as the conditions may indicate in the event that any party to this declaration seeks to enforce its provisions the nonprevailing party shall be liable to the prevailing party for the prevailing partys reasonable costs including but not limited to attorneys fees witness fees court entry fees marshals fees and transcription costs dated at waterford connecticut this day of  20  declarant name of property owner by  duly authorized

guidance material for applicants that must develop stormwater treatment systems pursuant to the applicable town of waterford regulations these guidelines are adapted from the 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual other state stormwater manuals that have applicable material research from the university of new hampshires stormwater center and other research it is important to note that particularly for those practices adapted from the 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual some of the design elements have been changed to reflect more recent accepted best practices in stormwater quality facility design applicants are strongly encouraged to read these guidelines carefully these guidelines are designed to provide summaries of some of the most important aspects of stormwater quality facility design to ensure engineers are working within a framework that meets the town of waterfords goals importantly these guidelines do not represent a comprehensive technical document for stormwater facility design details related to sequencing of facilities in treatment trains maintenance schedules specific calculations for water quality treatment water quantity management and other technical items are not addressed in this guidance it is the responsibility of an applicant to ensure all of the necessary information called for in waterfords application checklists is provided bioretention systems bioretention systems are shallow landscaped depressions designed to manage and treat stormwater runoff bioretention systems are a variation of a surface sand filter where the sand filtration media is replaced with a planted soil bed designed to remove pollutants biological processes figure 1 bioretention system source adapted from center for watershed protection 2000 siting considerations drainage area  the maximum contributing drainage area for most surface and underground filtering practices is five acres slopes and head requirements  bioretention systems can be used on sites with slopes of six percent or less  bioretention designs require at least two feet of head difference between the inlet and outlet soils  stormwater filtering systems that return filtered runoff to the conveyance system and do not infiltrate into the ground can be used in almost any soil type  bioretention designs that rely on infiltration can be used only when the soil infiltration characteristics are appropriate water table  at least three feet of separation shall occur between the bottom of the filter and the seasonal high groundwater table design criteria the design criteria presented in this section are applicable to bioretention systems considerations for specific design variations are also included pretreatment  pretreatment shall be provided to manage at least 25 percent of the water quality volume and release it to the filter media over a 24hour period  where a sediment forebay is used for pretreatment a lengthtowidth ratio of between 1 and  is recommended design volume  bioretention facilities should provide at least 75 percent of the water quality volume in the practice including pretreatment storage above the filter bed and in the filter media voids and be designed to completely drain in 24 hours or less filter bed  bioretention systems shall consist of the following treatment components a 24 to 48 deep engineered planting soil bed depending on requirements of proposed vegetation a surface mulch layer and a 6 to 9 deep surface ponding area  engineered planting soils shall consist of usda loamy sand to sandy loam classification and meet the following graduation sand 8588% silt 812% clay 02% and organic matter in the form of leaf compost 35%  if an underdrain system is needed the system should consist of fourinch diameter or larger pvc perforated pipes reinforced to withstand the weight of the overburden schedule 40 pvc or greater cleanouts should be provided at both ends of the main collector pipe and extend to the surface of the filterbed  an impermeable liner clay geomembrane or concrete should be used for excavated bioretention facilities when infiltration below the facility could result in groundwater contamination landscapingvegetation  use native plant species to the extent practicable where nonnative species are proposed these shall be noninvasive  planting of bioretention facilities with a grass cover is not allowed winter operation  where possible the filter bed should extend below the frost line  filters that receive significant road sand should be equipped with a larger pretreatment sediment chamber or forebay infiltration practices stormwater infiltration practices are designed to capture stormwater runoff and infiltrate it into the ground over a period of days siting considerations drainage area the maximum contributing drainage area for infiltration trenches should not exceed two acres the maximum contributing drainage area for infiltration basins should not exceed ten acres soils underlying soils should have a minimum infiltration rate of 05 inches per hour as initially determined from nrcs soil textural classifications and subsequently confirmed by a field investigation acceptable to the review authority slopes infiltration basins are not recommended in areas with natural slopes greater than 15 percent and should be located at least 50 feet from slopes greater than 15 percent since steep slopes can cause water leakage in the lower portions of the basin and may reduce infiltration rates due to lateral water movement water table the bottom of the infiltration facility should be located at least three feet above the seasonal high water table or bedrock as documented by onsite soil testing miscellaneous infiltration practices should not be placed over fill materials and except where recommended by local or state health departments or by the department of energy and environmental protection should be located at least 75 feet away from  drinking water supply wells

infiltrate into the soil or conveying it to another stormwater practice siting considerations drainage area  permeable pavements should only be used to manage precipitation that falls directly on the permeable pavement area to protect the surface from clogging contributing drainage areas should be kept to a minimum ie runoff from upgradient impermeable or permeable surfaces should be minimal area of application  permeable paving surfaces are best used in low traffic areas such as overflow parking residential driveways sidewalks plazas and courtyard areas areas with high amounts of sediment particles and high traffic volumes may cause system failures should not construct adjacent to areas subject to significant wind erosion  to protect groundwater from possible contamination runoff from land uses or activities that may generate high levels of pollution andor hazards materials must not be directed to permeable pavement unless designed as a detention facility with an impermeable liner

25 setback does not apply where basement or slab is at or above the surface elevation of the permeable pavement design criteria there are two major types of permeable paving 1 porous asphalt and pervious concrete although they appear to be the same as traditional asphalt or concrete pavement they have 10%25% void space and are constructed over a base course that doubles as a reservoir for the stormwater before it infiltrates into the subsoil or is directed to a downstream facility a sample crosssection is provided for illustration purposes only in figure 1 figure 1 example crosssection of porous asphalt unhsc 2009 2 pavers two alternative paver configurations will be acceptable to the approving agency as water quality bmps these are as follows a permeable solid blocks or reinforced turf this type of permeable paving surface includes permeable solid blocks where the blocks have a minimum void ratio of 15% and contain opencell grids filled with washed aggregate for paving blocks or sandy soil and planted with turf for reinforced turf applications b solid blocks with opencell joints this type of paver surface includes interlocking impermeable solid blocks or open grid cells that contain permeable void areas between the impermeable blocks a permeable pavement system can fall under one of two categories an infiltration facility or a detention facility the infiltration restrictions noted in this section do not apply to detention facilities  use permeable paving only on gentle slopes less than 5%  the bottom of infiltrating permeable pavement practices must be located in the soil profile where a tmdl goal requires maximum treatment of runoff the bottom shall be within the uppermost soil horizons a or b or another stormwater management practice is required

confirmed by field geotechnical tests  for infiltrating permeable paving practices underlying soils shall also have a clay content of less than 20% and a silt content of less than 60%  the bottom of an infiltrating permeable pavement practice cannot be located in fill with the exception for strictly residential land uses for which the bottom may be located in up to two feet of fill consisting of material suitable for longterm infiltration  permeable paving practices should be designed with an impermeable liner when used where subsurface contamination is present from prior land use due to the increased threat of pollutant migration associated with increased hydraulic loading from infiltration systems unless contaminated soil is removed and the site is remediated  all permeable pavement systems shall be designed to fully dewater the entire water quality volume within 24 hours after the storm event  install signage identifying areas with pervious pavement and prohibiting stockpiling of snow mulch soil or any other like materials stormwater wetlands stormwater wetlands are constructed wetlands that incorporate marsh areas and permanent pools to provide enhanced treatment and attenuation of stormwater flows stormwater wetlands differ from stormwater ponds in that wetland vegetation is a major element of the overall treatment mechanism as opposed to a supplementary component stormwater wetlands are different from gravel wetlands in that storage of water is generally on the surface with stormwater wetlands and includes various levels of temporary ponding depending on design gravel wetlands rely primarily on subsurface gravel media to store and convey stormwater horizontally shallow wetlands most shallow wetland systems also referred to as shallow marsh wetlands consist of aquatic vegetation with a permanent pool ranging from 6 to 18 inches during normal conditions shallow wetlands are designed such that flow wetlands is conveyed uniformly across the treatment area figure 1 depicts a typical schematic design of a shallow wetland extended detention shallow wetlands extended detention shallow wetlands provide a greater degree of downstream channel protection as they are designed with more vertical storage capacity the additional vertical storage volume also provides extra runoff detention above the normal pool elevations water levels in the extended detention shallow wetland may increase by as much as three feet after a storm event and return gradually to prestorm elevations within 24 hours of the storm event figure 2 depicts a typical schematic design of an extended detention shallow wetland pondwetland systems multiple cell systems such as pondwetland systems utilize at least one pond component in conjunction with a shallow marsh component the first cell is typically a wet pond which provides pretreatment of the runoff by removing particulate pollutants the wet pond is also used to reduce the velocity of the runoff entering the system the shallow marsh then polishes the runoff particularly for soluble pollutants prior to discharge figure 3 depicts a typical schematic of a pondwetland system siting considerations drainage area  a typical minimum drainage area is 25 acres unless the system intercepts groundwater or is lined to maintain adequate minimum water levels  stormwater wetland surface area must be minimum of 15% of contributing drainage area groundwater and soils  unlined wetland basins must 1 intersect the groundwater table in order to maintain the desired permanent pool volume

pool of water and are constructed to provide both treatment and attenuation of stormwater flows the design of wet extended detention ponds is focused on attenuating peak runoff flows as a result more storage volume is committed to managing peak flows as opposed to maximizing the wet pool depth the configuration of the outfall structure provides additional storage volume above the level of the permanent pool figure 1 siting considerations drainage area  typical minimum drainage area is 25 acres may be varied where minimum depth of water will be maintained groundwater  unlined basins must

oxygen levels during late summer  baseflow can be provided by groundwater infiltrating into either the basin or the collection system above the pond site slopes  steep onsite slopes may result in the need for a large embankment to be constructed to provide the desired storage volume which could require a dam construction permit from the connecticut deep receiving waters  the sensitivity of
