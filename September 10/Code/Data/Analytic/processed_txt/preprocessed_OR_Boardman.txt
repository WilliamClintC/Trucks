subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near

purpose the intent of this to manage vehicle access to development connected street system while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety roadway capacity and efficiency access shall be managed to maintain adequate performance standards and to maintain the functional classification of roadways as required by the citys comprehensive plan major roadways including highways arterials and collectors serve as the primary system for moving people and goods access management is a primary concern on these roads local streets and alleys provide access to individual properties if vehicular access and circulation are not properly designed these roadways will be unable to accommodate the needs of development and serve their transportation function this to balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of the citizens of the city and the state of oregon to safe and efficient travel it also requires developments to construct planned streets arterials and collectors and to extend local streets to achieve this policy intent state and local roadways have been categorized in the comprehensive plan by function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance and function see  regulations have been applied to these roadways for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents personal injury and property damage attributable to access systems and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network this will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures these regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land protect community character and conserve natural resources by promoting welldesigned road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned subdivision of land b applicability this ordinance shall apply to all public streets within the city and to all properties that abut these streets city of

city of boardman development city of boardman october 2002 vehicle and bicycle parking purpose   applicability   automobile parking standards   bicycle parking standards  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide basic and flexible standards for development of vehicle and bicycle parking the design of parking areas is critically important to the viability of some commercial areas pedestrian and driver safety the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets and community image and livability historically some communities have required more parking than is necessary for some land uses paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use because vehicle parking facilities can occupy large amounts of land they must be planned and designed carefully to use the land efficiently while maintaining the visual character of the community this chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs by providing a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements ie minimum and performancebased standards this chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community  applicability all developments subject to site design review defined in  including development of parking facilities shall comply with the provisions of this parking standards the minimum number of required offstreet vehicle parking spaces ie parking that is located in parking lots and garages and not in the street rightofway shall be determined based on the standards in a there is no minimum number of offstreet parking spaces required in the city center sub

the method of grading to provide drainage which meets the intent of the stormwater management strategy and wind erosion abatement requirements of the city will require significant cooperation between city staff and the developer minimal grading and surface disturbance from existing topography is generally the best strategic approach to stormwater management and wind erosion concerns within the city of boardman however to accommodate other provisions within the zoning and development codes to allow for placement of utility and transportation infrastructure and to allow for effective stormwater management grading and drainage must be assessed and a plan to manage stormwater and wind erosion shall be developed this plan shall be developed to negate or minimize impacts from the development during construction and long term operation and occupancy of the development b public infrastructure and rightsofway grading plans for public and utility infrastructure shall include topographical information of existing property and a planned topographical profile at the completion of the development the plan shall address how the provisions of section  will be included in the final topographical profile as these provisions may require altering existing topography to meet the criteria creating the maximum drainage areas of 3500 square feet impervious surface may require

existing uses or development that do not comply with the  this code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation the citys varied geography and complexities of land development require flexibility provides that flexibility while maintaining the purposes and intent of the variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other provisions of the standards for nonconforming uses and development are intended to provide some relief from code requirements for older developments that do not comply city of boardman development city of boardman october 2002 variances purpose   class a variance   class b variance   class c variance   variance application and appeals  purpose the purpose of this to provide flexibility to development standards in recognition of the complexity and wide variation of site development opportunities and constraints the variance procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met because some variances are granted using clear and objective standards they can be granted by means of a type i procedure other variances as identified below require a type ii or iii procedure because they involve discretionary decisionmaking  class a variances a class a variances the following variances are reviewed using a type i procedure as governed by using the approval criteria in below 1 front yard setbacks up to a 10 percent change to the front yard setback standard in the base land use district 2 interior setbacks up to a 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side and rear yard setbacks required in the base land use district 3 lot coverage up to 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage permitted in the base land use district  4 landscape area up to 10 percent reduction in required landscape area overall area or interior parking lot landscape area b class a variance approval criteria a class a variance shall be granted if the applicant demonstrates compliance with all of the following criteria 1 the variance requested is required due to the lot configuration or other conditions of the site  2 the variance does not result in the removal of trees or it is proposed in order to preserve trees if trees are present in the development area  3 the variance will not result in violations of or other design standards city of boardman development city of boardman october 2002  class b variances due to their discretionary nature the following types of variances shall be reviewed using a type ii procedure in accordance with  a variance to vehicular access and circulation standards  where vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to within a particular parcel shared access with an adjoining property shall be considered if shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible the city may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding the following 1 there is not adequate physical space for shared access or the owners of abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement  2 there are no other alternative access points on the street in question or from another street  3 the access separation requirements cannot be met  4 the request is the minimum adjustment required to provide adequate access  5 the approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe access  and 6 the visual clearance requirements of will be met b variance to street tree requirements  the city may approve or approve with conditions a request for a variance to the street tree requirements in after finding the following 1 installation of the tree would interfere with existing utility lines  or 2 the tree would cause visual clearance problems  or 3 there is not adequate space in which to plant a street tree  and 4 replacement landscaping is provided elsewhere on the site eg parking lot area trees c variance to maximum or minimum yard setbacks to reduce tree removal or impacts to wetlands chapters 2 and 32 the city may grant a variance to the applicable setback requirements of this the purpose of preserving a tree or trees on the site of proposed development or avoiding wetland impacts the modification shall not be more than is necessary for the preservation of trees on the site d variances to transportation improvement requirements  the city may approve approve with conditions or deny a variance to the transportation improvement standards of based on the criteria for granting variances provided in b when a variance request cannot be supported by the provisions of that then the request shall be reviewed as a class c variance  class c variances due to their discretionary nature and review of special circumstances the variances in this subsection require a type iii process as described in c city of boardman development city of boardman october 2002  class c variances continued a purpose the purpose of this section is to provide standards for variances which exceed the class a and class b variance criteria in  class c variances may be granted if the applicant shows that owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific property the literal application of the standards of the applicable land use district would create a hardship to development which is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography sensitive lands  or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity eg the same land use district  except that no variances to permitted uses or prohibited uses shall be granted b applicability 1 the variance standards are intended to apply to individual platted and recorded lots only 2 an applicant who proposes to vary a specification standard for lots not yet created land division process may not utilize the class c variance procedure 3 a variance shall not be approved which would vary the permitted uses or prohibited uses of a land use district  4 variance to parking standards  a the city may approve variances to the minimum or maximum standards for offstreet parking in finding all of the following 1 the individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity  2 the need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met parking with adjacent or nearby uses  and 3 all other parking design and building orientation standards are met in conformance with the standards in b the city may approve a reduction of required bicycle parking per if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking c the city may allow a reduction in the amount of vehicle stacking area required for driveif such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the size and location of the development limited services available and other pertinent factors c approvals process and criteria 1 class c variances shall be processed using a type iii procedure as governed by using the approval criteria in subsection 2 below in addition to the application requirements contained in the applicant shall provide a written narrative or letter describing hisher reasoning for the variance why it is required alternatives considered and compliance with the criteria in subsection 2 2 the

to the purposes of this to any other applicable policies and standards and to other properties in the same land use district or vicinity  city of boardman development city of boardman october 2002  class c variances continued b a hardship to development exists which is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography sensitive lands or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity eg the same land use district  c the use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and city standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting reasonable economic use of the land  d existing physical and natural systems such as but not limited to traffic drainage natural resources and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject   e the hardship is not selfimposed  and f
