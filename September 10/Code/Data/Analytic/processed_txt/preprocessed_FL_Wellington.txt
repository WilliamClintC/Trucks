structures and lots that do not conform to the provisions of this any amendments thereto and where possible bring the use into conformance with this   general it is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to continue but not to allow nonconformities to be enlarged or expanded except under the limited circumstances established in this article the provisions of this article

of nonconforming uses  major and minor table 171 shall govern whether a nonconforming uses is major or minor except that any use in a location nonconforming to the comprehensive plan future land use element shall be deemed a major nonconforming use a nonconforming use is designated as major when it is established in a zoning district where the use is prohibited and the location is so significantly inappropriate that its location creates or threatens to create incompatibilities potentially injurious to the public welfare therefore strict limits are set forth in this section for the expansion and continuation of major nonconforming uses a minor nonconforming use is prohibited in the district in which it is located or is inconsistent with the physical or permit requirements of this nonconforming uses do not create or threaten to create incompatibilities injurious to the public welfare therefore provisions which allow limited expansion of minor nonconforming uses are established a nonconforming use shall either be a major nonconforming use or minor nonconforming use as identified in table 171 major nonconforming use a normal maintenance or repair normal

fixtures wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding twenty 20 percent of the current assessed value of the structure b enlargement or expansion a major nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied except a major nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of a structure that was manifestly designed and approved for such use prior to the date the use became nonconformity c relocation a structure containing a major nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located unless the relocation of the structure containing the major nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity d change in use a major nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use unless any new or additional use conforms to the provisions of this the zoning district in which the use is located a major nonconforming use physically superseded by a permitted use shall not be reestablished e discontinuance or abandonment if a major nonconforming use is discontinued abandoned or becomes an accessory use for a period of more than six 6 consecutive months or for eighteen 18 months during any three 3 consecutive years then such use may not be reestablished or resumed and any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions specified by this government action can be documented as a reason for discontinuance or abandonment the time of delay by government shall not be calculated for the purpose of this section minor nonconforming use a normal maintenance or repair normal maintenance or

and intent the application of flexible land use regulations to the development of land is often difficult or impossible within traditional zoning district standards in order to permit the use of more flexible land use regulations and to facilitate use of the most advantageous techniques of land development it is often necessary to establish a planned development district designation in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this the comprehensive plan the objective of a planned development district is to encourage ingenuity imagination and design efforts on the part of builders architects site planners and developers to produce development that is in keeping with overall land use intensity and open space objectives of this the comprehensive plan while departing from the strict application of the dimensional standards of traditional districts planned development districts are intended to allow design flexibility and provide performance standards that 1 ensure that future growth and development occurs in accordance with the comprehensive plan  2 minimize adverse impacts of development on the environment by preserving native vegetation wetlands and protected animal species to the greatest extent possible  3 increase and promote the use of mass transit bicycle routes and other nonvehicular modes of transportation  4 result in a desirable environment with more amenities than would be possible strict application of the minimum standards of a standard zoning district  5 provide for an efficient use of land and public resources resulting in colocation of harmonious uses to share facilities and services and a logical network of utilities and streets thereby lowering development costs  6 foster the safe efficient and economic use of land transportation public facilities and services  7 encourage concentrated land use patterns which decrease the length of automobile travel allow trip consolidation and encourage pedestrian circulation between land uses  8 enhance the appearance of the land of natural features the provision of underground utilities where possible and the provision of recreation areas and open space in excess of existing standards  9 avoid the inappropriate development of lands and provide for adequate drainage and reduction of flood damage  10 ensure a more rational and compatible relationship between residential and nonresidential uses for the mutual benefit of all  11 protect existing residential and commercial neighborhoods from harmful encroachment by intrusive or disruptive development  12 provide an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding areas  and 13 provide for innovations in land development especially for affordable housing and infill development  b

buffering purpose and intent the purpose and intent of this section is to promote the health safety and welfare of existing and future residents of the village of wellington by establishing minimum standards for the installation and continued maintenance of landscaping and buffers within the village of wellington the specific objectives of the section are as follows a aesthetics to improve the aesthetic appearance of development landscaping that helps to harmonize and enhance the natural and built environment  b environmental quality to improve environmental quality by maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge  reducing and reversing air noise heat and chemical pollution biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation  promoting energy conservation creation of shade  reducing heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas filtering capacity of trees and other vegetation  reducing the temperature of the microclimate process of evapotranspiration  and encouraging the use of limited fresh water resources use of native and drought resistant plants  c water conservation to promote water conservation by encouraging xeriscaping in appropriate areas such as medians and utilization of native and drought tolerant landscape material  encouraging the utilization of water conserving irrigation practices  requiring adherence to sound landscape installation standards and maintenance procedures that promote water conservation  ecological placement of landscape material  and utilization of natural areas and vegetation d preservation of native plants and vegetation to encourage the preservation and planting of native vegetation and plants  e efficiency in land development to promote efficiency in the development of limited land resources by improving the compatibility of otherwise incompatible land uses in close proximity particularly residential development that is adjacent to more intensive commercial and industrial development use of landscaped buffers  f land values to maintain and increase the value of land by requiring minimum landscaping which when installed and maintained properly becomes a capital asset  g human values to provide physical and psychological benefits to persons by reducing noise and glare and by softening the harsher visual aspects of urban development  h removal of prohibited plant species to encourage the initial eradication and control the ongoing removal of prohibited plant species which have become nuisances because of their tendency to disrupt or destroy native ecosystems  and i improved design to encourage innovative and costeffective approaches to the design installation and maintenance of landscaping particularly those that promote energy water conservation and incorporate areas of native vegetation landscape design principles and concepts the standards established in this section are to be considered the minimum requirements for landscape design it is the intent of this section to encourage creativity in landscape design while providing general direction and criteria for the evaluation of landscape plans planting plans and alternative landscape plans the following design principles shall be used in evaluating whether standard landscape plans planting plans and alternative landscape plans conform to the requirements of this section a composition the quality of a landscape design is as dependent on the composition of its elements as on the quantity and selection of plant materials landscape materials should be arranged in a manner as to provide the following qualities and characteristics 1 texture landscape designs should seek to provide a textured appearance use of a variety of plant material rather than a single species contrasting large leaf textures with medium and small leaf textures and a variety of plant heights at maturity spacing of key landscaping components such as trees and shrubs is an important element of texture and should be consistent with the overall design approach of the landscape plan formal landscape designs benefit from a uniform spacing of plants whereas varied spacing and clustering of trees is more compatible with a naturalistic design 2 color landscape designs should include a variety of plants to provide contrasting color to other plants in the design designs are encouraged to include flowering plants and especially a mix of plants that display colorful flowers throughout the year 3 form landscape designs should consider the complete threedimensional form of the landscape not simply the form of individual elements the interrelationship of all landscape components should be considered so that the final landscaping works together to present a coherent whole trees shrubs and hedges especially those used for screening and buffering should display fullness at maturity that is typical of the species b buffering and screening the placement of natural landscape materials trees shrubs and hedges is the preferred method for buffering differing land uses for providing a transition between adjacent properties and to screen the view of any parking or storage area refuse collection utility enclosures or service area visible from a public street alley or pedestrian area plants may be used in concert with fences andor berms to achieve the desired screen or buffering effect landscape material should be mature enough at the time of planting to provide an effective buffer or screen and should be planted in an appropriate location to allow for desired growth within a reasonable period of time when used to screen an activity area such as a parking lot landscaping should not obstruct the visibility of motorists or pedestrians and shall not interfere with public safety c responsive to local context and character landscape designs should build on the sites and the areas unique physical characteristics conserving and complementing existing natural features naturalistic design elements such as irregular plant spacing undulating contours and mixed proportions of plant species should be used to ensure new landscaping blends and contribute to the quality of the surrounding area selection and spacing of plant material should be reflective of the neighborhood district or area character if a local plant is identified within an area and is consistent with the requirements of this section that plant should be incorporated in landscape designs d use of native and drought resistant plants wherever feasible and environmentally beneficial landscape designs should feature native andor related plant species especially in areas adjacent to existing native vegetation to take advantage of the unique natural character and diversity of the region and the adaptability of native plants to local environmental conditions where feasible the reestablishment of native habitats should be incorporated into the landscape design in the same manner landscape designs are encouraged to utilize drought tolerant plant materials to the maximum extent feasible the use of drought tolerant plants should enrich the existing landscape character conserve water and energy and provide as pleasant and varied a visual appearance as plants that require more water further trees and shrubs shall be planted in the energy conservation zone where feasible in order to reduce energy consumption by shading buildings and shall be used to reduce heat island effects by shading paved surfaces e natural landscape landscape designs should incorporate and complement existing natural landscapes and existing specimen trees and native vegetation including canopy understory and ground cover particular care should be given to preserve intact natural ecosystems where previous landscaping has dramatically altered natural landscapes new designs should seek to reestablish natural landscape patterns and plantings f continuity and connection landscaping should be designed in a manner consistent with the adjacent and surrounding landscape provided that the surrounding and planned landscaping is also consistent with the other design principles plant materials should blend well with adjacent properties particularly where property edges meet to create a seamless and natural landscape exceptions should be made when seeking to create a transition between uses districts and tiers g enhancing architecture landscape design should be compatible with and enhance architectural character and features and help relate structure design to the site major landscape elements should be designed to complement architectural elevations and rooflines texture density and form on both vertical and horizontal planes landscaping should be in scale with adjacent buildings and be of appropriate size at maturity to accomplish intended goals foundation planting and window boxes should be designed to be compatible with a buildings architectural character and are strongly encouraged to incorporate artistic elements h energy conservation and sustainable design  attention should be given to locating landscape elements in a manner that provides energy conservation benefits shade trees planted in the energy conservation zone for example can provide daytime shading for buildings reducing energy needed for interior air conditioning landscape design should also consider natural drainage features and the use of pervious surfaces and areas to minimize runoff i pedestrian importance in pedestrianoriented development types landscape designs should give special attention to the needs of pedestrians where landscaping is provided on both sides of a sidewalk pedestrians should have the experience of walking landscape that is separated by a

project and are not newly generated trips credit against the trip generation of the proposed project may be taken for these trips up to the percentage shown in the countys impact fee the ite manual when approved by the village engineer the study must detail 1 all traffic generated from the project and 2 the number of passby trips subtracted from the traffic generated by the project during the buildout period of the project uses other than those listed in countys impact fee any percentage credit proposed to be taken in excess of that shown in countys impact fee be justified based on accepted traffic engineering principles to the satisfaction of the village engineer as part of the required traffic study based upon the peculiar characteristics and location of the proposed project factors which should be considered in determining a different passby rate include type and size of land use location with respect to service population location with respect to competing uses location with respect to the surrounding wellington roadway system and existing and projected traffic volumes in no case shall the number of passby trips exceed twentyfive 25 percent of existing traffic plus

study shall forecast the change in traffic volumes based on background traffic within the proposed projects radius of development influence during the buildout period of the proposed project the historical growth rate tables shall be based on historical daily traffic volumes however the growth rates shall be applied on a peak season peakhours directional basis the effect of committed projects shall be considered in projecting the increase or decrease in traffic volumes so as to ensure that there is no double counting or omission in background traffic in using the historical growth tables engineering judgment shall be used to take into account special circumstances such as the opening of a parallel road or a high traffic generation that may distort the growth trend for projects with a lengthy buildout time five 5 years or more an area wide growth rate using a number of locations in the tables may be appropriate no growth rate less than zero 0 percent may be used without approval of the village engineer when the growth rate is a negative c tps database using the countys tps database all traffic from the unbuilt portion of projects which have received a concurrency reservation prior to the county engineers approval of the proposed projects traffic study which will add significant trips to any link within the area surrounding the proposed projects during the buildout period
