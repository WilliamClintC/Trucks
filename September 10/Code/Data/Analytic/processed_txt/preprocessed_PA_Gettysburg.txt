applicantowner b the denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable economic hardship to the owner based on the following criteria  11110 foreword  11110 fwd225  the applicantowner has demonstrated that the condition of the building constitutes a serious and immediate threat to the safety of the public or occupants that cannot be eliminated without repairs required to meet specified

economic benefit from the preservation of the building in making a claim of unreasonable economic hardship in  11110 all potential uses for the building shall be thoroughly examined and addressed in

affidavit to the board all the information set in  11110 an assertion that the ownerapplicant can achieve a greater economic return by demolishing the building or that the owner lacks adequate funds

have substantial public benefit which outweighs the loss of the building and the proposed project must occur at that specific site d the demolition will result in a new building that will be an improvement to the character of the historic district considering the architectural design proposed for the new building e the building proposed for demolition does not contribute to the character of the historic district 3 when the board deems a proposed demolition undesirable it may recommend that the demolition be postponed for a period not to exceed nine months for the consideration of the

conditions necessary for the boards recommendation to the borough council for the approval of a certificate of appropriateness 2 the board may require that an applicantowner furnish additional information relevant to its determination of unreasonable economic hardship 3 should the board determine that the present economic return of the applicantowner is not reasonable it must consider whether there are other uses currently allowed that would provide a reasonable economic return and whether such a return could be obtained in the property for rehabilitation purposes the board may choose to recommend that special local state or federal economic and tax incentives be developed to assist the applicantowner of the property in maintaining it and obtaining a suitable economic return or achieving a reasonable beneficial use 4 the board may seek the assistance of appropriate local statewide or national preservation organizations andor economic development agencies for solutions or funding which may relieve the economic hardship of the applicant owner if the board chooses to explore such options the board may delay its recommendation for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition based on economic hardship for a period of up to 90 days in addition to any other applicable time periods for approval of the project 5 should the applicantowner satisfy

objectives  27101 title 52008 this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the gettysburg borough zoning   27102 purpose 52008 the purpose of the chapter is  27103 statement of community development objectives 52008 community development objectives are as follows a to promote protect and facilitate the public health safety and general welfare coordinated and practical community development proper density of population emergency management preparedness and operations the provision of adequate light and air access to incident solar energy police protection vehicle parking and loading space transportation water sewerage schools recreational facilities public grounds the provision of a safe reliable and adequate water supply for domestic commercial or industrial use and other public requirements  as well as the preservation of the natural scenic and historic values in the environment and preservation of wetlands and floodplains b to prevent the overcrowding of land blight danger and congestion in travel and transportation and loss of health life or property from fire flood panic or other dangers c to provide for the use of land for residential housing of various dwelling types encompassing all basic forms of housing including singlefamily and twofamily dwellings and a reasonable range of multifamily dwellings in various arrangements d to accommodate reasonable overall community growth including population and employment growth and opportunities for development of a variety of residential dwelling types and nonresidential uses a to have a better quality of life for all of those living working shopping learning etc within the community b to maintain a financially viable community broadly speaking if we can maintain an attractive place to live and an attractive place to do business the community will prosper the presence of the gettysburg college the gettysburg seminary and the gettysburg national park with its related visitor activities have the potential of bringing into the community enough new money to maintain a healthy economy and tax base it therefore follows that the borough the college the seminary and the national park service should cooperate closely to maintain a  27101 foreword  27103 fwd729 healthy relationship this spirit of cooperation must also be extended to cumberland township and straban township because many of the actions necessary to improve the quality of life within the borough must necessarily involve the entire area surrounding the borough in fact many of the actions that need to be taken are virtually impossible without the cooperation of the entire area c to protect our natural resources it has been determined that our most important natural resources are the physical aspects of the land that is the overall appearance of the area and our historical heritage  the gettysburg address president eisenhowers home and other historical events and places d to protect natural and historic resources from exploitation and desecration with the proper planning these resources can be protected e to develop in the proper areas and regulate development so that it does not adversely impact our natural and historic resources f to encourage the complete cooperation of the borough the townships and the national park service the first and most important is the development of an areawide sewage treatment facility second is an areawide water treatment and distribution facility  this would include the development of water resources there are a number of actions that must take place to revitalize the downtown area this area must provide a unique shopping experience for the resident as well as the visitor in order to successfully compete with present and future shopping centers a circumferential highway system a shuttle bus service for visitors firstclass parking facilities and reduced traffic congestion will improve the attractiveness of the borough onstreet parking could be eliminated  this would enhance the appearance of the shopping area the offstreet parking must be first class paved illuminated and landscaped with walkways to the main streets the rear of all buildings in the present shopping area would have to be upgraded and be inviting to the shopper g to protect and enhance this historic area significant actions that have been already taken  the enactment of the borough historic district  and the borough sign  efforts should be made to install authentic period ornamental lighting plant trees and develop landscaped miniparks entrances should be made more attractive unsightly objects such as tv antennas and unnecessary traffic signs should be eliminated in order to maintain the vitality of the downtown area the county offices should be retained in the downtown area h to develop affordableattainable housing housing for agequalified persons and marketrate housing this could give new life to certain areas and would stimulate upgrading of other substandard housing  27103 gettysburg code  27103 fwd730  27104 miscellaneous legal provisions 52008 i to stimulate commercial development within the borough a sufficient amount of commercial development must take place in order to raise the tax base and provide the necessary income to properly operate the borough with historic development and reasonable zoning certain commercial interests will want to become part of the community zoning of course is of prime importance if the community can be properly zoned everything can be kept in its proper place we are indeed fortunate that up to this point in time the community has developed in a fairly reasonable and acceptable manner there are indications that this may not continue indefinitely it is therefore essential that we plan for the future if we can plan properly for a quality environment many of the other qualities of good living will follow j to help achieve the specific goals listed in the gettysburg borough comprehensive plan
