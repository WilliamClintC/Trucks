planning commission assembly review fevaluation and approval or denial of conditional use applications for island properties it is the intent of this code to recognize the unique qualities of islands within sitka sound and the substantial differences that exist between individual islands and island groups specific conditional uses may be fully appropriate in certain circumstances and on specific parcels uses that are well designed andor have low impact may enhance surrounding properties and may not create any impacts examples may include structures that are built on larger lots away from exterior property lines uses that are placed in the middle of parcels uses that do not materially increase activity on easements or moorage uses where there is a significant vegetative or terrain buffer between properties and islands that are separated by substantial distances in these cases conditional use requests can and should be handled expeditiously conditional uses on other properties may be totally inappropriate due to the concerns such as impacts on adjacent properties lack of vegetative or distance buffers noise generation unmitigated increased usage of access easements

bgeneration of noise cnumbers of guests and employees dvisibility from adjacent uses including waterborne traffic euse of common access easements favailability of necessary moorage guse of natural or
