requirements of this be maintained by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period of land disturbance and land development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance and to prevent nuisance conditions sec 1527 control of erosion and pollutants during land disturbance and development a applicability this to the following sites of land development or land disturbing activities 1 those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction of houses or commercial industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys 2 those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of houses or commercial industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys 3 those involving grading removal of protective ground cover or vegetation excavation land filling or other land disturbing activity affecting a surface area of four thousand 4000 square feet or more 4 those involving excavation or filling or a combination of excavation and filling affecting four hundred 400 cubic yards or more of dirt sand or other excavation or fill material 5 those involving street highway road or bridge construction enlargement relocation or reconstruction 6 those involving the laying repairing replacing or enlarging of an underground pipe or facility for a distance of three hundred 300 feet or more 574 note the above applicability criteria are specifically stated in 1983 wisconsin act 416 for inclusion in this companies responsible for energy repair work should enter into a memorandum of agreement with the building inspector clearly stating their responsibilities if their activities may be included under any of the above applicability criteria b erosion and other pollutant control requirements the following requirements shall be met on all sites described in a 1 site dewatering water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins grit chambers sand filters upslope chambers hydrocyclones swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of one hundred 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate if the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than one hundred 100 microns during dewatering operations then no control is needed before discharge except as determined by the building inspector water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels note there are several ways to meet this particle size performance objective depending on the pumping rate as an example if the pumping rate is very low 1 galmin then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe about 8 in diameter for 1 galmin several feet long would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of one hundred 100 micron and larger particles as the pumping rate increases then the device must be enlarged at a moderate 100 galmin pumping rate a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe or concrete pipe section or other small tank about 412 feet across for a 100 galmin pumping rate several feet tall would be adequate with these pipe sections or small tanks inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence with very large pumping rates 10000 galmin sediment basins about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10000 galmin at least three 3 feet in depth with a simple but adequately sized pipe outlet would be needed more sophisticated control devices such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above but they would not be required 2 waste and material disposal all waste and unused building materials including garbage debris cleaning wastes wastewater toxic materials or hazardous materials shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system 3 tracking each site shall have graveled roads access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways 4 drain inlet protection all storm drain

to land development or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site a channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing site shall be diverted around disturbed areas if practical otherwise the channel shall be protected as described below in b5c3 sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than ten thousand 10000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 05 feet sec across the disturbed area for the set of one 1 year design storms diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels note soil and conservation service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of channels should be followed b all activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time c runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either of the following 1 all disturbed ground left inactive for seven 7 or more days shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding only available prior to september l5th or by mulching or covering or other equivalent

storms having durations from 05 to 24 hours the basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water 3 for sites with less than ten 10 acres disturbed at one time filter fences straw bales or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site if a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes site filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel d any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten 10 cubic yards of material should not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than twentyfive 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel if remaining for more than seven 7 days they shall be stabilized by mulching vegetative cover tarps or other means erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than seven 7 days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile instreet utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than twentyfive 25 feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative
