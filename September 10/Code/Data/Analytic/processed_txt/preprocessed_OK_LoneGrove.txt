areas of the city of lone grove are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage eff 419 2010 1413 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dminimize prolonged business interruptions  eminimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  fhelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and gensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area eff 4192010 1414 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
