welfare in the vicinity no variance can be considered unless the planning and zoning commission finds a that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the configuration or other factor of the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of hisher land  b that the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the legal property rights of its owner  c that the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health safety or welfare or injurious to the legal rights other property

financial hardship to the subdivider standing alone shall not constitute undue hardship e the city commission shall have the ultimate power to grant or reject variances upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission  fasttrack approval of certificates the city commission finds that the additional requirements which it has imposed on property owners developers builders and utilities operating within its corporate boundaries and within its extraterritorial jurisdiction to conform their actions to the requirements of its comprehensive development plans impose a duty on the city to respond in a judicious and efficient manner to requests made under the regulations therefore in order that property owners developers builders and utilities may satisfy the requirements of   and  of the local government the requirements of these regulations without undue delay the city commission hereby orders as follows a any owner or possessor of land within the citys corporate boundaries or its extraterritorial jurisdiction as hereinafter defined may request that the city issue a certification that the land has been properly platted and subdivided in conformance with the citys platting and subdivision regulations b upon a written request as provided in subsection a which includes the legal description of the land the director of planning or his designee shall determine within no later than 5 days from the date of receipt of a written application whether the land has been previously properly platted and subdivided as required by the citys subdivision regulations he shall so certify if the records and minutes of the city commission so indicate  appeal in the event the plat of a subdivision has been disapproved by the planning and zoning commission the subdivider may petition the city commission for a hearing upon said rejection by filing a formal request for the    375418 hearing with the city secretary after a public hearing and the city commission upon 23 vote of it entire membership may approve the subdivision or take other action consistent with the provisions of this resolution the hearing shall be set within twentyone 21 days after the filing of a request for the hearing article iv fire flow regulation commentary in texas a city may or may not be the exclusive provider of water or sewer services within its corporate boundaries water supply corporations and sewer corporations have vast areas within their certificates of convenience and necessity over which they have the exclusive right to provide these services these areas include in particular certain areas within the citys corporate boundaries the city does not have the authority to regulate water rates of the military highway water supply corporation or the north alamo water supply corporation which are retail public utilities along with the city however under the texas water the texas natural resources conservation commission has no power or jurisdiction over a municipality that regulates land and supervises water and sewer utilities within its corporate boundaries except as provided by this does this mean it is the citys view that subsection f expressly provides no intention to withdraw the citys jurisdiction over land regulation it would appear that land regulation continues within the exclusive power of the city and to that extent it will have indirect power to set up reasonable standards over land regulation including the size and capacity of water and sewer lines by adopting regulations governing land development therefore while the city may not control the rate authority for a water supply corporation it can prevent development of land which does not comply with local subdivision regulations definitions the following definitions are applicable to this regulation only facilities all the plant and equipment of a utility including all tangible and intangible real and personal property without limitation and any and all means and instrumentalities in any manner owned operated leased licensed used controlled furnished or supplied for by or in connection with the business of any utility new customer any person or entity who seeks water services at a location within the citys limits from a utility and has not previously had water services from that utility at that location provided however that a person or entity who seeks water services from a location previously served with water services by a utility shall not be deemed a new customer for purposes of this regulation if the current character or nature of the use of the location has not materially changed from the previous use when the location received water services order the whole or a part of the final disposition whether affirmative negative injunctive or declaratory in form of the regulatory authority in a matter other than rulemaking but including issuance of certificates of convenience and necessity and rate setting proceeding any hearing investigation inquiry or other factfinding or decisionmaking procedure under this regulation service any act done rendered or performed anything furnished or supplied and any facility used

requirements of the utilitys facilities as compared with the texas department of healths minimum capacity requirements for a public drinking water system if the utility purchases any supply or service from another utility or provider the report shall also provide the information for the other utility or provider if at any time subsequent to the adoption of this regulation that capacity has reached

prohibited from extending service to any new customer if its facilities fail to satisfy any of the following minimum standards a capacity 1 water facility a proposed subdivisions  no utility shall provide water or establish connections to provide water to a proposed subdivision or to a new customer within a subdivision until the city has issued a certificate of fire flow compliance for that proposed subdivision b new customers  no utility shall provide water or establish connections to provide water to a new customer unless the service location is within a subdivision or area for which the utility has issued a certificate of fire flow compliance    377418 c criteria for issuing certificate i a utility may apply for a certificate of fire flow compliance at any time for any general area to which it currently provides water service each identifiable subdivision may be issued its own certificate of fire flow compliance ii the city shall issue a certificate of fire flow compliance to a utility or any person applying for a certificate upon 1 written application and filing fee in the amount of $2500 2 a designation of the specific area for which the certificate is sought and 3 the presentation of a certified engineers report that states that given the existing storage capacity and distribution system andor the proposed improvement the utility can currently provide a minimum fire flow to the area in the application of 750 gpm with a residual pressure of 20 psi the cost of the engineers report shall be paid by the person or utility requesting the certificate the certificate shall list conditions with particularity iii the engineers report to be provided to the city shall state the residual pressure of water flow to the area at 750 gpm and shall state the sources of the water supply to the area the engineers report shall further state the accuracy of the calculations and the data upon which the calculations are based b the fireflow certificate shall constitute an authorization for the city or utility to extend or provide water services to a particular property or a subdivision the certificate shall not entitle any person to any right or interest it being the primary objective of the city to require the continuous evaluation of existing water facilities and firefighting capability rather than to create any enforceable rights c design minimum water line sizes 1 no new water lines under eight 8 inches in diameter shall be allowed to be installed in a water distribution system 2 the design of the distribution system shall be such that a customer location shall be served from two separate water supply sources this systematic redundancy will help ensure that all customers continue to receive water services in the event of a failure involving one water supply source 3 the table below establishes the maximum number of connections allowed to be made on any existing pipe a utility shall not make any additional connections to a pipe if after doing so there would result a pipe with connections in excess of the maximum number of connections allowed for a pipe of that size table a maximum number of connections maximum line size in inches 150 4 151  250 6 >250 8 and larger    378418 commentary finding and purpose of lift station regulations the city is experiencing substantial growth unchecked this growth can result in taxing the citys public systems and facilities particularly with respect to potable water services there is an increasing public demand for water similarly the lack of sewer trunk lines has increased the request for additional sewer lift stations and pressure mains while the city has made significant strides in improving its water treatment storage and distribution facilities as well as its sewer transmission and treatment facilities it has done so in a catchup mode while the city has caught up so to speak it needs to make sure that as growth and development occurs in the immediate future water systems and facilities are in place to respond to the increased demand for water the city commission finds that it is the in the public interest and in furtherance of the health welfare and safety of the citizens of the city and the residents of the rural areas in the citys extraterritorial jurisdiction that the city adopt minimum design standards for water and sewer systems and minimum treatment and storage capacity requirements for all utility systems providing water to areas under the citys jurisdiction in this connection the city commission wishes to exercise the citys sovereign authority to the fullest extent under the texas constitution and to be limited only as limited in that authority by the acts of the texas legislature to the extent that the citys regulatory jurisdiction overlaps with the regulatory authority of the texas commission on environmental quality it is the city commissions desire that its own regulatory jurisdiction take precedent where so authorized by the texas water other acts of the texas legislature if a clear and irreconcilable conflict arises between the citys purported jurisdiction herein and the jurisdiction of the texas commission on environmental quality of the texas department of health then it is the city commissions objective that the provisions of this regulation be interpreted to be consistent with and subordinate to the jurisdiction of those state agencies on the other hand if the jurisdiction or authority of a state agency indicates only a partial preemption over some regulatory matter it is the desire of the city commission that both the state and local interest be reconciled and that this regulation be interpreted to accomplish objectives that are set out herein adopted  chapter 4  building

integral elements of the comprehensive plan the city commission recognizes that all too often in the past the lack of stringent offstreet parking requirements has resulted in public thoroughfares being relied on by the public to park their motor vehicles this restricts the flow of traffic on public thoroughfares  imposes unnecessary risks and hazards on the traveling public  and impedes the orderly growth of the community in this connection the offstreet parking requirements have the following objectives 1 first and foremost to dedicate streets to the purpose for which they were designed to carry motor vehicle traffic  2 second to retain in city streets the level of intensity of traffic flow as designated by the major thoroughfare plan eg a secondary vehicles to move relatively unimpeded by uncontrolled access to the thoroughfare from onstreet parking  3 third to impose reasonable requirements on property owners to designate offstreet parking areas including for garbage collection and delivery and loading areas on their properties in conformity with acceptable standards  and 4 finally to accomplish these objectives in way that improves the aesthetic value of our

siting of wireless communications towers and antennas the goals of this regulation are to 1 protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas  2 encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas  3 minimize the total number of towers throughout the community  4 strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers  5 encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  6 encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas design siting    418418 landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  7 enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  8 consider the public health and safety of communication towers  and 9 avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower structures in furtherance of these goals city of san juan
