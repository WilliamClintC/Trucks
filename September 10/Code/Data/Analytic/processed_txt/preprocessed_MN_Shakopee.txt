improvement maintenance operation and use of trunk stormwater facilities and regional ponding systems 2the city council has further determined that the stormwater drainage fees imposed by this section are inadequate to pay for the costs of these facilities and systems that are needed to accommodate development in the city the city council has further determined that it would be inequitable to increase the stormwater drainage fees to pay for new trunk stormwater facilities and regional ponding systems because such an increase would require previously developed properties to pay for facilities the need for which is being generated primarily by new development rather than existing development 3these new trunk stormwater facilities and regional ponding systems will be acquired constructed operated used and maintained in accordance with the citys comprehensive stormwater management plan the city council has considered the information recommendations and conclusions contained in the july 1996 revised  trunk stormwater fee justification report prepared by wsb & associates based on all of the above information the city council finds that it is necessary to impose trunk stormwater charges and stormwater storage and treatment charges to provide assurances that aan adequate stormwater drainage system can be financed constructed improved and operated so that stormwater runoff from developing properties within the city can be reasonably accommodated not only within these properties but also by downstream properties  bthe city will be able to acquire property for the construction of a trunk stormwater system as new development takes place so that the stormwater drainage needs of the city are met and so that property owners within the city will be treated fairly

the event or gathering supplied the alcohol or was present bfindings the city council finds that 1alcohol is an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user  2consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public safety from injuries related to alcohol consumption such as alcohol overdose or alcoholrelated traffic collisions  3as a result events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be prevented as much as possible  4events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption often occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults  however there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the activity and in some circumstances provides the alcohol  5even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime it is difficult to prove and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption  and 6a deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession of consumption occurs cdefinitions for the purpose of this section the following

diseases can be minimized by regulating such commercial premises buildings and structures 2the experience of other cities where such commercial premises buildings and structures are present indicates that the risk of spreading the sexuallytransmittable disease of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids is increased by the presence of such premises buildings and structures because the design or
