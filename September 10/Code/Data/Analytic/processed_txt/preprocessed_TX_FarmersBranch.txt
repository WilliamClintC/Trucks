adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain art 1  a 12191977  art 1  a 541987 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood hazard areas by use vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1  b 12191977  art 1  b

such flow from entering the sanitary sewer system the water flow separate meters will not be considered in determining sanitary sewer service charges d the volume charge as set forth in appendix a of

discharging wastewater having a biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content exceeding 250 milligrams per liter to the extent required to prevent the total flow from the city from exceeding the surcharge limits measured at the point of entry to the trinity river authority system with the provision that no user shall be required to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content of wastewater discharged by that user to less than 250 milligrams per liter  or 2 require that any users found to be discharging wastewater having a biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content exceeding 250 milligrams per liter pay their pro rata share of any surcharge imposed upon the city the proportionate part of the total surcharge to be paid by any user shall be
