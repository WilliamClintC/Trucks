sand and gravel may extend to or near the ground surface generally however they lie below the ground surface at varying depths and are covered by an overburden of earth the kind nature and depth of the overburden are factors in determining how a well shall be constructed b unconsolidated formations with nonstable overburden wells constructed in unconsolidated formations which extend the full depth of the well shall have a permanent casing installed governed by the pumping level in the finished well for pumping levels greater than twenty feet 20 below the ground surface the casing shall extend five feet 5 below the pumping level for pumping levels twenty feet 20 or less below the ground surface the casing shall extend ten feet 10 below the pumping level under no conditions shall there be less than twenty feet 20 of permanent casing installed c unconsolidated formations with stable overburden wells constructed in geological formations such as sand gravel which lie below clay glacial till or other relatively stable soil shall have a casing installed governed by the pumping level for pumping levels greater than twenty feet 20 the casing shall extend five feet 5 below the pumping level for pumping levels twenty feet 20 or less the casing shall extend ten feet 10 below the pumping level under no conditions shall there be less than twenty feet 20 of permanent casing installed since the stable overburden cannot be expected to form a continuous contact seal with the casing sealing of the annular opening between the casing and the drill hole must be effected this can be accomplished by constructing an upper drill hole having a diameter four inches 4 greater than the inner diameter of the casing to be installed and extending to a depth of at least twenty feet 20 the upper drill hole shall be sealed with drill cuttings clay slurry or cement grout after the casing is in place d gravel wall construction 1 when an oversized drill hole is constructed to permit the placement of a gravel wall around the well screen the annular opening between the casing and drill hole shall be sealed in the top twenty feet 20 with concrete or cement grout if a permanent outer

accompanied by pertinent data to support the request passed 11141972    drilled wells in consolidated formations a crevice formations 1 limestones and dolomites which are cracked creviced and otherwise channelized should be viewed with suspicion as a source of ground water supply if they are the uppermost formation of the bedrock and have only a shallow mantle of earth overburden in general such formations are recharged overburden and therefore the thickness and continuity of the overburden for some radial distance from the well are important factors related to the quality of water which will be present in the cracks and crevices for the formation 2 the less the thickness of earth overburden the greater is the potential for contaminants to enter the limestone formation experience indicates that when contaminants have entered such a formation the upper water bearing portion is the most affected it is desirable therefore that the well draw water from below the upper portion of the limestone formation 3 unfortunately there are no precise means for predetermining the exact depth in any locality to which a casing shall be set which will ensure a continuing supply of safe water for the life of the well although certain minimum requirements are established in subsections a4a and a4b of this section the constructor shall on the basis of his knowledge and experience consider whether these minimums are adequate in each well project 4 because of the indeterminant factors involved in assuring that a continuing safe water will be produced by a well in crevice or cracked limestone or dolomite which is the upper formation of the bedrock and is overlain by a mantle of earth having a thickness less than thirty feet 30 for a radius of onefourth  1  4  mile around

of shrubs by name common and scientific and type evergreen or deciduous i details of erosion control for natural landscaping areas e design guidelines in preparing landscape plans the following shall be followed 1 general landscape design principles a landscape improvements should serve to integrate the project to the site with particular sensitivity to the natural topography watercourses and existing vegetation preservation of the existing landscape material and land forms should be taken into account particularly where mature trees are a part of the site this is of particular importance in cases where specimen trees groves or tree lines or treelined watercourses are present b landscape improvements should serve to enhance the appearance of the site especially as viewed from an adjacent public rightofway effective yearround screening shall be provided to lessen the visual prominence of parking lots service yards loading docks public utility structures and unsightly appurtenances c innovative landscape design proposals that promote sustainability reduce irrigation requirements and that utilize effective onsite stormwater management techniques are encouraged thoughtful selection and placement of plant material and groundcovers based on ecological principles are also encouraged d the aesthetic aspect of landscape improvements should be considered both at installation and maturity groupings of trees or other plantings are recommended for optimal visual effect and ease of maintenance 2 scale scale and nature of landscape materials and planting bed size should be appropriate to the site and structures larger buildings and sites may accommodate and be enhanced by larger plant material plant groupings and planting beds 3 selection and layout plant material should be selected for its form texture color and concern for its size at maturity and adaptation to climate conditions a listing of recommended plantings has been provided in table 1 for reference this list is not all inclusive and may continue to be modified as climate conditions change wherever possible large planting areas should be provided in groupings and masses to provide a more naturalistic appearance wherever appropriate use of native woody and herbaceous plant materials is encouraged in small planting areas within parking lots trees and shrubs should be planted in groups with massing appropriate to and in harmony with buildings circulation stormwater management and neighboring landscapes energy conservation should also be considered when determining layout of selection and layout of plant material for instance suntolerant plant materials should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from summer sun and shadetolerant plant materials should be concentrated on the north side of buildings to dissipate the effects of winter winds a texture plants differ in texture according to foliage color size and density a variety of texture will add interest and depth to the landscape design for example coarser plants larger leaves dense foliage may work to anchor corners  medium textured materials can gradually transition to fine textured plants in massing coarser textured plants are usually more effective when placed at greater distances from common viewing locations groups of finer textured plants are typically more effective near walkways and entrances and in courtyards of buildings or plazas b form among the most important design qualities of a plant is form which includes columnar round vase weeping pyramidal and oval forms plants of contrasting shapes may provide variety and interest by accenting a group of plants of another form for example evergreen trees exhibit pyramidal forms while many crabapples are round to oval plantings that combine two 2 or more forms may effectively buffer or soften building facades fences and other structures the dominant use of native trees and shrubs that display strongly horizontal branch patterns and layered flowering forms is basic to effective use of the unified prairie style associated historically and ecologically with this region and is encouraged c color color can be used to unify or contrast plantings on a site it is essential to consider the varying colors exhibited by a plant in all seasons most importantly use of perennials andor annuals color can be used to call attention to entryways and other focal points d repetition a design is tied together repeated use of a small number of plant species sizes colors forms or textures throughout the site too much repetition can result in monotony so it is important to find a balance natural landscaping techniques using a diverse palette of randomly mixed prairie forbs and grasses will provide repetition and unity throughout the planting area and across the seasons on smaller sites it is recommended to keep the plant palette short and simple e massing massing ties in with scale and repetition in general shrubs perennials and annuals are massed or grouped together to achieve a more dramatic effect for example large sites may have shrubs in groupings of one hundred 100 or more large buildings and sites are complemented with larger material and greater massing of shrubs andor color f variety variety adds interest and liveliness to the design it provides a few unlike qualities to contrast with those qualities that are alike and duplicated as part of repetition variety is achieved use of different forms textures colors and plants 4 stormwater infiltration and enhanced water quality wherever possible preserve restore and integrate natural drainage patterns and features including swales filter strips and wetlands or rain gardens vegetated with native plant systems all rooftop drains overflow scuppers or other devices used to convey stormwater from roofs shall be coordinated with the adjacent landscaping and positioned appropriately above grade to prevent erosion in conjunction with native landscaping as determined by the village manager or hisher designee curbs may be provided with openings to accommodate surface collection of stormwater runoff in vegetated swales and detention facilities the intention should be to slow stormwater runoff increase onsite infiltration and filter suspended solids and contaminants in support of onsite stormwater management and treatment strategies that reduce or control costs to the community 5 berming earthen berms and existing topography should whenever practical be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site bermed areas should be designed to resemble natural land forms whenever possible the maximum permissible slope is three to one  refer to chapter 151 subdivision and land development of this title for seeding and sodding requirements on different slopes 6 facade and foundation treatments landscape improvements should be provided to enhance architectural features and to add visual interest adjacent to large expanses of building walls landscape improvements should also be provided around the foundation area of buildings to soften their appearance and integrate them to their surrounding site 7 fence treatments when fencing is used provide landscaping which includes a variety of plant material height color and texture this landscaping should buffer soften or minimize the visual monotony of long expanses of fencing 8 miscellaneous screening standards functional activities within and surrounding the development must be considered in the design of the landscape improvements particular attention should be paid towards screening mechanical equipment electrical generators dish antennas air conditioning units or other visible outside utility equipment as well as service areas including dumpster enclosures or other waste receptacles loading docks and bicycle parking areas enhance ground signs walkways entrances bus stops and other pedestrian areas  screen and buffer pedestrian and public areas such as outdoor seatingeating areas from circulation drives and parking areas  and direct attention to focal areas and main entrances 9 miscellaneous placement standards only perennials and groundcovers less than nine inches 9 in height at maturity shall be allowed within a fourfoot 4 radius around fire hydrants valve vaults hose bibs manholes fire department connections and other site features as deemed necessary by the village site lines to all exterior fire alarm strobe lights or other visual alarms shall be maintained at all times additionally plant material branching higher than two feet 2 and lower than six feet 6 above top of curb shall not be planted or maintained in a sight visibility triangle as defined by the village manager or hisher designee 10 multifamily site interior landscaping on multifamily parcels with more than one 1 structure the open space between buildings should be appropriately landscaped to provide screening of adjacent dwelling units screening and shading to improve energy efficiency and a visually appealing living environment landscape features such as trees and shrubs a combination of evergreen and deciduous groundcovers flowering annuals and perennials permitted natural landscaping areas rain gardens vegetated swales filter strips and berming should be used as appropriate to enhance the overall appearance and function of the open space area f mulch and planting beds shrub and tree planting beds shall be mulched with shredded bark mulch to a minimum depth of three inches 3 groundcover plantings including perennial and annual flowers shall be mulched to a minimum depth of one inch 1 stone mulch is not permitted around plantings but may be used in a limited width of not more than eighteen inches 18 as required around exterior walls of food processing facilities or restaurant buildings limited areas of large washed stone mulch or uncrushed natural stone cobbles which are fourinch 4 diameter or larger may be used to prevent stormwater erosion or vehicular damage to planting bed or parking lot island areas synthetic mulch is also not permitted around plantings but may be used in play areas or heavily used walking paths g detention and retention facilities landscaping shall be required around the perimeter of all retention and detention basins from the normal water line to a minimum of six inches 6 above the high water line such landscaping shall primarily consist of native prairie and emergent plantings but may also include tree and shrub plantings in an arrangement that will create an aesthetically pleasing and ecologically functional environment such landscaping shall be in conformance with current best management practices bmps as determined by the

public open spaces 4 to provide the general location and typical cross sections for all streets 5 to establish a longterm trail network that is consistent with streets and an open space system b block size a walkable block size is a critical element in creating a pedestrian friendly urban environment typical suburban large superblocks discourage walking and transit use and encourage reliance on automobiles for mobility shorter blocks also allow for more mixed use development opportunities unimpeded block length is the distance drivers may travel on a particular street segment without being required to slow or stop streets exceeding six hundred 600 feet in unimpeded block length typically have significantly higher cases of speeding limiting the unimpeded street length to approximately six hundred 600 feet helps deter speeding pedestrian friendly environment shorter block lengths also reduce the likelihood of jaywalking a connected pattern of short blocks provides pedestrians a
