familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example town manager can be added between 204 town council and town attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supp no 8 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the
