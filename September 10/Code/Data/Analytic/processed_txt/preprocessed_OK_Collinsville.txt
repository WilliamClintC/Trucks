maintenance of roadside ditches shall be the responsibility of 24 the homeowners association of the subdivision and shall be included within the covenants of the subdivision c easements roadside ditches located within the street rightofway do not require a drainage easement roadside ditches located otherwise shall have a dedicated drainage easement extending from the street rightofway to two

open channel flow unless otherwise noted or excepted the design of roadside ditches shall conform with the previous requirements of 0509 open channels the engineer may require additional analysis or

additional freeboard or protection from velocity induced erosion k vertical alignmentlongitudinal slope in many cases the grade of the side ditch will follow the profile grade of the roadway these template ditches are generally constrained not only in profile grade but also in alignment and cross section by the geometric and safety standards applicable to the project in addition maximum and minimum allowable velocities will define the upper and lower bounds of the longitudinal slope for special ditches whose slope differs from that of the profile grade the engineer may require a minimum

lining linings for roadside ditches may be classified as either flexible or rigid the difference between flexible and rigid channel linings is their response to changing channel shape flexible linings are able to conform to changes in the 28 channel shape while rigid linings will not where flexible linings are capable of withstanding design velocities they are preferred over rigid linings flexible linings are constructed of the following materials i sod or seeded grasses ii erosion control blankets iii turf reinforcement blanket iv machined riprap v wireenclosed rock gabions or mattresses rigid linings may consist of either castinplace concrete or grouted riprap the use of rigid linings for roadside ditches is discouraged p erosion control the designer shall verify that both temporary and permanent vegetative linings are suited to the hydraulic conditions of the channel for which they are specified and are capable of resisting erosion until they are permanently established sod should be placed parallel to the direction of flow and should be secured in place with pins or staples seeded grasses should incorporate erosion control blankets to insure soil stability until permanent vegetation is established ditches subject to highly erosive flows may require the use of permanent turf reinforcement mats the temporary erosion control plan during construction shall be sufficient to prevent sedimentation of drainageways drainage structures and flood plain areas that could result in reduced flow capacity excessive bank erosion and erosion around structures or damage to adjoining property the permanent erosion control plan shall be sufficient to  permanently stabilize all disturbed areas with permanent vegetation including slopes and embankments  prevent erosion from exit
