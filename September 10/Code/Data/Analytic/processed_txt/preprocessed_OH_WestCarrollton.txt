needed to direct the public as the appearance of the city is marred by the excessive number oversized and poorly designed signs both residential and business property values are adversely affected therefore the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs permitted should comply with the standards of this chapter in order to reduce the aforementioned effects the signs of least value to the people of west carrollton are those which carry commercial messages other than the advertisement of any product service event person institution or business located on the premises where the sign is located in view of the foregoing any sign that does not conform to the regulations of this or any subsequent amendment thereto shall therefore be deemed a public nuisance and as such must

shall not be planted in such a manner that the natural dripline of an average adult tree of the species planted will be any closer than three feet 3 feet  of a pedestrian walkway or parking lot 6diversity as a rule streets are often more attractive when they contain only one kind of tree however the use of several varieties adds interest to the plantings of the city and insures against the loss of all trees in case of an epidemic disease striking any one species the international society of arboricultures diversification formula will be used as a guideline to prevent over planting of a single tree species or family this formula states that out of the total tree planting no more than 10% should be from one family and no more than 5% should be of one species see which follows the recommended trees for west carrollton l recommended trees for west carrollton this list of recommended trees for west carrollton is designed to encourage an imaginative selection of landscape trees careful selection will prevent an overdependence on a few species this compilation will be useful to residents nurserymen horticulturalists landscapers developers and landscape architects planting and maintaining a diverse urban forest is the goal of west carrolltons tree programs this idea is reflected in landscape plan approval by the west carrollton planning commission and in the tree planting and replacement by the city along an individual street uniform street tree plantings are desirable however overuse of a few species is inevitable without a conscious effort to vary plant species and families this list is divided into three size categories large trees which mature at a height of 50 feet or more group a  medium trees reaching a mature height of between 30 and 50 feet group b  and small trees which range from 10 to 30 feet at maturity group c tree lawn sizes must accommodate the tree size planted group a > 7 feet  group b 47 feet  group c 34 feet  use under utility lines is limited to small trees group c although medium trees may be planted as close as 10 lateral feet to utility lines trees are alphabetized by their scientific name with the common name given species

that will result in safer access to property and safer traffic flow it is recognized that land use and site planning issues are directly linked to the capacity of roadways to efficiently move traffic area and provide safe access to adjoining property it is also recognized that achieving an appropriate balance between roadway access to adjoining property and the ability of roadways to carry will not only reduce future congestion and accident rates but will also enhance emergency vehicle response times these requirements are further intended to help achieve the following objectives 1 provide a standard set of analytic tools and format for preparing traffic impact studies 2 allow the community to assess the effects that a proposed project may have on the community by outlining information needed and evaluation procedures to be used 3 help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of the proposed use 4 reduce the negative traffic impacts created by individual developments which may negatively impact such developments by helping to ensure the transportation system can accommodate the expected traffic safely and efficiently 5 realize a comprehensive approach to the overall impacts of various developments along a corridor or within part of a community rather than a piecemeal approach 6 provide direction to
