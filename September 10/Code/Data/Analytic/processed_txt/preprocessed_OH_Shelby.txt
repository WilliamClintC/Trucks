124402minor subdivisions  124403major subdivisions however land divided under certain specifications or conditions is not classified as a subdivision and therefore the regulations of  124402 and 124403 do not apply adivision of land that is a subdivision 1when a parcel of land shown as a unit or contiguous units on the last preceding tax rule is divided into two or more parcels sites or lots any one of which is less than five acres for the purpose now or in the future of transfer of ownership 2improvement of one or more parcels for residential and commercial or industrial structures

common use or as easements for public sewer water storm drainage or other public facilities bdivision of land that is not a subdivision 1some divisions of land are not subdivisions 2if a division of land is not a subdivision then these regulations do not apply and no plat is required 3the following divisions are not subdivisions adivision of a parcel into two or more parcels all of which are five acres or more not involving new streets public or private or easements of access  bsale or exchange of parcels between adjoining landowners if no additional building sites are created  ctransfer of an existing piece of land as a whole that has been previously recorded by a metes and bounds description  and dnormally the transfer of a lot that is recorded as a lot in a major subdivision the transfer of a part of such a lot will not be a subdivision unless it is less than five acres and involves new streets public or private or easements of access or unless it creates additional building sites and is not a sale or exchange between adjoining landowners 4if the land to be divided is a subdivision then the owners will have to proceed with formal platting requirements in  124403 for major subdivisions unless the division of land meets the minor subdivision requirements in  124402 rc   5if the criteria for a minor subdivision are met then no plat is required by the city planning commission however city charter  98 requires a plat for any subdivision 6if the criteria for a minor subdivision are not met then the major subdivision requirements must be followed unless a hardship exists to qualify for a variance cwhat is a minor subdivision 1ait is a division of land that 1must be a division of a parcel along an existing public street  2must not involve the opening widening or extension of any street or road  3must involve no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided  and 4must not be contrary to applicable platting subdividing or zoning regulations bohio rc  sets forth other requirements to be met by a minor subdivision 2keep these definitions in mind athe full definition of a minor subdivision above boriginal tract a contiguous quantity of land held by one person or in common ownership which land has not been platted by the existing owner this means 1a tract can be original to one person and not to another 2original does not mean initial source 3subdivision ownership is permitted based on oag opinion 71083 3completely subdivided a tract that is divided into as many lots as the subdivider intends for the tract aa specific subdivider may later decide to increase the number of lots in a subdivision but to do so assuming there are more than five lots as a result it would be necessary to replat the original tract bit is possible for a tract to be completely subdivided and then be further subdivided by a party who purchases or takes title to a parcel in a subdivision large enough to be divided 4the ohio attorney general has concluded atract means a contiguous quantity of land undivided by lot lines boriginal means a tract which has not been divided under its present ownership coriginal tract means a contiguous quantity of land held by one person or in common which land has not been platted by the existing owner dthe phrase involving no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided applies only to the necessity for replatting to accomplish changes in an already subdivided tract examples example a  images0002976jpg  example b  images0002979jpg  1a owns 20

from the 15acre parcel aa subdivision  yes bis it a minor subdivision does it involved no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided what is the original tract  15

55 by the soil conservation service of the united states department of agriculture and its ohio supplement shall be used to determine stormwater runoff passed 1061986  148614 stormwater runoff control criteria stormwater runoff control addresses both peak rate and total volume of runoff athe peak rate of runoff from an area after development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area before development for all storms up to a 100year frequency 24hour storm in addition if it is found that a proposed development will increase the volume of runoff from an area the peak rate of runoff from certain more frequent storms must be controlled further there are two reasons why increases in volume of runoff require a control standard more restrictive than controlling just the predevelopment conditions first increases in volume mean runoff will be flowing for a longer period of time when routed watershed these longer flows may join at some point downstream thereby creating peak flows and the problems associated with peak flow flooding this is known as the routing problem second longer flow periods of large runoff quantities place a highly erosive stress on natural channels this stress can be minimized by reducing the rate of discharge the permissible peak rate shall be determined as follows 1determine the total volume of runoff from a oneyear frequency 24 hour storm occurring over the area before and after development 2determine the percent of increase in volume due to development and using this percentage pick the critical storm from the following table  percentage of increase in volume of runoff critical storm for discharge equal to or greater than and less than limitation yrs  10 1 10 20 2 20 50 5 50 100 10 100 250 25 250 500 50 500  100  bthe peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear frequency storm occurring over the same area under predevelopment conditions storms of less frequent occurrence longer return period than the critical storm shall have a peak rate of runoff not greater than for the same storm under predevelopment conditions as an example if the total volume is shown to be increased by 35% the critical storm is a fiveyear storm the peak rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear frequency storm under predevelopment conditions in the area the runoff from a more intense storm need only be controlled so as not to exceed the predevelopment peak rate from the same frequency of storm cstorage volume does not have to be provided for offsite upstream areas flow from such areas will be routed drainage system in the development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the onsite system passed 1061986  148615 preparing a stormwater management plan aa stormwater management plan is required for developments
