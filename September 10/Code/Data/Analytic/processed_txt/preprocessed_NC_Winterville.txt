leave the water running while shaving or brushing teeth install a waterfilled plastic jug or a toilet tank bag in your toilet tank to reduce the water used per flush do not use a brick which may crumble and prevent the flapper from closing properly check for leaks by dropping a small amount of food coloring in the toilet tank if color appears in the bowl you have a leak take shorter showers

this chapter o312 passed 7142014  5502 authority the town council is authorized to adopt this chapter pursuant to north carolina law including but not limited to of the constitution of north carolina  the town charter  gs 1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder  session law 2004163  gs 160a174 gs 160a185 o312 passed 7142014  5503 findings it is hereby determined mat adevelopment and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  bthese changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and cthese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage storm water runoff from development sites dfurther the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii storm water rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum storm water controls such as those included in this chapter etherefore the town council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of storm water runoff and discharge o312 passed 7142014  5504 purpose ageneral the purpose of this chapter is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment storm water runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal storm water systems it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment storm water runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources bspecific this chapter seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3establishing minimum postdevelopment storm water management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water runoff quantity and quality  4establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural storm water bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment storm water management standards  5encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for storm water and the preservation of greenspace riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of storm water
