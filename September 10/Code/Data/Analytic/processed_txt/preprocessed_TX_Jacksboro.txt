findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property healthand safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for floodprotection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase inflood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous toother lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 92507  passed 11121  r passed 21121 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and privatelosses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at theexpense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone andsewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas insuch a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area passed 92507  passed 11121  r passed 21121 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or causeexcessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected againstflood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which areinvolved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the

area and height to provide a motorist withadequate time and travel distance to detect a sign read and understand its contents and then execute an appropriate drivingmaneuver factors that would impede this process making the sign smaller lowering its height would be at odds with traffic safetyprinciples and should be avoided by a local city assuming that the goal of public and motorist safety is

become a matter of great interest at the municipal level acrossthe united states this interest has been spurred primarily by the availability of emc technology its increasing quality and the interestof sign owners  end users in utilizing the technology 2 most emc signs installed today are illuminated via leds or light emitting diodes leds are the current industry standard for theillumination of emc signs and it is likely that this will remain so for the near future until another technology is perfected that is bothtolerant to outdoor environmental conditions sufficiently bright and cost effective there may be other sources of illumination in thenear future so the term emc is intended to refer to any onpremises sign that can display messages and change them at regularintervals via a computercontrolled interface 3 from a legal and practical standpoint experience indicates that local control of emc signs is preferred over an outright ban somecommunities have attempted to implement a prohibition on emc signs but it should be noted that there has been a heavy costassociated with these types of bans  legal and administrative costs to the city to defend such a ban  acrimony created within thecommunity by the denial of this new communication technology without a scientific or traffic safety research basis  loss of the benefitscreated by enhanced emc communication in addition a substantial percentage of emc signs are installed at churches municipalbuildings libraries fire and rescue facilities hospitals and outpatient medical offices therefore a more prudent and balancedapproach to emc regulation based on sound scientific principles may serve the local ahj in both the long and short terms 4in regard to traffic safety issues and emc signs a local city can rely on this statement to be true up to this time research has shownno correlation between emc signs and traffic accidents and emc signs have not been found to be a distraction having impact on thedriving task or to cause unsafe driving behavior that causes an accident in driver distraction studies some have offered opinions andtheories about emc signs and so called distractions but there has been no direct scientific research on these distractions and emcsigns the term distraction in and of itself is a pejorative term suggesting a negative outcome or result what research on motoristbehavior has shown is that drivers engage in a wide variety of activities while operating a motor vehicle and some for two 2 secondsor longer some activities that drivers engage in have a positive effect on motorist performance even though the drivers eyes are awayfrom the road examples of this would be checking the rear view mirror checking the side mirrors or checking the speedometer otheractivities that drivers engage in have a demonstrated negative effect on motorist performance  most notably cell phone use and textingwhile driving finally other activities appear to have no effect either way  positive or negative  on driver performance and emc signsfall into this category drivers look at emc signs but their driving performance is not affected and that is why accident and driverdistraction research fails to show any correlation with emc signs 5 all stakeholders agree that emc lighting levels must be adjusted at night in order for an emc to be visible and legible during the daythe emc sign must be energized or illuminated  it must have sufficient brightness to be seen while the sun is present at nighthowever emc brightness must be adjusted to a much lower level so that the sign is not overbright andor create glare so that amotorist cannot read the sign most emc manufacturers have technology built into their products to accomplish this lighting leveladjustment typically using photocells andor software timing controls with the general lighting standardsof this in section  sign illumination standards to insure that all emcs have an appropriate lighting level at nightbased on the needs of the motorist and traffic safety this standard is a luminance standard or an objective measurement and controlof the actual brightness of the emc sign based on onpremises sign research 6 regulations for display time on an emc sign display time is sometimes also referred to as a changerate and is intended to describe the rate at which a message can be changed on the emc display panel   am   277350 7 emc signs are capable of a wide range of dynamic message and image presentations as well as visual effects including simplescrolling or moving message effects to full video display since no negative correlation between onpremises emc signs and trafficsafety has been demonstrated by current research any restriction on the various operational capabilities of emc signs are necessarilyimposed for aesthetic purposes only in placing operational restrictions on emc sign use in residential and professional zones as anaesthetic consideration this model accepts the premises that these zones are not normally commercially active and do not require themore visually dynamic forms of on premises communication necessary for the rapid transfer of commercial speech in commercialandor industrial zones since neither an aesthetic nor traffic safety justification can be advanced for placing similar restrictions on the dynamic operationalcapabilities of emc signs in commercial andor industrial zones the model  except for prohibition of flashing and provision that videodisplay be subject to special exception  places no specific prohibitions on emc operational usage in those zones the city however inassessing local conditions involving community aesthetic considerations may place specific usage restrictions as it determines to beappropriate or as the model suggests regarding video usage make certain operational usage features of emc signs within itsjurisdiction are subject to special exception the prohibition on emc video display is intended to cover the display of videos films motion video clips and streaming video imagesthat are not a part of the standard emc software it is not intended to prohibit the use of standard effects that are a part of the emcsoftware capabilities which sometimes can be confused with actual video these permitted effects are generally shown in thebackground of a message flag waving leaves falling clouds passing and are not the primary emc content or message but merely adesign element intended to compliment the primary communication each city may make a determination in regard to zones whereemc video capabilities enhance the character of the zone and where they may be prohibited based on local conditions sec 132000 passed 32320 illumination standards signs may be illuminated consistent with the following standards 1 a sign in any district may be illuminated at night signs that are illuminated at night may not exceed amaximum luminance level of seven hundred fifty 750 cdm or nits regardless of the method of illumination 2 signs that have external illumination whether the lighting is mounted above or below the sign face orpanel shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are fully shielded 3 all illuminated signs must comply with the maximum luminance level of seven hundred fifty 750 cdm ornits at least onehalf hour before apparent sunset as determined by the national oceanic and atmosphericadministration noaa us department of commerce for the specific geographic location and date allilluminated signs must comply with this maximum luminance level throughout the night if the sign is energizeduntil apparent sunrise as determined by the noaa at which time the sign may resume luminance levelsappropriate for daylight conditions when required or appropriate 4 onpremises signs do not constitute a form of outdoor lighting at night and are exempt from any otheroutdoor lighting regulations that the city of jacksboro has adopted or will adopt in the future clarification notes the intent of these sign illumination provisions is to set a clear and uniform lighting level for illuminated onpremises signs at nightbased upon research the needs of the motorist and traffic safety this lighting level standard is simple and easy to understandexperience has shown that outdoor lighting and illumination regulations can often become very complicated and use concepts andterms that even professionals do not fully understand the goal of this model to help create enforceable standards that requirea minimum of administrative resources yet can be applied uniformly the lighting standard provided controls the actual brightness of the sign or luminance of the sign  of the sign face the sign letters thesign panel etc this standard is based on existing onpremises sign research the correct lighting level at night for an onpremises signhas been confirmed both in a test track setting and in real world environments the maximum luminance level noted by the model willinsure that signs have sufficient brightness at night so that they can be detected and read by motorists at night in the interests of trafficsafety the luminance standard also provides flexibility to both manufacturers and cities the luminance of a sign can be determined at theplace of manufacture prior to installation or in the field after the sign is installed if multiple signs of the same design and manufactureare installed then only one 1 sign needs to be measured as the representative sample thereby conserving resources   am   278350 this model recommends that other light measurement methods be avoided in regard to onpremises signs for instancean illuminance standard or including ambient lighting conditions as a part of a complicated formula because these methods do notaccount for true sign brightness which in regard to traffic safety is the primary determinant as to whether a sign is visible and legible tothe motorist it should also be noted that research has shown that onpremises signs are not a factor in creating socalled light trespass or lightspillage conditions regulators often confuse the fact that an onpremises sign can be seen from a distance at night with light trespass instead onpremises signs can be detected from a distance because they have proper sign brightness or luminance at night and notbecause they project a great deal of unnecessary lighting to surrounding areas this model that a light trespassmeasurement method aimed at sign illuminance may result in a more confusing and complicated regulatory scheme and maycompromise public safety sec 132100 passed 32320 signs clarification notes the purpose of regulations related to nonconforming signs is to insure that existing signs installed by valid permit that are madenonconforming by adoption of any new sign continue and that the new sign regulations will not cause unnecessary burdensthe owner of a sign with a valid permit has a legitimate expectation that the sign can be used for the period of its useful life theextinguishment of nonconforming signs is sometimes goal at the local city level under the theory that these signs are regulatorynuisances a avorable outcome for all stakeholders in regard to the treatment of nonconforming signs is most often achieved when allthe interested parties are included in the process the intent of these regulations is not to force all signs to be immediately brought into conformance with current regulations  instead theintent is to gradually bring existing signs into conformance most sign codes contain provisions for nonconforming signs the degree to which a sign code can extinguish nonconforming signs is also controlled by individual state law and particular attentionshould be given to these rules 1 nonconforming permanent signs may continue to exist after passage of this code nonconforming signswill be removed and changed in accordance with the provisions of this code 2 permanent signs and sign structures that are moved removed replaced or structurally altered must bebrought into conformance with the sign regulations however nonconforming signs required to be movedbecause of public rightofway improvements may be reestablished removable faces or sign panel inserts in acabinet style sign may also be changed by right and such change does not constitute a structural alteration nortrigger loss of nonconforming status 3 nonconforming temporary signs must be removed within two 2 months of the passage of this code 4 ownership the status of a nonconforming sign is not affected by changes in ownership 5 once a sign is altered to conform or is replaced with a conforming sign the nonconforming rights for thatsign are lost and a nonconforming sign may not be reestablished 6 loss of nonconforming sign status a discontinuance  see definition of abandoned sign b destruction  when a sign or sign structure is removed or intentionally destroyed replacement signsand sign structures must comply with the current

when the building code of the city of jacksboro or any building code enacted after the passage of thissign code calls for sealed sign design construction plans to be submitted as a part of any sign permitapplication this requirement is not compulsory as it relates to on premises signs regulated under this sign code clarification notes some state and local jurisdictions have interpreted certain language in the international s international building ibc in regard to construction documents and construction permit applications to require socalled sealed sign designs or plans as apart of the routine sign permit application process this reading is not entirely accurate and has caused confusion and inefficiencieswithout increasing public safety or increasing the quality of sign construction in general enforcement of local building code regulations and sign code electrical regulations will insure that standard onpremisessigns are properly installed and that public safety is protected requirement of a sealed plan for a simple wall sign or low mountedmonument sign or for types of sign projects that are repetitively installed using the same installation system does not add to the value ofthe sign nor change how the signs will be mounted nor automatically increase public safety the sign installer is generally the expert inthese areas and will install the sign in the appropriate manner based on already established methods and industry acceptedprocedures there will be sign projects however that are of such size and scope that cities may want to require the services of a licensed engineerin order to confirm that the sign installation details are correct for site and geographic conditions the criteria to determine when sealedplans are required will vary from locality to locality and the city therefore will create its own set of rules for engineering requirements the intent of this section on engineering standards is to create a mechanism to determine when sealed sign plans are required andwhen they are not the requirement for sealed plans will be triggered when the sign project achieves such scope as determined by thecity that the services of an engineer or architect will insure the city that proper engineering principles are being applied   am   280350 c clearances  1 vision clearance areas  vision clearance areas are triangular shaped areas located at
