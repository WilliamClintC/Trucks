serves as a guide to the location of ordinances included in the system the numbering system used in this republication is the same system used in the original codification each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter generally the figure after the dash is a threedigit figure the first digit of which represents the article within the chapter exceptions to this occur when there is too much material in an article to accommodate this system and in chapters 16 19 and 20 indices the indices have been prepared with the greatest of care each particular item has been placed under several headings some of the headings

control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of keller are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands   2 3519 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning

industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules a if the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed by this article or by a discharge permit issued hereunder because the united states environmental protection agency requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entitys wastewater pretreatment program the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail b the director of public works is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection a to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits if the industrial user already has a discharge permit the director of public works may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits an

4 a bypass is prohibited and the director of public works may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section b the director of public works may approve an anticipated

should match the minimum design criteria for the proposed future roadway type 2 geometric design a general geometrics of city streets may be defined as the geometry of the curbs or pavement areas which governs the movement of traffic within the confines of the rightsofway included in the geometrics are the pavement width degree of curvature width of traffic lanes parking lanes or turning lanes median width separating opposing traffic lanes median nose radii curb radii at street intersections crown height cross fall geometric shapes of islands separating traffic movements and other features since city streets are differentiated by their functions and location there is also a variance in the geometry which describes the path vehicular traffic should follow b design speed the design speed is a primary factor in the horizontal and vertical alignment on city streets and thoroughfares design features such as curvature superelevation radii for turning movements and sight distance are directly related to the design speed the design speed also affects features such as lane widths pavement width pavement crossfall pavement crown and clearances the design speed is defined as the approximate maximum speed that can be maintained safely by a vehicle over a given section of road when conditions are so favorable that the design features of the roadway govern the speed limit or posted speed is the maximum legal speed set by local authorities for a certain roadway or area the design speed should never be less than the likely legal speed limit for arterials and collectors the various street and thoroughfare classifications which make up the system within the city of keller require different design speeds according to their use and location refer to table no 1 for design speeds for each roadway classification lower design speeds will be permitted for all classifications for unusual conditions terrain or alignment c horizontal alignment the horizontal geometrics of the streets and thoroughfares include the segment of geometric design associated with the alignment intersections pavement widths and related geometric elements the various classifications utilizing the design speed as a control must have certain horizontal and vertical geometrics to provide a safe economical facility for use by the public i horizontal curves and superelevation the alignment of the streets and thoroughfares is usually determined by the alignment of the existing rightofway or structures which cannot be relocated changes in the direction of a street or thoroughfare are minimized by constructing a simple curve having a radius which is compatible with the speed of vehicular traffic to increase the safety and reduce discomfort to drivers traversing a curved portion of a street or thoroughfare the pavement may be superelevated curvature in the alignment of arterials is allowed under certain conditions but the greater traffic volume and the higher vehicle speeds which accompany these thoroughfares tend to increase the number of accidents when curving of alignment occurs curves in the alignment of minor streets usually provide aesthetic value to residential neighborhoods without affecting the orderly flow of traffic or safety a recommended minimum radius of horizontal curvature for different street types is shown in table no 1 these standards are based on traffic consisting of typical present day automobiles operating under optimum weather conditions there are other important considerations in the design of curves on thoroughfares including the location of intersecting streets drives bridges and other topographic features minor residential streets intersecting a collector street or major street will have a tangent section of centerline at least fifty feet 50 in length measured from the rightofway line of the collector or major street  however no such tangent is required when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater than four hundred feet 400 with the center located on the collector street or major street rightofway line within a reverse curve there will be a tangent section of centerline not less than one hundred feet 100 long ii turning lanes turning lanes shall conform to the standards outlined in of this unified development  street intersections the intersection at grade of all thoroughfares will be at or near an angle of ninety degrees 90 streets shall intersect at no less than an eighty degree 80 angle curb radii required for intersections at ninety degrees 90 are specified in table no 1 the radii required for intersections at less than ninety degrees 90 will be determined using the design data for various vehicles as shown in table no 2 the location of any median nose will be so located that traffic will clear it while making a left turn other considerations include adequate clearance between the median nose and on the intersecting thoroughfare and location of the median nose to properly clear the pedestrian crosswalks reference the city of keller standard construction details table no 2 design vehicle criteria intersecting streets passenger p single unit truck su tractor semitrailer combination wb50 local with local x local with collector x local with arterial x collector with collector x arterial with collector x arterial with arterial x fire lane and alley alignment x refer to aashtos geometric design of highways and street for design vehicle information and figures d vertical alignment the vertical alignment of all thoroughfares should be designed to insure the safe operation of vehicles by the traveling public and should allow easy access to adjacent property i street grades the intersection design of two 2 thoroughfares will include grades which will result in a plane surface or at least a surface which approximates a plane surface a vehicle traveling on either thoroughfare should be able to traverse the intersection at the design speed without discomfort to accomplish a smooth transition crossfall toward the median of one lane of each thoroughfare may be required a storm drainage inlet may also be required in the median in presenting the grades of intersecting thoroughfares in the paving plans profiles of all four 4 curbs of a thoroughfare will be shown as a continuous grade intersection of the other thoroughfare  minimum grades minimum longitudinal grades for streets and thoroughfares are required to ensure proper flow of surface drainage toward inlets the minimum grade required for all roadways shall be 065 percent all valley gutters should be a minimum of eight feet 8 wide and constructed of reinforced concrete and will have a minimum grade of 065 percent  maximum grades maximum longitudinal grades will be compatible with the type of facility and the accompanying characteristics including the design speed traffic conditions and sight distance collectors and arterials must move large volumes of traffic at faster speeds and flatter grades will better accommodate these characteristics truck and bus traffic on these type facilities often controls traffic movement particularly if steep grades prevent normal speeds the normal maximum street grades allowed for keller streets are specified in table no 1 steeper grades may be permitted for short lengths where required by topographical features or restricted alignment if approved by the director of public works or city engineer  cross fall on undivided streets the maximum difference in curb elevations will not exceed fivetenths of a foot 05 on divided streets cross slope of the traffic lanes will be inch per foot minimum and inch per foot maximum ii vertical curves when two 2 longitudinal street grades intersect at a point of vertical intersection pvi and the algebraic difference in the grades is one percent 10% or greater a vertical curve is required vertical curves are utilized in roadway design to affect a gradual change between tangent grades and should result in a design which is safe comfortable in operation pleasing in appearance and adequate for drainage the vertical curve will be formed by a simple parabola and may be a crest vertical curve or a sag vertical curve iii stopping sight distance  crest vertical curve when a vertical curve is required it must not interfere with the ability of drivers to see a length of street ahead should they be required to suddenly stop this length of street called the stopping sight distance should be of sufficient length to enable a person in a vehicle having a height of eye of three and three quarters feet 375 above the pavement and traveling at or near design speed to stop before reaching an object in his path five tenths foot 05 in height the minimum stopping sight distance is the sum of two 2 distances  one the distance traversed by a vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object for which a stop is necessary to the instant the brakes are applied  and the other the distance required to stop the vehicle after the brake application begins the minimum safe stopping sight distances for the city of keller street types are shown in table no 3 these sight distances are based on each design speed shown and on wet pavement the minimum length of crest vertical curve required for the safe stopping sight distance of each street type may be calculated using the formula l   ka and the values of k for a crest vertical curve are also shown in table no 3 table no 3 minimum length of a vertical curve crest vertical curve sag vertical curve l   ka where l   minimum length

a sag vertical curve is required the vertical curve will be of sufficient length to provide a comfortable ride during the change in vertical direction the minimum length of sag vertical curve required to provide a comfortable ride may be calculated using the formula l   ka and the values of k for a sag vertical curve are shown in table no 3  sight distance at intersections an important consideration in the design of thoroughfares is the vehicle attempting to cross the thoroughfare from the side street or drive the operator of the vehicle attempting to cross should have an unobstructed view of the whole intersection and a length of the thoroughfare to be crossed sufficient to permit control of the vehicle to avoid collisions the minimum sight distance considered safe under various assumptions of physical conditions and driver behavior is related directly to vehicle speeds and to the resultant distance traversed during perception and reaction time and during braking this sight distance which is termed intersection sight distance can be calculated for different thoroughfares and for various grades upwards and downward intersection sight distances are shown
