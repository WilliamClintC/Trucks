communities in their early history while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of incorporation subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for more and detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the town the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records they must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the town ordered the following codification contents of various chapters of the currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the town of jaffrey each piece of legislation has been included as a separate chapter or renumbered and stylized consistent with the style of the without any substantive change division of divided into parts administrative legislation contains town legislation of an administrative nature namely that dealing with the administration of government that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments general legislation contains other town legislation of a regulatory nature legislation in this part generally imposes penalties for violation of its provisions whereas that in does not grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the legislation is organized into chapters the order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more pieces of legislation dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all legislation dealing with sewers may be found in in sewers while all legislation pertaining to taxation may be found in in taxation in such chapters use of has preserved the identity of the individual pieces of legislation table of contents the table of contents details the arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more pieces of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual pieces of legislation reserve chapters space has been provided for the convenient insertion alphabetically of later enactments in the table of contents such space appears as chapters titled reserved in the body of the reserved space is provided by breaks in the pagenumbering sequence between chapters pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit one hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals ol thus begins on  on  etc by use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every piece of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of is  291 while the fifth section of is  1475 scheme the scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text histories at the end of the scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived including the date of adoption in the case of chapters containing articles derived from more than one piece of legislation the source of each indicated in the history because as in many older municipalities early records are often incomplete or imprecise some of the legislation included in the the town of jaffrey lacks verifiable adoption dates early records of the board of selectmen occasionally make no reference to a date of adoption in most cases enactments of the board of selectmen bear effective dates which are also the date of adoption  however this relationship of dates can not always be verified in some cases the enactments bear only the dates or which the enactments were recorded while it is clear that all of these enactments were adopted as the selectmen signed them to indicate their acceptance the official date of adoption could not be determined in such instances the history reflects these circumstances by indicating that the legislation in question was approved by the board of selectmen and also provides the effective date or date of recording of such legislation for simplicity and clarity in section histories the following abbreviations for legislating bodies have been used atm annual town meeting stm special town meeting general references  editors notes in each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the a table of general references is included to direct the readers attention to such related chapters editors notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information and cross references to related provisions in other chapters appendix certain forms of local legislation do not fall into the categories established for parts i and ii of the but are of such significance that their application is communitywide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government the appendix of this reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include index the index is a guide to information since it is likely that this be used by persons without formal legal training the index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly each section of each chapter has been indexed the index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the supplementation of the follow the adoption of new legislation new legislation and amendments will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after passage supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old pages removed in accordance with the instruction page which accompanies

as a permit limitation for the specific discharge if an industrial user proposes to discharge at concentrations greater than the concentrationbased screening level maintained by the town then the industrial user may be required to conduct the evaluations described in the previous paragraph should the evaluations support an alternate sitespecific limitation then the screening level may at the discretion of the director be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge c best management practices the town may

purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c below are met c a user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 at the time of the upset the facility was being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the director within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submittal must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c action being implemented andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance d in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof e users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards f a user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails jaffrey municipal sewer use ordinance prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in paragraph 26a of this the specific prohibitions in paragraph 26b of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the town was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements bypass a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c the user shall provide the following notifications for bypass events 1 if a user is aware in advance of the need for a bypass the user shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass a written submittal shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submittal shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps implemented or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the director may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d bypass is prohibited and the director may initiate enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless jaffrey municipal sewer use ordinance 1 the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section e the director may approve an anticipated bypass subsequent to considering its adverse effects if the director determines that it will satisfy the three conditions listed in paragraph d of this section article xii  septage disposal rsa 485a or revisions thereto of the state

manpower fulltime public works employees including water division employees assist the highway department with winter road maintenance in addition several contractors as deemed necessary by the director or designee are contracted with seasonally to assist this includes the contract operator of the wastewater treatment facility  1717 materials the department anticipates using approximately 2000 tons of salt and 750900 cubic yards of sand each season salt is typically obtained from supplier utilizing the nhdot bid pricing annual contract locally procured sand is used as an abrasive for dirt roads and is applied to improve the publics motor vehicle traction on paved roads salt is deposited by mechanical spreader in the middle of the road where traffic allows creating a liquid super salt brine effect depending upon the type of treatment required for road conditions the salt may be broadcast over the travel way to deice department may also employ additional antiicing compounds such as calcium chloride at the beginning of each winter season it is the goal of the department to begin the season with a full salt shed as material is used salt is ordered to keep the shed stocked unless weather conditions require a different approach winter maintenance routes are usually treated first with salt if a mixture of sand and salt is used the ratio used is approximately 2 parts sand to 1 salt the salt is applied as close to the center of the roadway as possible where traffic can work the mix traveling either way this sometimes requires spreading the material the mixture in conjunction with traffic action creates a watery brine melting snow and  or ice and resists snow and ice packing on the roadway the road crown further assists with the spreading of the mixture brine depending on temperatures and other weather conditions the public works director or his designee will make the determination as to when to stop applying salt and change to other add materials that are available for use at the time the following roads or sections thereof are designated no or reduced salt zones and may be treated with salt alternatives o gilmore pond road o squantum road gravel roads receive no antiicing materials sand is spread on these roads as an abrasive 17103  1718 streets and sidewalks  17111 1718 communications the public works rolling stock is equipped with twoway radios

distinction between a special exception and a variance a special exception can be defined as a stated exception to the ordinance if certain terms and conditions are met while a variance is a provision for nonenforcement of the ordinance as it may apply under special circumstances to a particular piece of land which special circumstances have not been specifically provided for in the wording of the ordinance 102 unless otherwise specifically provided the board of adjustment shall before granting a special exception rsa  find that in their judgment all of the following conditions are met  the specific site is an appropriate location for such a use structure or condition   the use structure or activity will not be detrimental to the neighborhood nor significantly alter the characteristics of the district   adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the proper operation of the proposed use  and  such exception if granted will not adversely affect any other district or portion thereof  special exceptions authorized by the board of adjustment shall be valid if exercised within 2 years from the date of final approval or as further extended by the board for good cause provided that no such special exception shall expire within 6 months after the resolution of a planning application filed in reliance upon the special exception 2016 103 the power to grant variances stems from rsa  all of the following conditions must be found by the board of adjustment before they can grant a variance  2017  the variance will not be contrary to the public interest  the variance is consistent with the spirit of the ordinance  substantial justice is done  the value of surrounding properties will not be diminished  and  literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship a for purposes of this subparagraph unnecessary hardship means that owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area i no fair and substantial relationship exists between the general public purposes of the ordinance provision and the specific application of that provision to the property  and ii the proposed use is a reasonable one b if the criteria in subparagraph a are not established an unnecessary hardship will be deemed to exist if and only if owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area the property cannot be reasonably used in strict conformance with the ordinance and a variance is therefore necessary to enable a reasonable use of it the definition of unnecessary hardship set forth in paragraph  shall apply whether the provision of the ordinance from which a variance is sought is a restriction on use a dimensional or other limitation on a permitted use or any other requirement of the ordinance 2017  variances authorized by the board of adjustment shall be valid if exercised within 2 years from the date of final approval or as further extended by the board for good cause provided that no such variance shall expire within 6 months after the resolution of a planning application filed in reliance upon the special exception 2017 amendment 111 ordinances embodied in the jaffrey land use be amended by a majority vote at town meeting when such amendment is published in the warrant calling for the meeting and when

wetlands surface waters water supply floodplain or aquifer protection areas f the stormwater management system design shall follow the new hampshire stormwater manual volumes iiii nh department of environmental services 2008 as may be revised from time to time aka the stormwater manual criteria relative to noise noise criteria definition words and phrases used herein are defined as follows in accordance with american standard s1 11960 entitled acoustical terminology a band level a band level is the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using the a weighting network the unit of measurement is the dba decibel decibel is onetenth root of ten 10 and the quantities concerned are proportional to power frequency frequency is measured in the number of sound vibrations in one second leq the sound pressure level spl which if integrated over a specific time period interval would result in the same energy as a variable spl integrated over the same period sound analyzer a sound analyzer is a device for measuring the band pressure level or pressure spectrum level of a sound as a function of frequency sound level meter a soundlevel meter is an instrument including a microphone an amplifier and output meter and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner sound pressure level a sound pressure level in decibels of sound is twenty 20 times the logarithm to the base ten 10 of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure which reference pressure must explicitly state noise measurement the measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting the standards prescribed by ansi s141971 type 1 and iec 179 the instruments shall be maintained in calibration and good working order octave band corrections may be employed in meeting the response specifications a calibration check shall be made of the system at the time of any noise measurement measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source the microphone during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement of diminution of the measured noise a windscreen for the microphone shall be used when required traffic aircraft and other transportation noise sources and other background noises shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured the slow meter response of the sound level shall be used in order to best determine that the average amplitude has not exceeded the limiting noise spectra set forth the measurement shall be made at the nearest edge of the residential zoned district on which such noise is perceived as appropriate four feet above ground in the case of an elevated or directional sound or noise source compliance with the noise limits is to be maintained at any elevation at the boundary spls will be measured in the a weighted decibel scale dba the leq shall be employed when spl are measured over a period of time rather than individual spl measurements taken at fixed points in time to assess noise impact the leq will be integrated over a specific time period interval the leq will be measured over a 2 hour 4 hour or 24hour period at the nearest edge of the residential zoned district application of noise control methods consideration will be given to the application of noise control methods that may be applied to control noise emission sources at the point of generation that are by their very nature noisy eg generators high velocityflow pumps air conditioning units etc as a means to achieve the maximum sound pressure limits as noted in the ordinance architectural designed and constructed wallsbarriers and acoustical enclosures are sound reduction methods which can result in reducing the sound as the energy passes material as a transmission loss tl a barrier wall or other equal means constructed of concrete stone rock or a composite material capable of reducing the spl to acceptable limits as specified in this ordinance are encouraged noise limits the jaffrey site plan regulations limit daytime and nighttime noise that is continuous regular or a frequent source of sound during the daytime a maximum sound pressure limit of 60 dba measured at the nearest edge of the residential zoning district is allowed during the nighttime a maximum sound pressure limit of 50 dba measured at the nearest edge of the residential zoning district is allowed the sound is measured at a height of four feet these standards may be enhanced by adjusting the decibel level limit to sounds that are not continuous and smooth as follows a noise source operated at less than 20% of any one hour period  plus 5 to limit b noise source operated at less than 5% of any one hour period  plus 10 to limit c noise source operated at less than 1% of any one hour period  plus 15 to limit d impulsiverepeating noise character during any one hour period eg  hammering minus 5 to limit noise from safety alarmssignals warning devices excluding standard backup signals on equipment emergency pressure relief valves emergency vehicles emergency work to protect persons or property construction noise between the hours of  am and  pm on weekdays and  am and  pm on weekends and holidays and unamplified human voices shall be exempt from these standards wellhead protection in any areas designated by the town of jaffrey as groundwater protection
