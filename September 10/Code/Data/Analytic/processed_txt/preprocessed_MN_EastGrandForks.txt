neighborhoods located within close proximity to sexually oriented businesses experience the following negative impacts a increased crime rates particularly in sexrelated crimes such as rapes prostitution indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  b property values which are either diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties not located in proximity to sexually oriented businesses  c increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  d deteriorated neighborhood appearance from litter and graffiti  e sexrelated harassment of residents and customers by motorists and pedestrians  f a perception that the area is unsafe  and g difficulty in attracting and retaining customers employees and desirable tenants 3 the adverse impacts which sexually oriented businesses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexually oriented business increases 2010 s1 building regulations 14i 4 the adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses are exacerbated when the uses are located near each other 5 the presence of liquor establishments in the immediate vicinity of sexually oriented businesses also compounds the adverse impacts on the neighborhood 6 sexually oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending day care centers or schools and people using public parks and libraries 7 sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area where they are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents 8 the concentration of sexually oriented businesses in 1 area can have a substantially detrimental effect on that area and on the overall quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexually oriented businesses the presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area the resulting decline in real estate values erodes the citys tax base and contributes to overall urban blight 9 land use regulations are appropriate to minimize the detrimental effects that sexually oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses b when no zoning regulations adopted if the city has not adopted zoning regulations for sexually oriented businesses as defined this code then a sexually oriented business may locate only in those areas of the city which the city council determines that the predominant use of the land is for commercial or industrial purposes c not to operate

east grand forks  and whereas the citys comprehensive plan zoning licensing and development regulations may not adequately address various impacts to the public health safety morals and general welfare that adult uses and sexually oriented businesses present  and whereas to provide for adequate time for study analysis and the finalization of a city code amendments regarding sexually oriented businesses and to preserve the status quo within the city the city desires to enact temporary location requirements and a temporary prohibition on the applications for and the issuance of permits and licenses of sexually oriented businesses the city of east grand forks ordains as follows the following moratorium ordinance is adopted purpose 11 the purpose of this interim ordinance is to protect the planning process and the health safety and welfare of the citizens of east grand forks by placing temporary location requirements on adult uses within the city the ordinance will allow adult uses

these studies concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on surrounding neighborhoods those impacts include increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks the city council of the city of east grand forks recognizes that the same or similar adverse impacts could occur in a smaller city therefore the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult establishments be295271 419932v3 mdt be295271 2 a adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is

have such uses  f studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable
