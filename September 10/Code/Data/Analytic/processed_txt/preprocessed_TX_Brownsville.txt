service large demand gsld or large industrial service lis rates and who have requested aggregation of electric service billing aggregate billing involves a customer with multiple metering points at more than one location the demand kilowatts and energy kilowatts per hour for each service point are metered separately and totaled for all locations on a coincident basis the billing kilowatts will be the maximum 15minute measured coincident demand for all locations the billing kilowatts per hour will be the sum of kilowatts per hour metered at each location aggregate billing applies only to the billing kilowatts and kilowatts per hour and the resulting charges it does not apply to customer charges which are imposed at each meter location under this method the customer pays a customer charge applicable for each location as opposed to the multiple customer charges paid under summary billing by aggregating demands the customers demand billing units will likely result in a lower total demand reflecting the diversity between the several metered locations and therefore a lower demand charge will result b metering application of the aggregation to billing procedures will require certain
