sexual orientations it is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official municipal agent municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender all municipal officials municipal agents municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof exh a 1218 definition of sexual harassment this policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the illinois human rights act which currently defines sexual harassment as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when 1 submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individuals employment  2 submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual  or 3 such conduct has the purpose or

stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication email textpicturevideo messages intranetonline postings blogs instant messages and social network websites like facebook and twitter the most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine on the other end of the spectrum some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends to some extent on individual perception and interpretation the courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a reasonable person exh a 1218 procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment an employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herselfhimself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incidents as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating herhis position to the offending employee and herhis immediate supervisor it is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment including the following  electronicdirect communication if there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace the harassed employee should directly and clearly express herhis objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop the initial message may be verbal if subsequent messages are needed they should be put in writing in
