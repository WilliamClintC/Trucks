nebraska  zoning ordinance  2013 92 fpfw floodplainfloodway district  statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 194 has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area therefore the city council of the city of fairbury nebraska ordains as follows 2 findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city of fairbury nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this ordinance it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in 2 a by applying the provisions of this ordinance to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program article 6 conditional use permits fairbury nebraska  zoning ordinance  2013 93  general provisions 1 lands to which this ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of fairbury nebraska identified on the flood insurance rate map firm and flood insurance study fis dated  and any revisions thereto as numbered and unnumbered a zones including ae ao and ah zones and within the zoning districts fw and ff established in this ordinance in all areas covered by this ordinance no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in  2 the enforcement officer the zoning administrator of the community is hereby designated as the communitys duly designated enforcement officer under this rules for interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board of adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires 4 compliance within identified special flood hazard areas of this community no development shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations 5 abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this ordinance to repeal abrogate or impair any existent easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions the provision of this ordinance shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only 6 interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes 7 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this ordinance does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage this ordinance shall not create liability on the part of city of fairbury nebraska or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder 8 severability article 6 conditional use permits fairbury nebraska  zoning ordinance  2013 94 if any section clause provision or portion of this
