vermont additionally the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost to provide coverage and capacity comparable to that of the proposed facility 2 the proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usefulness of other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the state of vermont and such interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost 3 the proposed antennas and equipment alone or together with existing facilities equipment or antennas would create rfi in violation of federal standards or requirements 4 the proposed antennas and equipment either alone or

nonregulatory voluntary guideline  it will not be used to evaluate a proposed sign signs in historic districts there are many areas in waterbury with structures of historical andor architectural significance including four designated historic districts these historic districts are also consistent with original village settlements which remain characterized by mixed uses and a pedestrian orientation signage in these areas should complement the character of the area and the structure it relates to sign types the choice of sign should depend upon the surroundings and the attention one desires to attract an abundance of signs of many different sizes shapes and heights in the same area can be visually chaotic and ineffective as they compete for the attention of the viewer particularly in business districts signs with similar materials lighting and styles of support can provide a unifying element to a village or business district and enhance the area for business figure
