call 911 and ask for the oncall fire marshal clevels of response 1five levels of water shortage response are outlined in the table below the five levels of water shortage response are voluntary reductions mandatory reductions i and ii emergency reductions and water rationing a detailed description of each response level and corresponding water reduction measures follow below  stage response description 1 voluntary reductions water users are encouraged to reduce their water use and improve water use efficiency  however no penalties apply for noncompliance water supply conditions indicate a potential for shortage see below 2 mandatory reductions i water users must abide required water use reduction and efficiency measures  penalties apply for noncompliance water supply conditions are significantly lower than the seasonal norm and water shortage conditions are expected to persist see below 3 mandatory reductions ii same as in stage 2 description plus see below 4 emergency reductions water supply conditions are substantially diminished and pose an imminent threat to human health or environmental integrity see below 5 water rationing water supply conditions are substantially diminished and remaining supplies must be allocated to preserve human health and environmental integrity see below  2in stage 1 voluntary reductions all water users will be asked to reduce their normal water use by 5% customer education and outreach programs will encourage water conservation and efficiency measures including irrigating landscapes a maximum of one inch per week  preventing water waste runoff and watering impervious surfaces  watering plants deeply to encourage root growth  washing only full loads in clothes and dishwashers  using springloaded nozzles on garden hoses  and identifying and repairing all water leaks 3in stage 2 mandatory reductions i all customers are expected to reduce their water use by 10% in comparison to their previous months water bill in addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions the following restrictions apply irrigation is limited to a half inch per week between  pm and  am  outdoor use drinking water for washing impervious surfaces is prohibited  and all testing and training purposes requiring drinking water such as fire protection will be limited 4in stage 3 mandatory reductions ii customers must continue actions from all previous stages and further reduce water use by 20% compared to their previous months water bill all nonessential uses of drinking water are banned and garden and landscape irrigation must be reduced to the minimum amount necessary for survival additionally in stage 3 a drought surcharge of 15 times the normal water rate applies 5in stage 4 emergency reductions customers must continue all actions from previous stages and further reduce their water use by 25% compared to their previous months water bill a ban on all use of drinking water except to protect public health and safety is implemented and drought surcharges increase to two times the normal water rate 6the goal of stage 5 water rationing is to provide drinking water to protect public health such as residences residential health care facilities and correctional facilities in stage 5 all customers are only permitted to use water at the minimum required for public health protection firefighting is the only allowable outdoor water use and pickup locations for distributing potable water will be announced according to town emergency response plan drought surcharges increase to five times the normal water rate dtriggers the town purchases the water from the county public utilities the town will follow the counties protocols for their water shortage and water rationing responses the town will also stay in close contact with all county agencies this plan will enact the town to mandate their own water restrictions due to nature and manmade disasters examples include main water line breaks loss of system pressure hurricanes tornadoes and the like ereturn to normal when water shortage conditions have abated and the situation is returning to normal water conservation measures employed during each phase should be decreased in reverse order of implementation permanent measures directed toward longterm monitoring and conservations should be implemented or continued so that the community will be in a better position to prevent shortages and respond to recurring water shortage conditions fenforcement the provisions of the water shortage response plan will be enforced by town utility department and police personnel violators will be reported to the town for record keeping and enforcement actions citations are assessed according to the following schedule depending on the number of prior violations and current level of water shortage  water shortage level first violation second violation third violation voluntary reductions na na na mandatory reductions stages 2 and 3 warning $250 discontinuation of service emergency reductions $250 discontinuation of service discontinuation of service water rationing $500 discontinuation of service discontinuation of service drought surcharge rates are effective in stages 3 4 and 5  gpublic comment customers will have multiple opportunities to comment on the provisions of the water shortage response plan first a notice will be published in the daily record informing citizens of the draft plan a draft plan will be available at the town hall administration building and on the town website allowing citizens to comment on the draft second a public hearing will be scheduled with notice printed in the daily record all subsequent revisions to the draft plan will be published at least 30 days prior to an adoption vote by town council hvariance protocols applications for water use variance requests are available from the town website and town hall all applications must be submitted to the town hall for review a decision to approve or deny individual variance requests will be determined within two weeks of submittal after careful consideration of the following criteria impact on water demand expected duration alternative source options social and economic importance purpose such as necessary use of drinking water and the prevention of structural damage ieffectiveness the effectiveness of the water shortage response plan will be determined by comparing the stated water conservation goals with observed water use reduction data other factors to be considered include frequency of plan activation any problem periods without activation total number of violation citations desired reductions attained and evaluation of demand reductions compared to the previous years seasonal data jrevision the water shortage response plan will be reviewed and revised as needed to adapt to new circumstances affecting water supply and demand following implementation of emergency restrictions and at a minimum of every five years in conjunction with the updating of our local water supply plan further a water shortage response planning work group will review procedures following each emergency or rationing stage to recommend any necessary improvements to the plan to town council the utility director is responsible for initiating all subsequent revisions passed 2122013  5199 penalty aany violation of any

should be compatible with the established architectural character of the town by using a design that is complementary to existing town architectural styles designs and forms as a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate well into the context of the town this article has identified five key features necessary to ensure compatibility  a street frontage along residential side streets limit interruptions to front setback landscaping a key way of achieving this is by preserving existing front yard landscaping and minimizing the amount of frontage devoted to paved vehicle areas b rhythm of development along street continue established building rhythms along street frontages avoid monolithic massing that disrupts finegrain neighborhood or mixeduse corridor pattern c building frontages i along street frontages orient windows main entrances and other primary building faade elements toward the street ii care should be taken to avoid the appearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street courtyard buildings can contribute to this by orienting main entrances toward courtyards that serve as a semipublic extension of the public realm of adjacent streets d front setback patterns continue established building setback patterns where this is a neighborhood priority and is practical e use of landscaping & trees use landscaping

athe requirements set forth in this article concerning the amount size location and nature of open space to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the board of commissioners as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of open space that is consistent with officially adopted town plans the board of commissioners recognizes however that due to the particular nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the permit issuing authority is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that 1the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and 2because of peculiarities in the applicants tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards bwhenever the permit issuing authority approves a deviation from these open space standards pursuant to paragraph a the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation open space linkages where a trail natural area or public park is dedicated to or

enhancement of the towns aesthetic integrity and architectural character  support tourism and stimulate local economic development preserve private property values  and maintain a high quality of life throughout the town the town desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a good neighbor to its surroundings and the town believes that welldesigned and wellmaintained developments is in the best interests of all residents and businesses applicability awhile this section provides specific standards for development it cannot and is not intended to cover all circumstances rather the structure and content of the manual are meant to give developers and reviewers the perspective to address the unique conditions of each project while giving builders the flexibility to develop their own designs that meet the intent principles and spirit of the guidelines bthe building design review process as outline in this ordinance shall apply to the following 1new development all new construction shall conform to the requirements of this section 2renovation and expansions to existing development if the total repairs andor renovations to an existing building within a fiveyear period enlarge the footprint 50% or more or collectively cost more than 50% of the tax value as recorded in the county tax record at the date of application such development shall be required to meet the minimum requirements set forth to the fullest extent technically feasible 3maintenance and changes maintenance and changes to exterior existing building elements and faades for development less than 50% of tax value will apply only to the specific change approved site plans may not be further modified before or after construction installation or occupancy without review and approval of the administrator the passage of time shall not remove this requirement for review and approval if changes in design including color are proposed for any building built prior to or after the adoption of this chapter within the town which is subject to these provisions 4multifamily & residential facilities all multifamily developments and other residential facilities are subject to these regulations single family dwellings attached & detached and duplexes subject to regulation under the north carolina residential one and two family dwellings shall be exempt from these

color is an integral element of the overall design faade colors shall be of low reflectance earth tone muted subtle or neutral colors limit the number of color choices generally there is a wall color trim color accent color and roof color use natural tints of materials such as reds browns tans grays and greens as primary colors brick concrete and stone will have an inherent color created by nature or during the manufacturing process building trim may feature brighter colors but neon tubing is not allowed as an accent material the use of highintensity metallic fluorescent or neon colors shall be prohibited eroof pitch roofs with pitches less than  and flat roofs will require a parapet wall on all sides visible from a public rightofway a pitched roof shall be profiled by eaves a minimum of six inches from the building face or with a gutter parapet walls shall have decorative cornicescaps roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and visual interest and shall be articulated every 30 to 60 feet depending on the type of building see illustration to left the parapet shall be constructed so as to conceal all roofing material and equipment such as rooftop venting

other appropriate areas gcompatibility adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale height architectural style andor configuration relate setbacks of new construction to setbacks of existing buildings or developments limit setback variation to 20% of average setback of existing appropriate development on a street for both residential and nonresidential development hhuman scale  1historically buildings were built small and pedestrian scaled 2newer more recent developments are more massive with large box stores and expansive parking areas 3these developments have lost the human intimate scale 4while the footprint of new commercial development may remain large massing and organization of building forms can help to retain the human scale 5windows doors columns eaves parapets and other building components shall be proportional to the overall scale of the building windows shall be vertically proportioned wherever possible 6the primary entrance shall be both architecturally and functionally designed on the front faade of the building facing the primary street such entrances shall be designed to convey their prominence on the fronting faade iwindows except

made of cloth plastic or of a similar material such awnings or marquee shall be maintained so as not to show evidence of tearing ripping or other holes which diminish their function and cause unsightly conditions whenever an awning is removed all supporting members shall be removed within two years of adoption of this code and thereafter immediately upon removal of any awning  mcompatibility 1 compatible designs can integrate diverse land uses and help make the community have a cohesive atmosphere compatible does not have to mean the same in fact the blandness that would result would be undesirable in its own way the focus should be on maintaining a humanscale and mitigating any features that might be offensive to neighbors establish a design theme to give a distinctive character to a specific activity center such as business parks and shopping center that have a palette of materials forms and features  create a coordinated but inviting mix of buildings and spaces  and establish a unique identity for each activity center give importance to maintaining similar quality of construction and materials scale height width roof form setback and layout not exactly the same style a coordinated palette of colors should be created for each development this palette should be compatible with adjacent developments 2the theme for this development includes decorative shingles on steeply pitched roofs with wall dormers and brick with cast stone details  naccessory buildings and devices building and devices that are ancillary to the primary building such as loading trash containment maintenance storage and mechanicalelectrical areas and the devices and equipment associated with these areas shall be incorporated in the overall design architecture and landscape so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions and devices are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public areas all accessory structures shall be constructed of the same materials and colors as used for the main building oconnectivity 1generally a community is made up of both social and physical connections connecting uses means making clear pedestrian and vehicular pathways between developments it also means intermingling compatible uses a strong sense of community the highly valued small town atmosphere depends on having such convenient and easy access to a variety of activities and uses this connection of uses is very important to the function of a livable pedestrianoriented community such as the town desires because many policies of recent decades have resulted in or even required the separation of projects and uses this allimportant design principle perhaps will require the greatest adjustment in how development occurs 2connectivity requirements aindividual developments shall be joined together with roads and continuous sidewalks and paths versus a collection of separate development pods within a development easytouse internal circulation is provided not only for cars but for pedestrians and bicyclists between all buildings and spaces bbuildings shall be oriented to roads and sidewalks with orientation to

be provided for pedestrians pedestrian connections shall be made to large office developments from a nearby hotel design sidewalks appropriately for the site and the expected amount of foot traffic in commercial areas where foot traffic is expected sidewalks should be a minimum of ten feet sidewalks in residential areas can be four feet all pathways including but not limited to sidewalks and crosswalks shall meet the minimum american with disabilities act ada requirements preducing parking impacts 1generally a key principle of the towns design vision is to reduce the visual impact of parking this goal includes reducing the image of the sea of parking one finds along corridors at retail centers and the garagescape in neighborhoods parking is necessary at work at home and at destinations throughout the town however there is no reason why it needs to dominate the view 2parking lot standards aa minimum of 20 to 40% of the required parking is placed to the side or rear of development projects reducing large expanses of parking in front of developments this parking is essentially overflow parking for peak usage during the year buildings shall be more prominent than parking lots  bparking areas including drives and accessways shall be surfaced with either asphalt or concrete cdriveshall be accessed at the building faade facing the rear property line away from the pedestrian streetrightofway donstreet parking is provided when feasible to reduce the area of parking lots quse of alternate plan material or methods 1alternate design plans building materials or construction techniques may be used when unreasonable or impractical situations would result from the application of architectural design standards such situations may result from unique site conditions innovative design applications andor unified development design the application for alternate design shall include which specific standards cannot be met and how the alternative methods will achieve the intent of the standards the performance building design alternatives shall be evaluated by the board of commissioners to determine if the alternate design meets the intent and purpose of this article 2this determination shall take into account the land use of adjacent property the orientation of the building to public streets the building typology the intended use of the structure

space minimum area for a cluster subdivision the minimum area for a cluster subdivision is 25 acres minimum open space dedication the minimum amount of preserved open space that must be dedicated and permanently protected within a cluster subdivision is 20% of the gross acreage of the proposed subdivision maximum number of lots & lot sizes athe maximum number of lots shall not exceed that of the base zoning andor the maximum density for properties located in the critical area of the cape fear water supply watershed as outlined in this ordinance bminimum lot sizes are not applicable to single family cluster subdivision projects minimum lot frontage and building setbacks the minimum lot frontage and building setback requirements of the underlying zoning district may be reduced by up to 25% within a cluster subdivision in exchange for the dedication of additional land for natural open space preservation the lot width and building setback requirements may be reduced by an additional 1% for each additional 2% of the gross acreage of the project that is dedicated for natural open space preservation in no case shall the lot width or building setback requirements be reduced below 40% of

is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a developments traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure it is an essential part of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving various development reviews the tia helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety traffic and transportation operations and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts ultimately the tia can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development is

established for lands within the watersheds of existing drinking water rivers these districts overlay other zoning districts established in delineated on the official zoning map wherever standards of the underlying zoning district differ from the watershed overlay standards the more restrictive provisions shall apply exceptions to applicability anothing contained herein shall repeal modify or amend any federal or state law or regulation or any ordinance or regulation pertaining thereto except any ordinance which these regulations specifically replace  nor shall any provision of this ordinance amend modify or restrict any provision of the lillington unified development   however the adoption of this section shall and does amend any and all ordinances resolutions and regulations in effect in lillington at the time of the adoption of this ordinance that may be construed to impair or reduce the effectiveness of this ordinance or to conflict with any of its provisions bit is not intended that these regulations interfere with any easement covenants or other agreements between parties however if the provisions of these regulations impose greater restrictions or higher standards for the use of a building or land then the provisions of these regulations shall control cexisting development as defined in this ordinance is not subject to the requirements of this ordinance

density calculations dif a nonconforming lot of record is not contiguous to any other lot owned by the same party then that lot of record shall not be subject to the development restrictions of this ordinance if it is developed for singlefamily residential purposes purpose and intent athe purpose of the watershed protection overlay districts is to prevent significant future water quality deterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive stormwater runoff from land within the town protection of all water supplies within the state in accordance with minimum standards was mandated by the water supply watershed protection act passed by the general assembly in 1989 the quality of water in drinking water reservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming obstruction of highways and roads subdivision development industrial development and other land disturbing activities types of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment bacterial contamination heavy metals synthetic organic compounds and lowlevel radioactivity bthe intent of the watershed protection overlay districts is to apply a set of regulations involving land use and in some cases structural best management practices bmps that protect the watersheds by reducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies land use management practices involve minimum lot sizes maximum allowed density and builtupon area restrictions since builtupon areas such as roads rooftops and driveways are a major source of pollution structural best management practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for temporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle establishment of area athe watershed protection overlay districts as hereby established overlay other zoning districts established in this chapter the new use of any land or new structure within any watershed protection overlay district shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning district as well as the requirements of the applicable watershed protection overlay district ba
