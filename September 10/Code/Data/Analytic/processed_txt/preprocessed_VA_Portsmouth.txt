localities by virginia  101600 et seq b findings of fact the flood hazard areas of portsmouth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages trends in tide data over the last 100 years suggest that portsmouth is facing an increased danger of flooding caused by both sea level rise and subsidence the data also suggest that portsmouth may experience a rise in base flood elevations greater than four feet in the next 100 years c statement of purpose the purpose of these provisions is to reduce the loss of life and property  to reduce the creation of health and safety hazards  to reduce the disruption of commerce and governmental services  to reduce the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief  and to reduce the impairment of the tax base by 1 regulating uses activities and development which alone or in combination with other existing or future uses activities and development will cause damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights velocities and frequencies 2 restricting or prohibiting certain uses activities and development from locating within districts subject to flooding 3 requiring all those uses activities and developments that do occur in floodprone districts to be protected andor floodproofed against flooding and flood damage 4 protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for

methods of study but does not imply total flood protection larger floods may occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as excessive rainfall ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or that land use within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages c the

lists land uses and indicates whether they are allowed by right or with a use permit in a base zoning district allowed in an activity center zoning district or prohibited in a base zoning district and activity center zoning district the use table also includes references to any additional requirements or regulations applicable to the specific use type 2 organization of uses the use table organizes allowable uses by use classifications use categories and use types the use table and use classifications categories and use types together provide a systematic basis for identifying and consolidating or distinguishing unidentified land uses to determine whether a particular land use is allowable in a particular zoning district and in addressing future land uses a use classifications the use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include residential uses public and institutional uses commercial uses and industrial uses use classifications are further broken down into a series of general use categories and specific use types b use categories the use categories describe the major subgroups of the respective use classifications and are based on common functional product or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions for example the residential use classification is divided into the household living and group living use categories use categories are further broken down into a series of individual use types c use types the specific use types are included in the respective use category they identify the specific principal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category for example livework dwellings singlefamily detached dwellings twotofour family dwellings townhouse dwellings and multifamily dwellings are use types in the household living use category 3 permitted uses a p in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed by right in the corresponding base zoning district subject to compliance with any usespecific standards referenced in the final column of the use table an a is used in the columns for the activity center districts and specifies the allowable use types in a particular activity center district provided the use type is set out in an approved activity center master plan permitted uses are subject to all other applicable requirements of this including those set forth in  development standards 4 uses allowed only with a use permit a u in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed in the corresponding base zoning district only upon approval of a use permit in accordance with b use permit and any usespecific standards referenced in the final column of the use table uses subject to a use permit are subject to all other applicable requirements of this including those set forth in  development standards 5 allowed uses subject to a activity center district classification an a in a cell indicates that a use category or use type is allowed by right in an activity center district subject to compliance with the usespecific regulations set forth in the final column of the table and provided the use is set out as a possible use type in an approved activity center master plan allowed uses are subject to other applicable regulations in this including those set forth in activity center zoning districts use types that are blank are not allowable in a particular activity center district and shall not be included in a master plan 6 prohibited uses a blank cell or a slash in the use table indicates that the use type is prohibited in the corresponding zoning district 7 usespecific standards when a particular use category or use type is permitted in a zoning district there may be additional regulations that are applicable to a specific use the existence of these usespecific standards is noted section reference in the last column of the use table titled additional requirements references refer to usespecific standards these standards shall apply to a particular use regardless of the base zoning district where it is proposed unless otherwise specified 8 use restricted or prohibited by overlay zoning district regardless of whether the use table identifies a particular use type as a permitted use allowed use or use requiring a use permit in a zoning district or references additional requirements for the use type the use type may be restricted or prohibited or subject to more restrictive additional requirements in accordance with applicable overlay district provisions in overlay zoning districts 9 unlisted uses the planning director shall determine whether or not an unlisted use is part of an existing use category or use type defined in use classifications categories and types or is substantially similar to an already defined use type using the standards in a4 interpretation of unlisted uses 10 uses in the downtown d1 and d2 districts the use standards related to the downtown d1 and d2 districts are included with the districtspecific standards for each district in appendix a and b respectively of this 11 uses in the residential mobile home rmh district the rmh district is included as appendix c

determine how a particular land use activity or combination of activities is to be considered in applying the use table and other provisions in this section is also intended to provide support in identifying instances where a new or unanticipated land use not identified in the use table is of such a nature function or duration that the impact of allowing it in a particular zoning district is so similar to that of a use type already identified in the use table as allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated land use should be interpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district and the use regulations 2 structure of this a general this section identifies each of the four use classifications in table 40141a use table and includes a section under each use classification identifying each use category there are characteristics and examples subsections under each use category individual use types are defined in  definitions b principal use

facilities  and xiv the impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type which should not be greater than that of other use types allowed in the zoning district c effect of approval of unlisted use i after interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district the zoning administrator shall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently or whether its omission from the use table is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion on determining that the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if

enhance the aesthetic environment and the citys ability to attract sources of economic development and growth  to improve pedestrian and traffic safety to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions 1 findings the city council finds a signs provide a vital function for the convenience of the public and for the efficient communication of commercial and noncommercial speech b unlike oral speech signs may cause harm by virtue of the physical space they occupy by obstructing views distracting motorists displacing alternative uses of land and endangering the safety of persons or property the city has a substantial and compelling interest in all of the purposes set forth below and has a substantial and compelling interest in regulating signs in such a way that the harms caused by signs might be reduced and mitigated c signs are essential to the health and economic wellbeing of the city by i facilitating consumer transactions and other commercial and industrial activities that allow businesses to be successful which in turn provides employment and supports a stable tax base  and ii providing information and directions for the safe and efficient travel of motor vehicles bicycles and pedestrians d signs have a strong visual impact on the character and aesthetic appearance of the city i they are a prominent part of the cityscape and as such can enhance or detract from the citys image and character and facilitate or impede the creation of an attractive and harmonious environment in the city ii their suitability or appropriateness helps to define the way in which the city and neighborhoods within the city are perceived e the visual environment and character of the city are important factors in the citys economic wellbeing because they influence portsmouths appearance and land values f the visual environment and character of the city as well as the orderly flow of traffic and safety of travel are diminished when visual clutter results and the vision of motorists bicyclists and pedestrians is obstructed by the unrestricted proliferation and placement of signs or from the improper maintenance of signs g regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs throughout the city is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment to provide ample meaningful opportunities for persons who desire to display information by means of a sign to have their information seen and understood and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising and other messages for the benefit of all persons in the city h for these reasons the needs of individual citizens property owners and businesses to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages must be balanced against the goals of the city to ensure the safety of its roads and pedestrianways maintain its desired character and preserve and enhance the property values of property owners and businesses the provisions of this do not entirely eliminate all of the harm that may be created by the installation and display of signs instead they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harm caused by signs i the provisions of this do not apply to every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed within the city they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth below j the provisions of this are neither intended nor designed to restrict or control signs for the purpose of promoting or stifling any messages and content that might appear on them 2 purpose the purpose of this is to a promote and protect the public health safety and welfare of those within the city  b promote the efficient use of signs as a means of communication  c ensure that the right to free speech is protected  d maintain and enhance a visual environment that allows the city to attract sources of economic development and supports the economic wellbeing of the citys businesses  e protect and enhance the character quality and viability of the citys development and neighborhoods  f protect scenic views and avoid sign clutter  g reduce the distractions obstructions and hazards to pedestrian bicycle and automobile traffic caused by the excessive number size height illumination movement indiscriminate placement overconcentration or unsafe construction or maintenance of signs  h reasonably accommodate

compliance with the standards of this part of remodeling or expansion of a building or structure 2 it is not the intent of this section to allow multiple incremental improvements to a nonconforming site without addressing the nonconformities as required in this section b applicability 1 for purposes of this section the term nonconforming site features includes the following a nonconforming offstreet parking  b nonconforming landscaping  c nonconforming screening of mechanical equipment  and d nonconforming screening walls or fences 2 if an application is filed for a building permit for the remodeling or expansion of a building or site that has one or more nonconforming site features identified in b applicability and the value of the proposed improvements over a fiveyear period exceeds at least 25 percent of the assessed value of the existing site over a fiveyear period the applicant shall be required to address the nonconforming site features as provided in this section 3 the planning director may develop administrative guidelines to assist in the implementation of this subsection including guidelines for the resolution of conflicts when it may not be possible for one

provided in of the uniform statewide building the purposes of these standards structural alternations only include activities that do not result in the expansion of a building 1 determining applicability for purposes of determining when site features must be brought into partial or full compliance with the standards of this the costs that constitute the assessed value of the structural alteration of a building or structure shall be as shown on the building permit application and shall include the cost of materials and labor 2 general a 25 percent or less of structure value structural alteration of a building or structure during a fiveyear period whose assessed value is 25 percent or less of the current assessed value of the building or structure shall not require any correction to nonconforming site features b more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of structure value structural alteration of a building or structure whose assessed value exceeds more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current assessed value of the structure during a fiveyear period shall require that a corresponding percentage of the site features identified in b applicability be brought into compliance until the site achieves 100 percent compliance example a nonresidential site with nonconforming offstreet parking site feature with an assessed value of $100000 is undergoing remodeling equaling $40000 40 percent of the assessed value the developer must add a corresponding number of additional required parking spaces until the site fully complies the site at the time of remodel has 10 parking spaces but the ordinance requires a minimum of 20 for the use that is proposed 10 more spaces are required for the site to be conforming the applicant would be required to provide 40 percent of the 20 spacesor 8 more parking spaces bringing the total number of spaces on the site to 18 spaces c 75 percent or more of structure value structural alteration of a building or structure during a fiveyear period whose alteration is estimated to cost 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of the building or structure shall require 100 percent compliance with the site features identified in b applicability d two or fewer additional parking spaces when two or fewer additional offstreet parking spaces are required under this subsection as a result of a redevelopment such additional offstreet parking is not required to be installed 3 physically constrained properties comply to maximum extent practicable lands that are physically constrained due to limited size topography or other environmental considerations from complying with these provisions shall comply to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the planning director e expansions expansions to buildings or structures or use areas on sites with nonconforming site features identified in b applicability shall require compliance until the site achieves 100 percent compliance for site features in accordance with this section 1 general a expansions of 15 percent or less i additions or expansions that increase a building or structure or use areas size by 15 percent or less over a fiveyear period shall not require any correction to nonconforming site features ii this provision shall not be used to allow multiple incremental smallscale increases to a structure or use area without addressing nonconforming site features b expansion between 15 and 50 percent of gross square footage over 5 years expansion in any continuous fiveyear period which results in an increase in the gross square footage of the existing building or structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period greater than 15 percent but less than 50 percent requires a corresponding percentage of the nonconforming site features identified in b applicability to be brought into compliance until the site achieves 100 percent compliance example a 25 percent increase in square footage will necessitate a 25 percent increase in the total number of parking spaces provided up to the minimum requirement existing landscaping on the site shall be retained or replaced but shall not count toward the required percentage of new landscaping c expansion of greater than 50 percent of gross square footage over 5 years expansions over any continuous fiveyear period which results in a greater than 50 percent increase of the gross square footage of the existing building or structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period that has a nonconforming site feature identified in b applicability shall require the building or site or use area to comply with the standards of this that site feature 2 physically constrained properties comply to maximum extent practicable lands that are physically constrained due to limited size topography or other environmental considerations from complying with these provisions shall comply to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the planning director 3 addition of outdoor storage area only when only outdoor storage areas are being added or increased on a site the percentage increase in outdoor operations area shall require a corresponding percentage increase in perimeter buffers and screening perimeter buffer and screening augmentation shall be located so as to achieve the
