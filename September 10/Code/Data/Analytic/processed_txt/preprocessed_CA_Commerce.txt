interest beginning with the 2010 republication municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of william camil city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with the 2010

possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code it is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title chapter article and division in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the

present difficult issues for a local law enforcement agency that is responsible for the enforcement of labor 5 such determinations may be impacted by current law and authorities building codes architectural and other technological advancements the determination of whether a space is an enclosed space therefore may not always be easily made by the local law enforcement agency the director of public works and development services director addresses building code issues on a daily basis and is technically capable of making such determinations it is not however within the directors purview to determine what constitutes a place of employment under labor 5 labor 5j requires the city council to designate the local law enforcement agency that shall enforce the prohibitions of  64045 the

determination as to whether any part of the area constitutes an enclosed space pursuant to labor 5b the directors determination may be requested as part of an enforcement proceeding or in connection with the building or renovation of a structure that is being proposed as a place where smoking is to be allowed the director shall utilize the following procedure when making such a determination 1 does any portion of the border surrounding the space not have a wall 2 if any portion of the border surrounding the space does not have a wall what percentage of the circumference of the surrounding area does not have a wall while there is no percentage requirement cal osha has advised cities in the past that enclosure is generally understood to mean a space surrounded by four walls a floor and a ceiling cal osha has also stated that on that basis bars taverns or gaming clubs with patio areas which lack a roof or walls would not be an enclosed space likewise the attorney general has opined that walls and roof make it an enclosed space as that term is normally understood however any opening is not enough as the code is liberally construed to reduce employee exposure to tobacco smoke these authorities could be interpreted to mean that a room that is missing a complete wall will not be considered an enclosed space 3 if any portion of the border surrounding the space does not have a wall is that portion directly exposed to outside air with no physical structure separating the space from the outside space 4 is the space separated from the surrounding ground outside this determination is based on attorney general opinion no 971201 wherein the attorney general opined that a bar restaurant or tavern with walls and a roof is separated from surrounding ground when the doors and windows are open 5 if it is questionable whether there is a wall or separation from the surrounding ground does the separation in place allow for ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no wall was in place this element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a wall allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no wall was in place 6 is there a ceiling covering the space 7 if the space has a ceiling does the ceiling permit ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no ceiling was in place this element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a ceiling allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no ceiling was in place 8 is there a roof covering the space 9 if the space has a roof does the roof permit for ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no roof was in place this element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a roof allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no roof was in place 10 does the design of the space or the plans submitted by the applicant take significant steps to reduce employee exposure to environmental tobacco smoke this includes additional steps to increase ventilation in the space beyond ordinary openings to the outside space including mechanical ventilation andor a combination of openings in the ceiling andor wallsseparations 11 is the space a structural part of the building pursuant to labor 5b labor 5b states that enclosed space includes lobbies lounges waiting areas elevators stairwells and restrooms that are a structural part of the building and not specifically defined in subdivision d 12 can it be said that the space is an enclosed space pursuant to labor 5 the attorney general has opined that although the phrase enclosed space has some inherent vagueness it gives fair warning of the statutes application based on the above factors is the space an enclosed space  1072014   appeal a all actions and decisions of

shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not to exceed six months or both part 2007  11152016 chapter 990  prohibition against certain forms of aggressive and unsafe panhandling   purpose and findings a the purpose and intent of this chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life of the city of commerce by imposing reasonable time place and manner restrictions on aggressive intrusive or unsafe panhandling while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens b aggressive and intrusive panhandling typically includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city council finds that an increase in aggressive panhandling throughout the city has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public but has also created an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder c the city council finds that panhandling from people in places where they are a captive audience in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid panhandling from others is problematic and presents a risk to the health safety and welfare of the public such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops as well as gasoline stations the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who panhandle money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property restricting panhandling in such places will provide a balance between the rights of panhandlers and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such panhandlings and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations d the city council finds that panhandling on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers drivers pedestrians and the general public panhandling on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems e the city council further finds that the practice of panhandling near driveways accessing shopping centers retail and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers drivers pedestrians and the general public the location of the panhandler near the driveway compromises the panhandlers safety impedes visibility and impairs a drivers ability to safely enter and exit drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems f this law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest the goal of this law is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling that have become an unwelcome presence in the city and to protect the safety of the general public  1192018   definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section

requirement  chapter 1505  abatement of unused or abandoned service stations   purpose the council declares that its purpose in adopting this chapter is to eliminate public nuisances that are created when service stations are abandoned or unused for long periods of time the council finds and determines that 1 the fire code of the city requires that underground tanks that were used to store flammable or combustible liquids be removed or filled completely with an inert material whenever such tanks are taken out of service for ninety days or more  2 abandoned or unused service stations the underground storage tanks of which have been removed or filled with inert material often cannot thereafter be used as service stations because the cost of replacing such underground tanks or restoring them to serviceable condition is excessive in relation to the economic benefit to be derived therefrom  3 unused or abandoned service stations often cannot be easily or inexpensively adapted to other uses even assuming such is allowed in the particular zone or zones where such service stations are situated because of their unique location in relation to the property lines of their lots their unique architectural design and their unique structural appurtenances  4 unused or abandoned service stations are often situated in locations that are uneconomic for such uses as demonstrated by frequent changes of ownership thereof and the service stations in the city that are now unused and which have been unused for more than twelve months  5 unused or abandoned service stations constitute dangers to the public health welfare and safety in that such conditions invite vandalism arson other fire hazards rodent infestation and unsightliness and blight that depreciate values of surrounding properties  6 the existence of such conditions contravene the purposes of the zoning ordinances and the general plan of the city in that planning for a compatible blend of land uses will be disrupted because the lands affected cannot be reasonably put to other uses until the existing conditions are abated by restoration or removal of the buildings and also in that planning for other uses will be prevented unless such abatement is accomplished  7 the existence of unused or abandoned service stations is injurious and inimical to the public health safety comfort and welfare of the community in that such conditions invite unsightliness blight fire hazards infestation decreasing values to surrounding properties and vandalism and the existence of conditions which invite such ills constitute such abuses of property as to entitle this city to exercise its police powers in order to protect the health safety comfort and welfare of the community and of its residents  8 that the provisions of this chapter are categorically exempt under this citys adopted environmental guidelines and procedures  9 this city has the responsibility for strict enforcement of zoning and building regulations and that in the interest of safeguarding the public health safety comfort and welfare of the community abatement is now required of abandoned or unused service stations  10 unless corrective measures are undertaken to alleviate such present conditions and particularly to avoid future problems in this regard a serious threat to the public health safety comfort and welfare of the residents and a serious threat to the values of surrounding properties in this city will continue to exist  that the need of the city to deal with conditions under the procedures established in this chapter outweighs the utility of the conditions as they exist  and that the procedures established in this chapter for the abatement demolition and removal andor enjoinment of the conditions declared by this chapter to constitute public nuisances are declared to be necessary and reasonable and that they afford a maximum of due process part 1976   enforcement authority there is delegated to the director of community

three manufacturing zones are established to provide locations for the assembly manufacture processing and distribution of a wide variety of goods and materials and to allow complementary commercial uses to locate in proximity to such uses the different manufacturing zones are designed to concentrate these activities in appropriate areas of the city to promote efficiency in street and utility design to segregate these uses from sensitive residential uses and to ensure availability of adequate public services 1 commercialmanufacturing cm1 the cm1 zone is established to provide for a wide variety of commercial uses and limited compatible light industrial uses the intent of the zone is to concentrate these uses along major arterials and in other areas that provide easy access and convenience the industrial uses considered appropriate in the cm1 zone are limited to support services such as machine shops and some light manufacturing commercial or industrial uses that might create offensive levels of noise air pollution glare radioactivity or other nuisances are prohibited from this zone 2 light manufacturing zone m1 the m1 zone is designed to preserve city land appropriate for mediumintensity industrial uses to attract and preserve desirable industrial plants and to provide an aesthetically pleasing industrial environment the intent of the m1 zone is to provide safeguards and appropriate transitions to surrounding land uses that may be sensitive to industrial activities and to permit efficient design of infrastructure and public service to serve these uses 3 heavy manufacturing zone m2 the purpose of the m2 zone is to provide land suitable for heavy industrial uses this zone is also the only zone where adult businesses and adult entertainment enterprises may be located in the city the requirements of the zone are intended to provide safeguards and to establish adequate buffer distances between uses that pose potentially adverse public health safety and welfare impacts and land uses in adjacent more restrictive zone districts part 2000   use regulations a table a identifies the uses permitted in the manufacturing districts the uses
