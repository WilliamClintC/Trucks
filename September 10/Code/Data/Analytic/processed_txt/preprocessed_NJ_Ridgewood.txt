permits 20% coverage the development proposes 3000 square feet of coverage in zone a and 2000 square feet of coverage in zone b for a total of 5000 square feet of coverage the permitted coverage for the abovegrade structures would be 23% of the lot area calculated as follows 3000 square feet coverage proposed in zone a  5000 square feet total proposed coverage   60% of total coverage proposed in zone a 2000 square feet coverage proposed in zone b  5000 square feet total proposed coverage   40% of total coverage proposed in zone b 60% of total coverage proposed in zone a x 25% coverage
