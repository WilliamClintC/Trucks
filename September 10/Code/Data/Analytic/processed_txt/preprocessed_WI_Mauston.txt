sewer mains sewer laterals water mains water laterals sidewalks and curb and gutter where necessary before embarking on this project the city has determined that it is fair reasonable and necessary to establish a policy for the payment of these repair and reconstruction costs which policy will be consistently applied throughout the city during the term of this program the council has spent many months evaluating the various ways and means by which funds could be raised to pay for these projects given all the facts the council believes that the following is the best policy for payment b policy  the following policy shall apply to all property in the city which pays real estate taxes 1 the cost to repair and reconstruct the following items shall be paid by the city general tax levy a streets including base and surface b sewer mains manholes and lift stations c water mains d water laterals extending from the water main to the curb stop e storm sewers 2 property owners including the

regrade the property to avoid the use of a retaining wall the city council may elect to pay for part or all of the retaining wall f any and all other public rightofway improvements which provide a benefit to the adjoining property owner 100 percent of cost c policy for taxexempt property  the policy for property which does not pay real estate taxes and which in turn does not support these projects general tax levy is as follows 1 the total cost 100 percent to repair and reconstruct streets including but not limited to curb gutter sidewalk sewer mains water mains storm sewer lights excavation base course surfacing and other appurtenances shall be paid by the adjacent taxexempt property owner unless reduced as provided below 2 the common council may but is not required to deviate from the foregoing policy on a casebycase basis and may lower the assessment whenever it deems a reduction is just and reasonable in making this determination the common council may consider the following circumstances among others a whether the street reconstruction project is requested andor necessitated by the taxexempt entity or by the city or some other entity b whether the taxexempt entity has the authority to raise funds to pay for the special assessment imposition of taxes c whether the taxexempt entity serves or is supported by persons the vast majority of which are tax paying citizens of the city 50 newconstruction projects a purpose the city has determined that it is fair reasonable and necessary to establish a policy for the payment of construction costs for new construction in the city which policy will be consistently applied throughout the city the council has spent many months evaluating the various ways and means to pay for new construction and given all the facts the council believes that the following is the best policy for payment b policy 1 the costs to construct the following new items shall be paid in full by the ownerdeveloper a the base eg aggregate crushed rock breaker run sand lift etc for the new street including the associated costs of excavation earth work grading placement compaction and shaping of the base b curb and gutter c water mains fire hydrants valves curb stops service lines to the property line and all other water appurtenances including the excavation work and earth work associated with the installation of the

common council may deviate from the foregoing policy on a casebycase basis provided the following conditions are met 1 vote an exception shall not be permitted unless it is approved by the twothirds vote of the whole council 2 special circumstances the common council must determine that one or more of the following special circumstances exist a where unusual physical circumstances exist eg bridges river frontage interstate highways state trunk highways rock formations drainage problems etc which increase the cost of the project and which if overcome will provide a benefit to other parts of the city and not just to the ownerdeveloper or the assessed property  b where special features are designed into the project eg extra wide roads roads with extra base to accommodate heavier traffic oversized sewer mains andor water mains to accommodate further expansion etc which increase the cost of the project and which are designed to provide a benefit to other parts of the city and not just to the ownerdeveloper or the assessed property  or c where the financial benefit to the city of the proposed project in terms of estimated tax revenue to be generated from the project is sufficient to justify a modification of the assessment against such property 51 assessments against township property a purpose the city has determined that it is fair reasonable and necessary to establish a policy for the handling of assessments for improvements which benefit or may benefit property located in townships adjacent to the city the council believes it is unfair for city residents to pay for the construction of public improvements only to have adjacent township property owners annex to the city and receive the full benefit of such improvements after the cost of such improvements have been fully paid therefore after thorough evaluation of this problem the council believes that the following is the best policy for handling such matters b policy 1 property not located within the city shall not receive the benefit of public improvements made by the city for example property not located within the city may not hook onto city sewer andor water 2 whenever the city constructs improvements along township property the city shall assess the township property in the same manner as if such property were located within the city however payment of such assessments against township property shall be deferred upon such terms and conditions as the council deems appropriate until such property annexes into the city and receives the benefit of the improvement for example if the city extends sewer and water down a street where one side is located in the city and that other side is located in a township the side located in the township shall be assessed its fair share of the sewer and water improvement but such assessment shall be deferred until the township property annexes into the city and hooks onto the sewer and water 52 streets sidewalks and other public places

4112017 natural resource protection overlay zoning categories a introduction this section contains the standards governing the protection disturbance and mitigation of disruption of all natural resource areas these provisions are intended to supplement those of the city county state and the federal government pertaining to natural resource protection prior to using the provisions of these sections to determine the permitted disruption of such areas the requirements provided below should be reviewed these sections recognize the important and diverse benefits which natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community each of these sections is oriented to each natural resource type and is designed to accomplish several objectives 1 a definition of the natural resource is provided 2 the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural resource type are provided 3 the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given 4 a list of land uses which are permitted by right permitted by conditional use or prohibited are provided 5 mandatory protection requirements are identified b purpose this section sets forth the requirements for the mandatory protection of natural resources resource protection area rpa within the jurisdiction of this chapter the provisions of this section interact closely with the regulations applicable to each zoning district in article ii of this chapter with the regulations applicable to each land use of article iv of this chapter and with the density and intensity standards of section 11452 c floodplain overlay zoning districts fp floodplain overlay zoning including zoning in floodway districts floodfringe districts and floodplain districts is governed by chapter 104 d shorelandwetland overlay zoning district sw shorelandwetland overlay zoning is governed by chapter 110 e lakeshore overlay zoning district ls 1 definition the term lakeshore means those lands lying between the ordinary water line of navigable waters and either the backside of the principal structure on the lot  or a point 75 feet from said water line whichever is closer to said water line the term lakeshore shall not include those lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches where such lands are not adjacent to a navigable stream or river  those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching or had no previous stream history  and such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use decorative water features shall not be considered navigable waters for the purposes of this section this meaning of the term lakeshores shall remain distinct from the meaning of the term as employed by the state statutes and the dnr 2 purpose of lakeshore protection requirements lakeshores serve to protect landwater margins from erosion due to site disruption because of regular contact with wave action currents and runoff such areas are highly susceptible to continuous and in some cases rapid erosion lakeshore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy and filters significant amounts of waterborne pollutants and sediments lakeshores also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin lakeshores also protect and promote the natural beauty of the shore by controlling and limiting the development of structures within the lakeshore

the ordinary high water mark of an intermittent stream or open channel drainageway as shown on usgs 75minute topographic maps for the city and its environs 2 purpose of drainageway protection requirements drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and lakeshore water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement 3 determination of drainageway boundaries general drainageway boundaries are depicted on the official zoning map upon the

issuance of conditional use permits for the placement construction or modification of communication towers as defined in section 11416 b it is intended that conditional use permits shall be issued under this section to accommodate the expansion of wireless communication technology while minimizing the number of tower sites requirement that permitted towers be placed or constructed so that they may be utilized for the collocation of antenna arrays to the extent technologically and economically feasible c no conditional use permit for the placement or construction of a tower shall be issued unless the applicant presents to the city staff credible evidence establishing to a reasonable degree of certainty the following 1 no existing communication tower is located within the area in which the applicants equipment must be located  or 2 no existing communication tower within the area in which the applicants equipment must be located is of sufficient height to meet applicants requirements and the deficiency in height cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost  or 3 no existing communication tower within the area in which the applicants equipment must be located has sufficient structural strength to support applicants equipment and the deficiency in structural strength cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost  or 4 the applicants equipment would cause electromagnetic interference with equipment on the existing communication towers within the area in which the applicants equipment must be located or the equipment on the existing communication towers would cause interference with the applicants equipment and the interference from whatever source cannot be eliminated at a reasonable cost  or 5 the fees costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to collocate on an existing communication tower are unreasonable relative to industry norms  or 6 the applicant demonstrates that there are other factors that render existing communication towers unsuitable or unavailable and establishes that the public interest is best served by the placement or construction of a new communication tower 7 the cost of eliminating impediments to collocation shall be deemed reasonable if it does not exceed by 25 percent the cost of constructing a new tower on which to mount applicants equipment 8 in the event the city staff determines that it is necessary to consult with a third party in considering the factors listed in subsection 2 above all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such consultation shall be borne by the applicant failure to pay such costs and expenses or provide information requested by the committee shall be grounds for denial or revocation of a conditional use permit the applicant may provide to the committee the names of consultants

use permits for the placement or construction of a communication tower the city staff shall unless it is shown to be unreasonable condition the grant of the permit upon the applicant placing or constructing the communication tower so as to accommodate at a minimum height of 150 feet the collocation of two additional antenna arrays similar in size and function to that placed on the tower by the applicant collocation sites need not be available on the tower as initially placed or constructed provided that the tower will support at the specified minimum height the later addition of the required number of collocation sites notwithstanding the height and number of collocation sites on the tower as initially placed or constructed the communication tower design approved and permitted under this chapter shall be for a tower of 150 feet in height and shall include the required collocation sites the holder of a permit under this section shall make the collocation sites required hereunder available for the placement of technologically compatible antenna arrays and equipment upon contractual provisions which are standard in the industry and at prevailing market rates allowing

for a conditional use for conservancy regulations in the shorelandwetland floodway floodplain conservancy or floodway fringe overlay zoning districts to the state department of natural resources dnr for review and comment at least ten days prior to any public hearings final action on the application shall not be taken for 30 days or until the dnr has made its recommendation whichever comes first a copy of all decisions relating to conditional uses for shorelandwetland conservancy regulations or to floodland regulations shall be transmitted to the dnr within ten days of the date of such decision o uses now regulated as conditional uses which were approved as legal land uses permitted by right or as conditional uses prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived a use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use either permitted by right or as a conditional use prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be considered as a legal conforming land use so long as the previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall require submission of a new application for a conditional use pursuant to the foregoing procedures p minor changes prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy the zoning administrator with the consent of either the city administrator or the dpw is authorized to approve minor variations and minor changes to any previouslygranted conditional use without compliance with the notice and public hearing procedures of subsection f of this section provided 1 the variations do not violate any of the minimum standards of this chapter  and 2 the spirit and intent of the original conditional use is preserved all such variations shall be approved in writing and whenever the variation changes any term or condition of a written resolution previously recorded with the register of deeds the variation shall also be recorded 3 rationale the intent of this section is to avoid the expensive and timeconsuming process of a public hearing and public notice whenever a minor change is needed on a site plan or a conditional use during construction problems often arise which require minor changes to site plans or conditional uses it is expensive timeconsuming unnecessary and wasteful for the applicant and the plan commission to go whole conditional use process just to approve a minor change  1 4112017 zoning permits for temporary uses a

following factors must be found to exist by the board of appeals in making its decision regarding a request for a variance and each factor shall be addressed in the boards official written decision a the requested variance must be in harmony with the recommendations of the comprehensive master plan b the land must present an exceptional or extraordinary circumstance or condition which unreasonably prevents the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or which makes conformity with the requirements of this chapter unnecessarily burdensome the response to this question shall clearly indicate how the subject property contains factors which are not present on other properties in the same zoning district specifically 1 the hardship or difficulty shall be peculiar to the subject property and different from that of other properties and not one which affects all properties similarly such a hardship or difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual shape of the original acreage parcel  unusual topography or elevation  or because the property was created before the passage of the current applicable zoning regulations and will not accommodate a structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area requirements are observed  2 loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not in and of itself be grounds for a variance  3 selfimposed hardship shall not be grounds for a variance reductions resulting from the sale of portions of a property reducing the remainder of said property below buildable size or cuttingoff existing access to a public rightofway or deed restrictions imposed by the owners predecessorintitle are considered to be such selfimposed hardships  4 violations by or variances granted to neighboring properties shall not justify a variance  5 the alleged hardship shall not be one that would have existed in the absence of a zoning ordinance  for example if a lot were unbuildable because of topography in the absence of any or all setback requirements c the variance must be needed so that the subject property can be developed in a manner similar to that of other properties under the same zoning district the response to this question shall clearly indicate how the requested variance is essential to make the subject property reasonably developable so that property rights enjoyed by the owners of similar properties can be enjoyed by the owners of the subject property d the granting of the proposed variance must not be a substantial detriment to adjacent properties the response to this question shall clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial impact on adjacent properties e the granting of the proposed variance must not result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood environmental factors traffic factors parking public improvements public property or rightsofway or other matters affecting the public health safety or general welfare either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of the intent provisions and policies of this chapter the comprehensive plan or any other plan program map or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development the response to this question shall clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial impact on such longrange planning matters f the exceptional or extraordinary circumstance or condition which the applicant claims as justification for the proposed variance must not have been created by the acts or omissions of the applicant or the applicants predecessorintitle eg previous development decisions such as building placement floor plan building orientation platting pattern grading etc after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived the response to this question shall clearly indicate that such factors existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and were not created by action of the applicant or the applicants predecessorsintitle g if the proposed variance is a use variance then in addition to the foregoing standards the applicant must also establish that the applicant will have no reasonable use of the property if the variance is not granted 6 additional requirements in floodland districts no variance shall be granted when it is found a filling and development contrary to the purpose and intent of the floodplain overlay district fp would result b a change in the boundaries of the floodplain overlay district fp would result c a lower degree of flood protection than a point two feet above the 100year recurrence interval flood for the particular area would result d any action contrary to the provisions of wis admin nr 116 would result 7 effect of inaction if the zoning board of appeals fails to make a determination within 30 days after said public hearing then the request for the variance shall be considered denied g effect of denial no application for a variance which has been denied in whole or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial unless the zoning administrator first determines that either 1 substantial and material new evidence has arisen  or 2 a substantial and material change of circumstances has occurred regarding an issue which was relevant and significant to the prior decision to deny the application h limited effect of a variance where the zoning board of appeals has granted a variance such approval shall not change the use classification of either the building or premises nor give it any new status as a nonconforming use other than that status which it held before the granting of the variance granting of a variance shall be considered unique to the variance granted and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed variance i stay of proceedings an application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furthering enforcement of any provisions of this chapter from which the applicant is requesting a variance unless the zoning administrator certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the request for the variance has been filed that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property in such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the zoning board of appeals or by a court of record j notice to the dnr the zoning board of appeals shall transmit a copy of each application for a variance to conservancy regulations in the shorelandwetland floodway floodplain conservancy or floodway fringe overlay zoning districts and a copy of all shoreland floodland appeals to the state department of natural resources dnr for review and comment at least ten days prior to any public hearings final action on the application shall not be taken for 30 days or until the dnr has made its recommendation whichever comes first a copy of all decisions relating to variances to shoreland conservancy regulations or to floodland regulations and a copy of all decisions to shoreland conservancy and floodland appeals shall be transmitted to the dnr within ten days of the date of such decision  1 4112017 interpretations a purpose the purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this chapter and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation b initiation of request for an interpretation proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods 1 by an application of the owner or occupants of the subject property  2 by a request of the plan commission  3 by a request of the common council  or 4 by a request of the zoning administrator c application requirements all applications from the owners or occupants of property shall be submitted to the zoning administrator or designee who shall determine if the application is complete a complete application shall be

specific questions the applicant has regarding said text if the applicant believes that the text is subject to several reasonable interpretations the applicant shall set forth all such interpretations 3 specific property if the requested interpretation relates to the application of this chapter to a specific property the additional following information shall be required a a map of the subject property showing all lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 200 feet of the boundaries of the subject property together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the city tax records said map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet all lot dimensions of the subject property a graphic scale and a north arrow shall be provided  b a map such as the land use plan map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation to the city as a whole  c a written explanation of the issue which needs interpretation including the applicants proposed interpretation and an explanation of how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities buildings and structures currently located on andor proposed for the subject property  and d if requested by the zoning administrator a site plan of the subject property as proposed for development said site plan shall conform to all the requirements of section 114291c or such requirements as the administrator may require 4 land use if the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this chapter a series of written responses to the following questions a how is the subject land use in general in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the citys comprehensive plan this chapter and any other plan program or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city b how is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought c do the potential public benefits of the proposed interpretation outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed interpretation d review by zoning administrator 1 the zoning administrator or designee shall determine whether the application fulfills the requirements of subsection c of this section if the zoning administrator determines that the application does not fulfill the requirements of subsection c of this section he shall return the application to the applicant with a brief statement identifying how the application is inadequate if the zoning administrator determines that the application does fulfill the requirements of subsection c of this section he shall commence his review thereof 2 within 30 days of filing of a complete application the zoning administrator shall review and evaluate the application this review shall take into consideration the standards for review presented in subsection e of this section in evaluating the application the zoning administrator may consult with consultants and city staff such as the city attorney city planner dpw city administrator andor city engineer the zoning administrator shall also evaluate the application to determine whether the request is in harmony with the recommendations of the citys comprehensive master plan 3 the zoning administrator or such consultants or staff as the zoning administrator may deem appropriate eg city attorney shall prepare and forward a written report to the applicant indicating the interpretation of the zoning administrator if the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the citys comprehensive master plan the zoning administrator shall note this determination in the report a copy of all such reports shall be forwarded to the plan commission e standards for review of requested interpretations this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the common council as noted in this chapter and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows 1 articulate certain public purpose underlying the standard for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be a discussion of the purpose for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated 2 articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the chapter design freedom is to be encouraged but a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited 3 determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements 4 avoid substituting the judgment of the administrator for the legislative acts of the common council rationale this chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council 5 address the following standards on land use interpretation matters a no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation b no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property c no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district d no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category e if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to section 114288 f effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter these permits and approvals include but are not limited to required site plans special use permits conditional uses and certificates of occupancy g limitations on favorable land use interpretation 1 no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation unless a building permit is issued and development is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period 2 an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued the interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued a favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall for any reason be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more 3 an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted by right or conditionally permitted shall have no precedential value it is understood that if the plan commission wished such interpretation to have precedential value it would amend this chapter to include such interpretation herein it is also understood that mistakes in interpretation often become apparent only after the interpretation becomes effective and the use is employed and observed  1 4112017 appeals of zoning decisions a purpose the purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and decide requests for appeals from the decisions of the zoning administrator per section 114295 as provided for by wis stats  62237e7 b initiation of request for review of zoning decision

planned development district procedures a purpose the purpose of this section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval or denial of proposed planned developments and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district 1 planned developments are intended to provide more incentives for development and redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of significant investment furthermore planned developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the city by controlling the site design and the appearance density or intensity of development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses density intensity bulk landscaping and parking requirements in exchange for such flexibility the planned development shall provide a much higher level of site design architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments 2 planned developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter in addition to such potential planned developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan landscape plan and architectural plan and on a casebycase basis in order to prevent this from occurring all planned developments are required to meet certain stringent procedural requirements applicable only to planned developments in addition to the general requirements of this chapter a public hearing process is required to review a request for a planned development this process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with that required for a conditional use with several additional requirements b extent of flexible development standards 1 permitted location planned developments shall be permitted with the approval of a planned development zoning district specific to the approved planned development within all zoning districts 2 flexible development standards the following exemptions to the development standards of the underlying zoning district may be provided with the approval of a planned development a land use requirements all land uses listed as residential institutional or commercial in article ii of this chapter may be permitted within a planned development b density and intensity requirements all requirements listed in article ii of this chapter for residential density and nonresidential intensity may be waived or modified within a planned development c bulk requirements all bulk requirements listed in article ii of this chapter may be waived or modified within a planned development d landscaping requirements all requirements listed in article vi of this chapter may be waived or modified within a planned development e parking and loading requirements all requirements listed in sections 11455 and 11457 may be waived or modified within a planned development 3 requirements to depict all aspects of development only development which is explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the common council as part of the approved planned development shall be permitted even if such development including all aspects of land use density and intensity bulk landscaping and parking and loading is otherwise listed as permitted in article ii of this chapter requested exemptions from these standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the common council if not so requested and approved such exemptions shall not be permitted c initiation of request for approval of a planned development proceedings for approval of a planned development shall be initiated by 1 an application of the owner of the subject property  2 a recommendation of the plan commission  or 3 action of the common council d application requirements all applications for proposed planned developments regardless of the party of their initiation per subsection c of this section shall be approved as complete by the zoning administrator a minimum of two weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure the zoning administrator shall forward copies of said complete application to the office of the city clerk said application shall apply to each of the process steps in subsections e h of this section e step 1 preapplication conference 1 the applicant shall contact the zoning administrator to place an informal discussion item for the pd on the plan commission agenda 2 to be placed on the agenda no details are required except the following the names and addresses of the applicant the owner of the site the architect professional engineer and contractor being used on the project if known and the address and tax parcel number for the site 3 at the plan commission meeting the applicant shall engage in an informal discussion with the plan commission regarding the potential pd appropriate topics for discussion may include the location of the pd general project themes and images the general mix of dwelling unit types andor land uses being considered approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities the general treatment of natural features the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets and relationship to the master plan 4 points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall not be binding directly or indirectly upon the applicant or the city but shall be considered as merely an informal nonbinding discussion designed to give the applicant some feedback positive andor negative on the proposal and to give the plan commission some general background before proceeding to the next step f step 2 concept plan 1 submittal packet the applicant shall submit to the zoning administrator a draft pd concept plan submittal packet which shall contain all of the following items a location map a location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11 inches by 17 inches as depicted on a copy of the city land use plan map  b general description a general written description of proposed pd including 1 general project themes and images  2 the general mix of dwelling unit types andor land uses  3 approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities as described by dwelling units per acre floor area ratio and impervious surface area ratio  4 the general treatment of natural features  5 the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets  6 the general relationship of the project to the master plan  7 an initial draft list of zoning standards which will not be met by the proposed pd and the location in which they apply and a complete list of zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed pd and the location in which they apply essentially the purpose of this listing shall be to provide the plan commission with information necessary to determine the relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public benefit and in regard to the mitigation of potential adverse impacts created by design flexibility  c requested exemptions a written description of potentially requested exemption from the requirements of the underlying zoning district in the following order 1 land use exemptions  2 density and intensity exemptions  3 bulk exemptions  4 landscaping exemptions  and 5 parking and loading requirements exemptions  and d conceptual plan a conceptual plan drawing at 11 inches by 17 inches of the general land use layout and the general location of major public streets andor private drives the applicant may submit copies of a larger version of the bubble plan in addition to the 11 inches by 17 inches reduction 2 review by administrator the zoning administrator or designee shall determine whether the pd concept submittal packet fulfills the requirements of subsection f1 of this section if the zoning administrator determines that the packet does not fulfill the requirements of subsection f1 of this section he shall return it to the applicant with a brief statement identifying how it is inadequate if the administrator determines that the packet fulfills the requirements of subsection f1 of this section he shall so notify applicant and shall place the matter on the plan commission agenda 3 review by plan commission at the plan commission meeting the applicant shall engage in an informal discussion with the plan commission regarding the conceptual pd appropriate topics for discussion may include any of the information provided in the pd concept plan submittal packet or other items as determined by the plan commission 4 nonbinding effect points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall not be binding directly or indirectly upon the applicant or the city but shall be considered as merely an informal nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step rationale the foregoing procedures are intended to give the plan commission several informal reviews of the concept plan before introduction of the formal petition for rezoning which accompanies the next step the formal gdp application although timeconsuming this informal process is designed to give the plan commission lots of time to consider the pd and at the same time give the applicant lots of feedback so that the time and expense of the formal petition is minimized or perhaps eliminated by incorporation into the gdp of the comments and concerns raised during this preliminary informal process g step 3 general development plan gdp 1 purpose the purpose of this step is to evaluate whether the zoning for the proposed site should be changed from its current zoning to pd zoning which will create zoning unique to the property therefore the focus of this step is on the same types of issues which affect all changes of zoning ie density intensity the mix of use and the arrangement of site design 2 submittal packet the applicant shall submit to the zoning administrator a draft gpd plan submittal packet which shall contain all of the following items a location map a location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11 inches by 17 inches as depicted on a copy of the city land use plan map b ownership map a map of the subject property showing

environs and the jurisdiction which maintains that control said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet all lot dimensions of the subject property a graphic scale and a north arrow shall be provided c general description a general written description of the proposed pd including 1 general project themes and images  2 the general mix of dwelling unit types andor land uses  3 approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities as described by dwelling units per acre floor area ratio and impervious surface area ratio  4 the general treatment of natural features  5 the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets  6 the general relationship of the project to the master plan  7 a statement of rationale as to why pd zoning is proposed this shall identify barriers that the applicant perceives in the form of requirements of standard zoning districts and opportunities for community betterment the applicant suggests are available proposed pd zoning  8 a complete list of zoning standards which will not be met by the proposed pd and the location in which they apply and a complete list of zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed pd and the location in which they apply shall be identified essentially the purpose of this listing shall be to provide the plan commission with information necessary to determine the relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public benefit and in regard to the mitigation of potential adverse impacts created by design flexibility  9 a written description of potentially requested exemption from the requirements of the underlying zoning district in the following order i land use exemptions  ii density and intensity exemptions  iii bulk exemptions  iv landscaping exemptions  v parking and loading requirements exemptions d gdp drawing a general development plan drawing at a minimum scale of one inch equals 100 feet an 11 inches by 17 inches reduction shall also be provided by applicant of the proposed project showing at least the following information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against criteria for approval 1 a conceptual plan drawing at 11 inches by 17 inches of the general land
