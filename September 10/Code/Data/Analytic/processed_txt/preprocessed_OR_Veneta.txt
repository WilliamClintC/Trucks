veneta city charter grants to the city all powers that the constitutions statutes and common law of the united states and of the state of oregon now or hereafter expressly or impliedly grant or allow 2among the powers granted to the city is the power to impose license requirements and charges such licenses may include charges for the privilege of conducting business within the city and for the use

other use of facilities placed in the public ways by themselves and others 5the city desires to facilitate making communication services available to citizens by itself working to provide amenities that make veneta a better place to do business for most utilities this includes but is not limited to the city permitting use of the public ways for the support of utility services so long as such use is consistent with and does not unduly burden or interfere with the principal purpose of the public ways which is to facilitate the free movement of persons and goods in commerce 6the city holds the

as a means to install infrastructure ostensibly for one purpose which can then be used for multiple services where a provider provides services not covered by a franchise within the city it is appropriate that the provider be subject to the charges set forth in this chapter so that the payments accurately reflect the range of advantages derived from the opportunity to provide services within the city and where appropriate especially the use of the rightsofway of the city the intent of this chapter is to treat all providers in an equal manner subjecting all providers and all types

from the opportunity to provide services within the city and where appropriate especially the use of the rightsofway of the city the intent of this chapter is to treat all providers in an equal manner

parkland and open space is a critical element in maintaining and improving the quality of life in veneta land that features trees grass and vegetation provides not only an aesthetically pleasing landscape but also buffers incompatible uses and preserves sensitive environmental features and important resources parks and open space together with support facilities also help to meet the active and passive recreational needs of the population of veneta this chapter implements goals and policies of h of the comprehensive plan and the parks master plan by outlining requirements for dedication of parks and open space in the city of veneta 2 minimum parkland dedication requirements parkland dedication new residential subdivisions planned developments including plans implementing the specific development plan sdp subzone multifamily or manufactured home park developments shall be required to provide parkland to serve existing and future residents of those developments multifamily developments which provide some congregate services andor facilities such as group transportation dining halls emergency monitoring systems etc but which have individual dwelling units rather than

which provide their clients with individual beds and sleeping quarters but in which all other care and services are communal and provided by facility employees are specifically exempt from parkland dedication requirements a the required parkland shall be dedicated as a condition of approval for the following 1 tentative plat for a subdivision or partition  land development page | 131 2 planned developments including those in the planned development pd and specific development plan sdp subzones for specific development plans that have dedicated park space equal to or in excess of that required by this ordinance no additional dedication is required at the time of subdivision 3 site plan review for a multifamily development or manufactured home park  and 4 replat or amendment of any site plan for multifamily development or manufactured home park where dedication has not previously been made or where the density of the development involved will be increased b calculation of required dedication the required parkland acreage to be dedicated is based on a calculation of the following formula rounded to the nearest 1100 001 of an acre required parkland dedication acres   proposed units x personsunit x  per person park land dedication factor 1 population formula the following table shall be used to determine the number of persons per unit to be used in calculating required parkland dedication type of unit total persons per unit single family residential 3 standard multifamily unit 2 manufactured dwelling park 2 congregate multifamily unit 15 2 persons per unit age distribution and local conditions change with time the specific formula for the dedication of land will therefore be subject to periodic review and amendment 3 per person parkland dedication factor the total parkland dedication requirement shall be  of an acre per person based on the adopted standard of acres of land per one thousand of ultimate population according to the veneta parks recreation and open space master plan this standard represents the citywide landto population ratio for city parks and may be adjusted periodically to the parks master plan 3 minimum park land standards land required or proposed for parkland dedication shall be contained within a continuous unit and must be suitable for active use as a neighborhood or minipark exceptions to any or all of

phase improvements to the land as required by veneta land division shall be made prior to approval of the final plat for the phase that includes the park land 5 cash in lieu of dedication at the citys discretion only the city may accept payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication the city may require payment in lieu of land when the park land to be dedicated does not meet the standards stated above or when a fee is determined to be in the best interest of the city as determined by the planning commission a payment in lieu of land dedication is separate from park systems development charges sdc and is eligible for a credit only for that portion of the sdc attributable to land acquisition the amount of the fee in lieu of land dedication in dollars per acre shall be set by city council
