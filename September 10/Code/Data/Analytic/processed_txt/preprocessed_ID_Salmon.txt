management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human life health and property therefore the salmon city council of the city of salmon idaho does hereby ordain as follows 172 findings of fact  the flood hazard areas of the city of salmon are subject to periodic inundation that results in 1 loss of life and property  2 health and safety hazards  3 disruption of commerce and governmental services  4 extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection  and 5 impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare  these flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  local government units have the primary responsibility for planning adopting and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain management 173 statement of purpose the purpose of this ordinance is to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to  protect human life health and property   minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water purification and sewage treatment plants water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains   help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas   minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects   minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public   minimize prolonged business interruptions   ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of special flood hazard  and  of 135  ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 174 objectives and methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this ordinance includes methods and provisions to  require that development which is vulnerable to floods including structures and facilities necessary for the general health safety and welfare of citizens be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction   restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion   control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion   prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands   preserve and restore natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters 175 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to
