residents of the proposed land development or subdivision the planning board may in its discretion require the payment of a feeinlieu of land dedication or a combination of land dedication and payment of a fee as an alternative to the dedication of land 2 relationship to comprehensive plan no dedication of land to the public or paymentinlieu of such dedications shall be required unless the need for such is documented in the adopted plans of the town ie the comprehensive community plan the local recreation conservation and open space plan or the capital improvement program cip the requirement for dedication of land for open space conservation park and recreation facilities shall be based upon the policies and standards set forth in the above plan or in the cip and shall reflect the character defined for the neighborhood or district in which the subdivision is located by comprehensive community plan the nature of the land dedication must reflect the character of the land being subdivided and must be suitable for the intended use if payments inlieuofland dedications are required they must be kept in a restricted account and shall only be spent for the intended purpose of providing open space conservation park and recreation facilities 3 amount of land to be dedicated the minimum amount of land to be dedicated shall be based upon the following formula amount of land dedicated   number of house lots x minimum lot size in the underlying zoning district x three percent further subdivision of such lots may be subject to further fees 4 ownership of land land dedicated under the provisions of this subject to the approval of the planning board be dedicated by transfer of fee simple ownership to the town or in the case of a conservation development to an agency or organization as provided in section 512d 5 feesinlieuofland dedication where a fee is required by the planning board to be paid inlieuof land dedication the amount of such fee shall be based on the fair market value of the amount of undeveloped land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated under subsection 3 hereof fair market value of the land shall be established by the exeter tax assessor at the time of final plan review fair market value shall be established assuming subdivision approval has been granted and review of recent sales of comparable vacant undeveloped land within the town and neighboring towns the amount of such fee shall be determined by the following formula feeinlieu of land dedication   fair market value per acre of undeveloped land x amount of land to be dedicated a if the subdivider objects to such amount of evaluation heshe may at hisher own expense obtain two separate independent appraisals of the property by qualified real estate appraisers which appraisals may be accepted by the planning board if found to be reasonable  or b the planning board and subdivider may agree as to the fair market value 6 use of fees collected feesinlieu of land dedication shall be held by the town treasurer in a restricted account for recreation and open space activities only such account shall be used to purchase maintain and operate parks playgrounds recreational

and income groups and residential preferences so that the population diversity of the community may be maintained  f to implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally important resources as set forth in the comprehensive plan g to provide reasonable incentives for the creation of a contiguous greenway system within the town  h to implement adopted land use transportation and community service policies as set forth in the comprehensive plan i to protect areas of the town with productive agricultural soils to encourage continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm operations  j to create neighborhoods with direct visual andor physical access to open land with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space and with a strong neighborhood identity  k to provide for the maintenance of open land set aside for active or passive recreational use storm water drainage or conservation lands  l to conserve and create scenic views and preserve the rural character of the town  m to provide a buffer between new development and existing streets neighborhoods active farmland and adjacent park or conservation land applicability a in accordance with the standards set forth in this section 50 the planning board shall allow all major subdivisions and major land development projects be developed as a conservation development whether a subdivision or not major subdivisions and major land development projects shall be required to follow the procedure for review and approval prescribed in section 65 b the planning board shall allow a minor subdivision or minor land development project to be developed as a conservation development if it finds that a conservation development would a better form of development after consideration of the general purposes and required standards for subdivisions and land development projects set forth in these regulations and after consideration of the purposes of conservation developments set forth in section 51 procedures applications for conservation development approval shall be made in accordance with the procedures for approval of a major or minor subdivision or land development project based on the number of lots or dwellings in the development as provided in section 60 of these regulations design process the design of a conservation development shall follow the design process specified in the following steps as a guide in designing conservation developments applicants are encouraged to review the provisions of the rhode island conservation development manual ridem june 2003 in the preparation of plans the maps illustrated in this manual will provide graphic examples of what is required of applicants when the master plan is submitted for major land development projects or subdivisions or preliminary plans for minor land development projects or subdivisions applicants shall demonstrate to the planning board that this design process was considered in determining the layout of proposed streets building locations and open space see section 12 for specific requirements step 1  analyze the site the first step is to inventory existing site features taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural scenic and cultural resources on the site and to determine the connection of these important features to each other and strategies for protection for preapplication meetings the applicant shall submit the information required by the preapplication checklist for master plan meetings this information shall be submitted in the form of an existing resources and site analysis map as specified in section 516 step 2  evaluate site context the second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context of the neighborhood and town by identifying physical eg stream corridors wetlands transportation eg street and bicycle networks and cultural eg open spaces recreational opportunities connections to surrounding land uses and activities this information shall be submitted in the form of a site context map as specified in section 56 step 3  designate potential conservation areas the third step is to identify the areas on the site to be preserved on the site as open space the open space shall at a minimum include portions of the site that are unsuitable for development and which constitute the most sensitive and noteworthy natural cultural and recreational resources of the site where appropriate areas that serve to extend neighborhood open space networks tofrom surrounding property shall be identified the designation of open space shall reflect consistency with the town comprehensive plan step 4  determine maximum number of units at the master plan stage for major subdivisions and major land development projects and at the preliminary stage for minor subdivisions and minor land development projects the applicant and planning board shall agree upon an initial number of dwelling units that will be permitted in the conservation development or subdivision using the yield plan approach as described in section 58 the number of units may be changed by the planning board during subsequent stages of review as more information is provided until the final basic maximum number of dwelling units is determined step 5  locate development areas and explore conceptual alternatives as part of the preapplication submission the applicant shall show a minimum of two alternative proposed development layouts in the form of a sketch plans or sketch plan overlay sheets as described in section 55 these alternative plans shall be substantially different the planning board shall review how each alternative impacts the viability of the development plan versus the benefits to the town of one or another approach this sketch plan shall be further refined for resubmission and discussion between the board and applicant during subsequent stages of review as an overlay to the existing resources and site analysis map section 516 step 6  locate the house sites the sixth step is to locate building sites using the proposed open space as a base map as well as other relevant data on the existing resources and site analysis map the design shall take into account the potential negative impacts of residential development on nearby conservation areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences with emphasis on consistency with the towns rural character step 7  lay out streets trails and other infrastructure upon designation of the building sites a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each building complying with the standards herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions detailed information regarding storm water drainage water supply and sewage disposal trails sidewalks and other infrastructure are also

with conceptual proposals at the early stages of review the function of open space areas shall be developed and refined based on review by the planning board and other reviewers these concepts shall be clarified during the review process to establish as clear an approach to the use and maintenance of open space as it does for development areas step 9  draw in the lot lines upon completion of the preceding eight steps the next step is simply to draw in the lot lines to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots if applicable step 10  establish ownership and management of open space and other community elements at the time of preliminary review for major land development projects or major subdivisions or at the time of final review for minor land development projects or minor subdivisions a more detailed open space use and management plan as described in section 512h shall be submitted sketch plan overlay sheet the design process described above shall be documented by the applicant and presented to the planning board to expedite this process a conceptual sketch plans for development shall be presented as overlay sheets to be superimposed on top of more detailed site surveys and environmental data at the same scale at the preapplication stage of review the initial sketch plan may be presented as an overlay to survey plans topographic maps or aerial photographs of the parcels proposed for development as an alternative if detailed site information and surveys are not available a separate diagrammatic sketch plans may be presented at the preliminary stage of review for minor land development projects and subdivisions and at the master plan stage of review for major land development projects and subdivisions the sketch plan of development shall be presented as an overlay to the existing resources and site analysis map site context map a map showing the location of the proposed development within its neighborhood context

preliminary stage of review for minor subdivisions and minor land development projects the applicant shall use this initial determination as the basis for submission of more detailed information during subsequent stages of review upon further investigation and upon receipt of more detailed soils and environmental information as may be provided in subsequent stages of review the planning board may increase or reduce the number of lotsdwelling units contained in the initial basic maximum number for all developments the final basic maximum number shall be established by the planning board at the final stage of review in developments that require alterations to be made to freshwater wetlands the board may establish an initial basic maximum number contingent upon confirmation by the ri department of environmental management that such alterations are permitted under the provisions of the freshwater wetlands act types and location of buildings a conservation development may contain

____________ known surface waters including rivers streams lakes ponds and wetlands  it is not necessary to field verify wetlands at this stage step 1 existing resources and site analysis maps during site analysis information about natural and cultural factors is collected and mapped creating an objective basis of facts to inform discussions and support fair decisions in this first step the focus is on the site itself its features and capabilities the site analysis process is described in detail in section 54 step 1 of these regulations the number of site analysis maps required will vary with the complexity of each site the following maps should be prepared as separate overlays which can be combined in different ways using geographic information system technology gis to better understand the interaction of the various site features and resource types gis maps are recommended for further information and illustrated examples regarding suggested gis maps refer to ridem conservation development manual 2003 topography and slopes the form of the land is fundamental to understanding both natural systems and suitability for construction usgs topographic maps provide tenfoot contours elevation lines  these can be traced manually or digitized for use as an overlay in addition a slope map provides a general assessment of development suitability or potential hazards based on slope 13 ____________ existing topography with tenfoot contour lines 14 ____________ slope map with slopes grouped according to five categories based on development suitability 03 percent 38 percent 815 percent 1525 percent and over 25 percent steeper slopes should be shown in progressively darker colors or shades of gray 15 ____________ existing drainage and drainage structures such as culverts and pipes etc natural resource inventory unique features and local priorities for natural resources can be found in the comprehensive plan smaller parcels in particular may contain only a portion of a resource area or buffer zone which may be shown more clearly on a separate map showing the site within a larger district or watershed subsurface groundwater aquifers and surface water supplies should be indicated in a gradation of blue colors tones or hatching where the surface water supply reservoir or aquifer is darkest and its watershed or recharge areas are progressively lighter farmland and forested land should be shown in light and dark green respectively with an indication of underlying soil types with hatching andor labels natural heritage areas can be shown with a red outline around

identified in state and local plans and specific views on the parcel can be identified with arrows and text description 24 ____________ state or locally designated historic sites districts cemeteries or landscapes 25 ____________ archaeological sites 26 ____________ scenic road corridors and statedesignated scenic areas 27 ____________ approximate location of stonewalls structures outbuildings roads or trails and other historic features on the parcel recreational resource inventory trails and recreational areas can be identified based on site observation usgs maps and aerial photography

within the town trails should be graphically separated into existing solid line and potential dashed line and colored green for hiking red for biking blue for boating etc 28 ____________ existing hiking biking and bridle trails within and adjacent to site 29 ____________ boat launches lake and stream access points beaches and water trails 30 ____________ existing play fields and playgrounds adjacent to the site utilities and infrastructure if available utility information available on rigis is 14 years old and therefore lacking more recent extensions the comprehensive plan contains more recent maps of utilities and the town department of public works and public utility companies maintain the most uptodate records a quick field survey of manholes and utility poles can often provide a good approximation of available utilities 31 ____________ size and approximate location of public or private water lines 32 ____________ size and approximate location of public or private sewer lines 33 ____________ gas service 34 ____________ electrical service 35 ____________ telephone cable and other communication services 36 ____________ width and surfacing material of existing roads at access points step 2 site context map in step 2 attention shifts to whats around the site in the larger context of the neighborhood and town objective data is collected for natural cultural and recreational resource systems that surround the site as well as the social structure and visual character of the neighborhood the contextual analysis process is described in detail in section 56 and in section 54 step 2 of these regulations it can include many of the same features and resources mapped for the site analysis but this time with a focus on the area surrounding the site using 1997 rigis orthophotos or more recent aerial photography if available show the area within 1 or 2 miles of the site at a scale of one inch equals 400 feet outline the parcel boundary surrounding parcels tenfoot contours surface waters and wetlands from rigis may be overlaid with the photograph if available resources which extend over large areas such as public drinking water supply watersheds groundwater aquifers wellhead protection areas and agricultural districts may also be shown more effectively at the context scale than on the site analysis maps in step 1 a usgs map should be submitted with the parcel boundary outline this will show many key features surrounding the step 3 potential conservation areas based on the data mapped as part of the analysis of the site and its context in steps 1 and 2 respectively an assessment map of potential conservation areas shows that part of the site which must be protected by law that which cannot be built on because of physical constraints or which represents an important resource or neighborhood feature to be protected together these represent the most logical potential conservation areas while the first two steps consist of a straightforward inventory of resources opportunities and constraints for step 3 planners must reach a consensus about which areas have high value for conservation designation of potential conservation areas is described in detail in section 54 step 3 of these regulations graphic and coloring schemes as suggested below can help keep this information legible as the information is combined on the maps separate overlays may be required to illustrate more complicated situations but where possible try to keep these coverages on the same map nonbuildable areas land unsuitable for development is defined in section 12 of the zoning ordinance these areas shall be shown as follows 37 ____________ freshwater wetlands surface waters and vernal pools including local and state regulated setbacks surface waters can be mapped in blue with wetlands in bluegreen and setback lines in darker bluegreen 38 ____________ land located in any floodway 39 ____________ existing utility easements and power line rightofways 40 ____________ unique sites having historical archaeological or values protected by local state or federal regulations since soil conditions are fundamental both to natural resources and construction suitability the statewide soil survey available on rigis can yield an approximate idea of areas where construction will be difficult or impossible the soils data also shows where development may be most appropriate particularly for onsite wastewater treatment systems the applicant must show soils as a function of the soil properties not the individual soil type several ways of grouping and assessing soils have been prepared by state agencies to aid in this assessment rigis provides a grouping scheme based on water table slope bedrock and miscellaneous severe constraints the cooperative extension service at the university of rhode island has developed a grouping scheme based on hydrological characteristics from welldrained soils with a deep water table to hydric soils that are essentially wetlands a comparison of these methods may be found at the rhode island cooperative extensions web site wwwurieducewqmtprapidsscomphtml the extent of hazard or constraint will depend to some degree on local conditions and availability of public sewer and water etc items to be identified as potential conservation areas will therefore need to be identified in consultation with town staff or the planning board partially constrained areas 41 ____________ slopes in excess of 15 percent  can be mapped in yellow 42 ____________ 100year flood plains  can be indicated with blue crosshatching 43 ____________ hydric soils and soils with seasonal high water table less than 35 feet or slowly permeable hardpan soils  can be shown with orange crosshatching primarily a

contours surface waters and wetlands from rigis may be overlaid with the photograph if available after preapplication review the planning board may request that other resources be overlaid with the context map in order to better understand how the development will affect its surroundings this may be particularly important in showing how the site fits into surrounding ecological or cultural systems these may include regionally important surface or subsurface water supplies large streamwetland systems continuous blocks of forested land or extended areas in agricultural use step 3 potential conservation areas the preapplication review especially step 3 the designation of potential conservation and development areas will serve to focus the more detailed mapping of potential conservation areas during preliminary plan more detailed assessment of soils and slope constraints should be based on the specific character of the site and the type of development proposed conclusions about nonbuildable and partiallyconstrained areas of the site will thus be calibrated to fit the specific situation at a minimum the planning board and the applicant should agree as to the method for evaluating soil constraints using either the rigis suitability model or a soilhydrology scheme depending on site conditions at the same time the planning board can identify locations where

cultural resource areas can be shown in red transparent tones 51 ____________ recreational resources can be shown with solid and dashed lines hatching for areas and annotations as appropriate summary map a summary map should be prepared combining nonbuildable partially constrained and important resource areas into a single overlay the summary map represents a synthesis of the principal conclusions drawn from the previous maps it therefore serves as a record of what the applicant and the planning board agree are the areas which should be preserved as open space and likewise clearly identifies the areas most suited for development it also allows for an agreement on what areas of the site may need to be investigated in further detail either to better locate the edges of a sensitive resource

reflect logical boundary locations in the field such as drainages stonewalls and tree lines easements for utilities and trails are also set down to preserve access to important corridors if the best locations for lot lines are still unclear at the preliminary plan stage criteria or guidelines for their placement should be described depending on the size of individual lots building envelopes may be necessary to ensure that houses are built in the desired area of each lot this can take the form of a buildto line showing where the front wall of each house should be placed a limit of disturbance line showing the area that should not be altered or a building envelope zone within which the builder can vary the final location and orientation of the house and appurtenances 75 ____________ alternatives for location of lot lines 76 ____________ criteria or statement of design intent for locating lot lines 77 ____________ location of rightsofway utility or trail easements 78 ____________

from rigis may be overlaid with the photograph if available after preapplication review the planning board may request that other resources be overlaid with the context map in order to better understand how the development will affect its surroundings this may be particularly important in showing how the site fits into surrounding ecological or cultural systems these may include regionally important surface or subsurface water supplies large streamwetland systems continuous blocks of forested land or extended areas in agricultural use step 3 potential conservation areas the preapplication review especially step 3 the designation of potential conservation and development areas will serve to focus the more detailed mapping of potential conservation areas during master plan more detailed assessment of soils and slope constraints should be based on the specific character of the site and the type of development proposed conclusions about nonbuildable and partiallyconstrained areas of the site will thus be calibrated to fit the specific situation at a minimum the planning board and the applicant should agree as to the method for evaluating soil constraints using either the rigis suitability model or a soilhydrology scheme depending on site conditions at the same time the planning board can identify locations where fieldtesting of soils and water table will be necessary and the extent of such investigation required for the master plan submission nonbuildable areas 39 ____________ fresh water wetlands and surface waters including local

field surveys 47 ____________ cultural resource areas can be shown in red transparent tones 48 ____________ recreational resources can be shown with solid and dashed lines hatching for areas and annotations as appropriate summary map a summary map should be prepared combining nonbuildable partially constrained and important resource areas into a single overlay the summary map represents a synthesis of the principal conclusions drawn from the previous maps it therefore serves as a record of what the applicant and the planning board agree are the areas which should be preserved as open space and likewise clearly identifies the areas most suited for development it also allows for an agreement on what areas of the site may need to be investigated in further detail either to better locate the edges of a sensitive resource or to perform a more detailed survey of features which might be incorporated in the proposed development the summary map simplifies the previous overlays into three colors 49 ____________ nonbuildable areas  shown in red or red hatching 50 ____________ partiallyconstrained areas  shown in orange or orange hatching 51 ____________ important natural cultural

submission requirements for preliminary plan are determined by each town but should include the following as listed under section 452341 engineering plans depicting the existing site conditions engineering plans depicting the proposed development project a perimeter survey all permits required by state or federal agencies prior to commencement of construction including permits related to freshwater wetlands the coastal zone floodplains preliminary suitability for individual septic systems public water systems and connections to state roads preliminary plan review is thus concerned with the details of engineering and permitting necessary to ensure construction of the plans set down by the master plan barring surprises that turn up in more detailed surveys of the site the conclusions reached in master plan will not change much but they will need to be developed in more detail to explain exactly how each feature of the proposed development will be constructed under section 452344 state law lists requirements towns may adopt for physical design such requirements may include but shall not be limited to requirements and policies for rightsofway open space landscaping connections of proposed streets and drainage systems with those of the surrounding neighborhood public access to adjacent public property and the relationship of proposed developments to natural and manmade features of the surrounding neighborhood expands this list to include standards for public design and improvements including specifications for rightsofway streets sidewalks lighting landscaping public access utilities drainage systems fire protection and soil erosion control what these requirements and standards imply is that the focus on community context and the environment that was so important to the development of the design during preapplication and master plan should not be lost as the project proceeds into preliminary and final plan rather as each aspect of engineering and construction is worked out the master plan can and should continually be the basis of decision making and the means by which each of the various aspects of construction drainage and environmental protection are coordinated into a unified whole at the conclusion of master plan all ten steps of the conservation development design process have been completed the purpose of the preliminary plan stage is to do the detailed engineering and any remaining site analysis to determine that the master plan works if not done previously further site surveys may be required for a thorough assessment of whether there are additional natural or physical constraints such as vernal pools or presence of ledge that will require the master plan to be revised the following checklist repeats those elements of the master plan submission that are necessary to describe the basic information about the project and summarize existing conditions on the site the preliminary plan
