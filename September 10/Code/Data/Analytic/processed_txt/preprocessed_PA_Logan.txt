rental unit occupancy regulations  101 purpose and intent a it is the purpose of this the policy of the board of supervisors of the township of logan township in order to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare of its citizens to establish rights and obligations of owners and occupants relating to the rental of certain dwelling units and dormitory units in the township and to encourage owners and occupants to maintain and improve the quality of student rental housing within the community it is also the policy of the township that owners managers and occupants share responsibilities to obey the various codes adopted to protect and promote public health safety and welfare as a means to those ends this for a system of inspections issuance and renewal of occupancy licenses and sets penalties for violations this be liberally construed and applied to promote its purposes and policies although the board of supervisors of the township acknowledges the significant contribution that educational institutions their students faculty and staff make to the culture and economy of the township and surrounding area in recent years adverse effects of student housing on residential neighborhoods have increased and there has been an increase in destructive student behavior that threatens the health safety and welfare of the student citizens and nonstudent citizens of the township accordingly in considering the adoption of this the township makes the following findings a when compared to other unrelated cohabitating individuals and traditional families groups of students have different hours work and social habits and frequently cause noise disturbances and problems in residential neighborhoods b there is a greater incidence of violations of various codes of the township at residential properties where owners rent such property to students c there is a greater incidence of disturbances which adversely affect the peace and quiet of the neighborhood at residential properties where owners rent to students than at owneroccupied residential properties familyoccupied residential rental properties or residential properties that are occupied by unrelated persons who are not students d a concentration of student homes changes the character of a neighborhood from one with traditional family values to one that cannot maintain those  and most of the townships student homes are concentrated in the juniata gap and grandview areas of the township which displaces middle and lowerincome housing by absorbing housing units and rendering the remaining units less desirable for moretraditional residential use  101 administration and government  101   102 definitions a for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this the following words shall

development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams d the use of green infrastructure and lowimpact development lid are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to 1 infiltrate and recharge  2 evapotranspire  andor 3 harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth green infrastructure practices and lid contribute to the restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge
