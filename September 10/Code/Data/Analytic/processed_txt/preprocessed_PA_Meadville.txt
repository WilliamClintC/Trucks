iconversion of concentration limits when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the owner convert the limits to equivalent mass loading limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass loading limits is within the discretion of the owner the owner may establish equivalent mass loading limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions in subsections i1a e of this section 1to be eligible for equivalent mass loading limits the industrial user must aemploy or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism  bcurrently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  cprovide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  dnot have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and ehave consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass loading limits 2an industrial user subject to equivalent mass loading limits must amaintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass loading limits  bcontinue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  ccontinue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the owner whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection i1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the owner must reassess the equivalent mass loading limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and dcontinue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection i1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass loading limit 3an owner which chooses to establish equivalent mass loading limits amust calculate the equivalent mass loading limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  bupon notification of a revised production rate must reassess the equivalent mass loading limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and cmay retain the same equivalent mass loading limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass loading limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to mmc 91211 the industrial user must also be in compliance with 40 cfr 40317 regarding the prohibition of bypass 4the owner may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as ph temperature radiation or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass jequivalent limitations once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived kuse of production or flow figures many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation lproduction changes any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass loading or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased categorical pretreatment standard shall notify the owner within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the owner of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass loading or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate mannual certification by nonsignificant categorical industrial users a facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial user pursuant to mmc 91204kk must annually submit the following certification statement signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative of the user this certification must accompany any report required by the owner based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for

prohibitions in mmc 91205b3 7 and b9 14 and 16 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either aa local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or bno local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the owner was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 132 2012   91264 bypass afor the purposes of this section 1bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams

anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the owner may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours dbypass 1bypass is prohibited and the owner may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless abypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  bthere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and cthe user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2the owner may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the owner determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection d1 of this section 133 2012   91265 reservation of rights

known and may be cited as the city of meadville stormwater management    94102 statement of findings the governing body of the city of meadville finds that ainadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources ba comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of meadville and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment cinadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge dstormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality epublic education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues ffederal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system
