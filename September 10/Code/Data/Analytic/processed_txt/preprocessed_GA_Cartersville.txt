urine specimen collection collector a collector is a trained individual who instructs and assists a donor at a collection site and makes an initial inspection of the urine specimen provided by a donor and initiates and completes the federal drug testing custody and control form ccf any individual who has received training in conducting the required collection procedure may serve as a collector except in the following situations a the direct supervisor of a particular employee you may not act as the collector when that employee is tested unless is no feasible alternative  or b an individual working for an hhscertified drug testing laboratory may not act as a collector if that individual can link the employee with the specimen drug test result or laboratory report to allow such an individual to collect such a specimen would compromise the confidentiality of the employees test result a collector should have appropriate identification the collector is required to provide his or her identification or collection company identification if requested by the donor there is no requirement for the collector to have a picture id or to provide his or her drivers license with an address also the collector is not required to provide any certification or other documentation to the donor proving the collectors training in the collection process note although not required it would benefit the collector to have the agency representatives name and telephone number to call if an unusual situation arises during the collection process collection site a collection site is a facility permanent or temporary where a donor provides a specimen for a drug test a collection site must have 1 a restroomstall with a toilet for the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen the presence of a toilet is not absolutely necessary when a singleuse collection container is used that has sufficient capacity to contain the entire void whenever available a single toilet restroom is preferred all types of restrooms including a mobile facility eg a vehicle with an enclosed toilet are acceptable 2 a source of water for washing hands that if practical is external to the restroomstall where urination occurs if a water source is not available providing a moist towelette outside the restroomstall is an acceptable alternative 3 a suitable clean surface for the collector to use as a work area note the collectors work area must be located outside the restroom however if there is no appropriate space available outside the restroom to serve as a secure clean work area and the restroom is large enough to accommodate a work area the work area may be located inside the restroom as long as the donor has privacy while providing a urine specimen and the collector is the same gender as the donor 4 security features to prevent unauthorized access to the site during the collection 5 features to prevent the donor or anyone else from gaining unauthorized access to the collection materialssupplies the collector must ensure that the donor does not have access to items that could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen eg soap disinfectants cleaning agents water 6 features to provide for the secure handlingstorage of specimens from collection until shipment collection supplies the following items must be available at the collection site to conduct proper collections 1 singleuse plastic collection containers each collection container must be individually sealed using a tamperevident system such as sealed plastic bag shrink wrap or another easily visible tamperevident system be large enough to easily catch and hold at least fiftyfive 55 ml urine and have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of fortyfive 45 ml and above 2 singleuse plastic specimen bottles each specimen bottle with cap must be sealed using a tamperevident system such as sealed plastic bag shrink wrap or another easily visible tamperevident system be large enough to hold at least thirtyfive 35 ml or they may be two 2 distinct sizes of specimen bottles providing that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least thirtyfive 35 ml of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least twenty 20 ml have screwon or snapon caps that prevent leakage have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels thirty 30 ml for the primary specimen and fifteen 15 ml for the split specimen of urine to be poured into each bottle be designed so that the required tamperevident bottle labelseal on the ccf fits with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with chance that seal overlap would conceal printed information and be leak resistant note two 2 specimen bottles with caps may be sealed together using a single tamperevident system such as shrink wrap because two 2 specimen bottles are always needed for split specimen collections 3 temperature strips temperature strips capable of indicating temperature readings between 90e100ef or 32e38ec the temperature strips may either be affixed to the collection container as supplied or be affixed to the collection container after the donor gives the specimen collection container to the collector 4 federal drug testing custody and control forms federal drug testing custody and control forms ccf approved by the office of management and budget omb 5 tamperevident seals occasionally the tamperevident labelseal provided with the ccf will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions eg moisture temperature specimen bottle material if this occurs the collector should have a separate tamperevident labelseal that can be used to seal the specimen bottle 6 leakresistant plastic bags the plastic bag must have two 2 sealable compartments or pouches ie one 1 large enough to hold two 2 specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the ccf 7 absorbent material the absorbent material is placed with the specimen bottles inside the leakresistant plastic bag in case a specimen bottle leaks during shipment note the use of absorbent material is required by the us postal service and other express carriers when shipping biological materials 8 shipping containers boxes or bags that are used to transport specimens to the laboratory and can be securely sealed to prevent the possibility of undetected tampering a shipping containermailer is not necessary if a laboratory courier handdelivers the sealed leakresistant plastic bags containing the specimen bottles directly from the collection site to the laboratory 9 bluing agent the bluing agent is added to the toilet bowlwater tank to prevent a donor from diluting the specimen 10 secure temporary location if the sealed leakresistant plastic bag containing the specimen bottles is not immediately placed in a shipping container the sealed plastic bag must always be maintained within the line of sight of the collector to ensure that no one has access to the specimen until it is placed in a shipping container or it must be placed in a secured temporary location eg inside a refrigerator that can be secured inside a cabinet that can be secured if the collector always places the sealed plastic bags immediately into shipping containers there is no need to have a secure temporary location available at the collection site 11 disposable gloves hhs recommends that collectors use single use disposable gloves while handling specimens the occupational safety and health administration has specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who are exposed to potentially infectious body fluids 29 cfr  federal drug testing custody and control form all urine specimens must be collected using chain of custody chain of custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling and storage of a specimen from the time a donor gives the specimen to the collector to the final disposition of the specimen for specimens collected under the mandatory guidelines the office of management and budget omb approved federal drug testing custody and control form ccf must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection site the ccf is available from a number of different sources eg laboratories collectors mros although it is usually provided by the laboratory a sample of the ccf omb no 09300158 exp date  is on the samhsa web site wwwhealthorgworkplhtm all discussions throughout this revised handbook refer to this version of the ccf form the ccf consists of the following five 5 copies copy 1 laboratory copy copy 2 medical review officer copy copy 3 collector copy copy 4 employer copy copy 5 donor copy copy 1 accompanies the specimen to the testing laboratory copy 2 is sent to the mro copy 3 is retained by the collector copy 4 is sent to the employer and copy 5 is given to the donor the ccf is completed as follows step 1  this step is completed by the collector or employer representative the employer name and address and the mro name and address may be preprinted or handwritten the collector will normally enter the donors social security number after verifying the donors identity the collector also marks the appropriate box to indicate the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed the collector then enters the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed the collector then enters information required for the collection site step 2  this step is completed by the collector after receiving the specimen from the donor and measuring the temperature of the specimen this step requires the collector to mark the appropriate box to indicate if the temperature of the specimen was within the required temperature range  but also requires the collector to indicate whether it is a split specimen or single specimen collection to indicate if no specimen was collected and why or to indicate if it was an observed collection and why step 3  this step instructs the collector to seal the specimen bottles have the donor initial the bottle seals and then instruct the donor to complete step 5 on the mro copy copy 2 step 4  this step initiated by the collector and then completed by the laboratory after the specimen is accessioned by the laboratory this step requires the collector to only sign the form once to certify that the specimen was collected labeled sealed and released for shipment to the laboratory in accordance with federal requirements the collector is also required to note the time of the collection the date of the collection and the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen is released for shipment to the laboratory note there is no requirement for couriers express carriers or postal service personnel to document chain of custody for the specimens during transit because they do not have access to the specimens or the ccf chain of custody annotations resume when the shipping containerpackage is opened and an individual at the laboratory has access to the specimen bottles and the ccf at the laboratory the accessioner is required to document the condition of the primary specimen bottle seal sign the ccf print hisher name record the date the specimen was accessioned and indicate to whom the specimen was released the entry for the specimen bottles released to may include transfer to temporary storage or transfer to another individual after this transfer chain of custody of the specimen bottles is documented by the laboratory on an internal chain of custody form step 5a  this step is completed by the laboratory to document the test results on the primary specimen step 5b  this step is completed by the laboratory to report the split specimen result if the split specimen is tested the bottom area of copy 1 is reserved for the tamperevident specimen bottle seals there must be two 2 labels ie one 1 marked with the letter a to designate the primary specimen and the other marked with the letter b to designate the split specimen to accommodate collecting split specimens and each must have the same preprinted specimen identification number that appears at the top of the ccf each label must also have a place for the collector to annotate the date of the collection and a place for the donor to initial each label after it is placed on the specimen bottle if a single specimen collection procedure is used the second label ie the b label is discarded by the collector donor identification the donor must provide appropriate identification to the collector upon arrival at the collection site acceptable forms of identification include 1 a photo identification eg drivers license employee badge 2 identification by an agency representative  or 3 any other identification allowed under an agencys workplace drug testing plan unacceptable forms of identification include 1 identification by a coworker  2 identification by another donor  or 3 use of a single nonphoto identification card eg social security card credit card union or other membership cards pay vouchers voter registration card collection procedure the following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the mandatory guidelines step 1 the collector prepares the collection site to collect urine specimens all collection supplies must be available the area properly secured water sources secured and bluing agent placed in all toilets note if access to a water supply in the restroom cannot be controlled the collector may tell the donor that he or she will be listening at the entrance to the restroom for any sounds associated with the donor attempting to use the available sources of water alternatively the collector may enter the restroom with the donor if the collector is the same gender as the donor but remains outside the toilet stall 2 the collector begins the collection without delay after the donor arrives at the collection site note do not wait because the donor is not ready is unable to urinate or an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving 3 the collector requests the donor to present an acceptable form of identification as described in note if the donor cannot satisfy the identification requirement the collector may proceed with the collection if the donor can provide two 2 items of identification bearing his or her signature after the donor signs the certification statement the collector should compare the donors signature with signatures on the identification that was presented if the signatures match the collector lists on the remarks line the two 2 items of identification used to identify the donor and states that signature identification was confirmed the collector then continues with the collection process if the signature does not match the signatures on the two 2 items of identification presented the collector should state on the remarks line that signature identification is unconfirmed discontinue the collection and notify the collection site supervisor and the agency note in situations where the donor does not have either photo identification or two 2 other appropriate items of identification that could be used to verify identity and signature this should not be automatically considered refusal to test the collector should proceed with the collection the collector should provide sufficient information on the remarks line to help the mro and the agency make a determination regarding the validity of the specimen and the collection process note if the donor asks the collector to provide identification the collector must show the donor some form of identification it must include the collectors name and the employers name address and telephone number it does not have to be a picture identification or include a home address and telephone number 4 the collector reviews the instructions on the back of the ccf with the donor 5 the collector begins entering information andor ensures that the required information is provided at the top of the ccf the laboratory name and address and a preprinted specimen id number and in step 1 of the ccf employers name address and id number if applicable mro name address phone and fax number donor ssn or employee id number reason for test drug test to be performed collection site information note a specific mros name and address must appear on the form rather than the name of the clinic or medical facility 6 the collector asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer clothing eg coat jacket hat etc and to leave any briefcase purse or other personal belongings he or she is carrying with the outer clothing the donor may retain his or her wallet note the donor must not be asked to remove other articles of clothing such as shirts pants dresses or under garments additionally the donor must not be requested or required to remove all clothing and wear a hospital or examination gown 7 the collector directs the donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items to ensure that no items are present that could be used to adulterate the specimen if nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen the donor places the items back into the pockets and the collection procedure continues note if an item is found that appears to have been brought to the collection site with the intent to adulterate the specimen a direct observed collection procedure is used if the item appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site secure the item and continue with the normal collection procedure 8 the collector instructs the donor to wash and dry his or her hands preferably under the collectors observation and must not wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to the collector note the donor must not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulteratedilute the specimen 9 the collector either gives the donor or allows the donor to select the collection container from the available supply either the collector or the donor with both present then unwraps or breaks the seal of the collection container note do not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time note do not allow the donor to take anything except the collection container into the room used for urination 10 the collector directs the donor to go into the room used for urination provide a specimen of at least fortyfive 45 ml split specimen collection or thirty 30 ml single specimen collection not to flush the toilet and return with the specimen as soon as possible after completing the void note the donor is always permitted to provide a specimen in private unless a direct observed collection has been authorized note pay close attention to the donor during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to substitute or adulterate a specimen if you detect such conduct immediately begin a new direct observed collection using a second ccf provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line in step 2 on the first ccf and submit it along with the specimen to the laboratory for testing this will ensure that the laboratory knows that two 2 separate specimens are being submitted for testing  the first one 1 possibly being adulterated or substituted additionally inform a supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so 11 after the donor hands the specimen to the collector the collector must measure the temperature of the specimen check the specimen volume and inspect the specimen for adulteration or substitution temperature check the temperature of the specimen within four 4 minutes after the donor hands you the specimen the acceptable temperature range is 32e38ec90e100ef temperature is determined by reading the temperature strip originally affixed to or placed on the outside of the collection container after the donor hands you the specimen 1 if the temperature is within the acceptable range the yes box is marked in step 2 on the ccf and the collector proceeds with the collection procedure 2 if the temperature is outside the acceptable range the no box is marked in step 2 on the ccf and the collector immediately begins a direct observed collection procedure using a second ccf the original specimen is sealed and sent with the first ccf to the laboratory with an appropriate comment on the remarks line to indicate that a direct observed specimen was also being collected and submitted to the laboratory specimen volume check to make sure that the specimen contains a sufficient amount of urine ie thirty 30 ml for a single specimen collection fortyfive 45 ml for a split specimen collection a single specimen collection if the volume is less than thirty 30 ml the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable range 1 if the temperature is in the acceptable range the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected the collector may use the same ccf for the second specimen but must use a new specimen collection container if the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty 30 ml of urine for the second specimen collected the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken 2 if the temperature is outside the acceptable range a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing the collector must use a separate ccf for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each ccf to indicate why two 2 specimens were collected if the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty 30 ml of urine for the second specimen collected the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken note in either case when a second specimen is to be collected hhs permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine whichever occurs first b split specimen collection if the volume is less than thirty 30 ml the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range 1 if the temperature is in the acceptable range the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected the collector may use the original ccf for the second specimen but should use a new specimen collection container if the donor fails to provide fortyfive 45 ml for the second specimen collected the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen collection with an appropriate comment on the remarks line on the ccf 2 if the temperature is outside the acceptable range a second specimen is collected under the direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing the collector must use a separate ccf for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each ccf to indicate why two 2 specimens were collected if the donor fails to provide fortyfive 45 ml for the second specimen collected the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection regardless of the volume collected with an appropriate comment on the remarks line on the ccf note in either case when a second specimen is to be collected hhs permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine whichever occurs first c split specimen collection if the volume is between thirty 30 and fortyfive 45 ml the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range 1 if the temperature is in the acceptable range all of the urine should be poured into one 1 specimen bottle bottle a bottle a is sent to the laboratory along with the ccf the collector should provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line on the ccf that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split bottle b specimen the donor forfeits the use of a split specimen collection procedure 2 if the temperature is outside the acceptable range a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing the collector must use a separate ccf for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each ccf to indicate why two 2 specimens were collected if the donor fails to provide fortyfive 45 ml for the second collection the second specimen is submitted as a single specimen collection and the collector should provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line on the ccf that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split bottle b specimen the donor forfeits the use of split specimen collection procedure note hhs permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine whichever occurs first adulteration or substitution inspect the specimen for unusual color presence of foreign objects or material or other signs of adulteration eg if you notice any unusual odor if it is apparent from this inspection that the donor has adulterated or substituted the specimen eg the specimen is blue exhibits excessive foaming when shaken has smell of bleach a second collection using direct observation procedures is conducted the first specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation are both sent to the laboratory for testing the first specimen is always sent to the laboratory even though it may have had an insufficient volume for either a single or split specimen collection if the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection regardless of volume and provides appropriate comments on the remarks line on both ccfs note when a second specimen is to be collected hhs permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine whichever occurs first note under no circumstances is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two 2 separate voids 12 the sealed specimen bottle is then unwrappedopened in the donors presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector the collector or the donor may unwrapopen the specimen bottle note there will be two 2 specimen bottles to be unwrappedopened if a split specimen was collected note both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the labelseal is placed over the specimen bottle caplid 13 the collector pours the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle places the lidcap on the bottle and uses the a bottle tamperevident labelseal the b bottle label is discarded if a split specimen collection procedure is used the collector pours thirty 30 ml of urine into a specimen bottle places the lidcap on the bottle and uses the a bottle labelseal the collector then pours the remaining urine at least fifteen 15 ml into a second bottle places the lidcap on the bottle and uses the b bottle labelseal note the tamperevident labelseal must be placed over the lidcap to ensure that the lidcap cannot be removed without destroying the labelseal the donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottles 14 the collector writes the date on the tamperevident labelsseals the donor is requested to initial the tamperevident labelsseals note occasionally the tamperevident labelseal provided with the ccf will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions eg moisture temperature specimen bottle material when this occurs the collector should still apply the tamperevident labelseal provided with the ccf and then apply a second separate tamperevident seal to seal the specimen bottle this second seal should be placed perpendicular to the ccf labelseal to avoid obscuring information on the ccf labelseal this second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor ie if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the ccf labelseal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle  however a labelseal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle but after several minutes the labelseal begins to lift off along the edges the collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line ccf step 2 stating why the second seal was used note if while sealing and initialing the ccf labelseal the collector or donor accidentally breaksdamages the seal the collector must apply a second separate tamperevident seal to seal the specimen bottle this second seal should be placed perpendicular to the ccf labelseal to avoid obscuring information on the ccf labelseal this second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor the collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line ccf step 2 stating why the second seal was used note since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamperevident tape and does not have to be under the donors direct observation the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so 15 the donor reads the certification statement on copy 2 of the ccf step 5 signs and dates the certification statement provides date of birth printed name and day and evening contact phone numbers note if the donor refuses to sign the form the collector must make a notation on the remarks line to that effect otherwise without the collectors comment a ccf without the donors signature could result in a canceled test the same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the labels 16 the collector completes the chain of custody on the ccf step 4 by printing his or her name signing where indicated recording the date and time of the collection and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottles are being released 17 the collector removes copy 5 from the ccf and gives it to the donor the donor may now leave the collection site note at this time the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and overthecounter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy copy 5 of the ccf but not on any other copy this information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the mro 18 the collector places the specimen bottles and copy 1 of the ccf inside the appropriate pouches of the leakresistant plastic bag seals the pouches and initials and dates the seal 19 the collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container eg express carrier mailer and seals the shipping container as appropriate note if a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container the collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container note the collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible the same day preferably 20 the collector sends copy 2 to the mro and copy 4 to the employer copy 3 is retained by the collector the collection procedure is now complete shy bladder procedure when a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen the donor may have intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site could not provide a specimen as directed by the collector has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a specimen or has a shy bladder the term shy bladder usually refers to an individual who is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby during the attempted urination if a donor tells the collector upon arrival at the collection site that he or she cannot provide a specimen the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless of the reason given at the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor unwrapopen a collection container the does the following 1 requests the donor to try to provide a specimen note the donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container 2 directs the donor to drink some fluids note the donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine whichever occurs first note the donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process note if the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine specimen the collection procedure is discontinued and a refusal to test is noted on the remarks line of the ccf 3 instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen the collector uses the ccf from the first attempt note it is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one 1 additional attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts 4 maintains a record of the time of each attempt whether there was no specimen provided or the quantity of specimen provided and the total ounces of fluid given to the donor 5 discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was used for the void but retains the ccf note if there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt the collection container may be used for the next attempt 6 discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a potential shy bladder situation if after a period of three 3 hours ie from the time the donor first demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen the donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen 7 indicates shy bladder on the remarks line of the ccf and attaches a copy of the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen copy 1 is discarded since no valid specimen was collected and the other copies of the ccf are distributed as appropriate if the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection regardless of the volume and provides appropriate comments on the remarks line on both ccfs note when a second specimen is to be collected hhs permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably period of up to three 3 hours or until the donor has

employer copy 3 is retained by the collector the collection procedure is now complete direct observed collection a direct observed collection procedure is the same as a routine collection procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor urinate into the collection container the use of an observer may occur only when 1 a previous drug test was reported either positive for a drug dilute adulterated substituted unsuitable for testing or canceled because the split specimen was not tested  2 the drug test is a returntoduty or a followup test  3 the agencyemployer believes that the donor may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided  or 4 during a routine collection the temperature of the specimen collected is outside the acceptable range the collector observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct indicated a possible attempt to adulterate or substitute a specimen or the collector believes that the specimen has been adulterated eg the specimen is blue exhibits excessive foaming when shaken has smell of bleach note the observer must be the same gender as the donor even if the observer has a medical backgroundtraining the collector may serve as the observer when the collector is the same gender as the donor if not the collector must call upon another individual who is the same gender as the donor to act as the observer note with regard to chain of custody the observer must never touchhandle the collection container after the donor has completed urinating into the collection container the donor and observer leave the enclosed toilet stallrestroom and the donor hands the collection container directly to the collector note the observer must maintain visual contact of the collection container until the donor hands the container to the collector note if the observer and collector are one 1 and the same the collector may receive the collection container from the donor while they are both in the enclosed toilet stallrestroom the collector continues with the collection procedure checks the box for an observed collection in step 2 on the ccf and provides the name of the observer and the reason for an observed collection on the remarks line in step 2 on the ccf a separate sheet explaining the use of an observed collection may be attached to the ccf if there is insufficient room on the remarks line blind samples each federal agency is required to have some blind samples negative and positive spiked samples submitted along with the donor specimens the blind samples are either purchased by the agency and given to the collector or the collector third party administrator or mro purchases the blind samples from a supplier and submits the blind samples along with agencys donor specimens a blind sample is always submitted using the same ccf as that used for a donor specimen the collector provides the required information to ensure that the ccf has been properly completed as well as providing fictitious initials on the specimen bottle labelseal since there is no donor the collector must indicate that the sample is a blind sample on the mro copy where the donor would normally provide a signature step 5 on copy 2 of the ccf note for a blind sample copy 5 of the ccf the donor copy may be discarded by the collector note if a federal agencyemployer collects split specimens for its workplace drug testing program the blind samples must also be submitted as split specimens documentation errorsfatal flaws when an hhs certified laboratory receives a specimen bottles and its associated ccf it checks to see if the specimen id number on the specimen bottle labelseal matches the number on the ccf that the specimen bottle seal is intact and that the ccf has been properly completed by the collector if there is any discrepancy andor error of omission eg the collector did not sign the chain of custody the collector did not check one 1 of the specimen temperature boxes the laboratory will contact the collector to determine if the discrepancy andor missing information can be recovered that is the collector can provide a written memorandum attesting to the fact that he or she did actually carry out the required action but inadvertently forget to properly document the ccf note if a memorandum cannot be provided by the collector to recover the discrepancy or error of omission the laboratory will report rejected for testing to the mro and provide an appropriate comment as to why the specimen was not tested note once contacted by the laboratory the collector should immediately respond to the laboratory indicating whether it can or cannot provide a memorandum to recover the discrepancy andor error of omission hhs recommends that laboratories retain these specimens for a minimum of five 5 business days before they may be discarded regulated and nonregulated employers federal agencies and employers regulated by the department of transportation dot are required to use the omb approved federal drug testing custody and control form for their workplace drug testing programs all other employers private sector companies states department of justice programs and the nondot testing conducted by dot regulated employers are considered nonregulated with respect to complying with the hhs mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs or the dot workplace drug and alcohol testing programs and are prohibited from using the federal ccf in the rare instance where the collector either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances eg postaccident test with insufficient time to obtain the ccf uses a nonfederal form for a regulated collection the use of a nonfederal form does in and of itself present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for the mro to cancel the test however if the laboratory or the mro discovers the use of the incorrect form a signed statement must be obtained from the collector stating the reason why the federal ccf was not used for the regulated collection cartersville gas system drug testing waiver and consent form i

fellow employee has such a problem notify your supervisor or the alcohol program manager whose name is listed in appendix a of this procedure  111705 who must be tested as of  any employee who would perform an operating maintenance or emergency response function on a pipeline is subject to alcohol testing under federal regulations the persons holding any position listed in appendix a of this procedure are considered covered employees and are subject to alcohol testing an employee who prior to notification of testing for alcohol misuse that has notified his supervisor that he has an alcohol problem will not be allowed to perform the duties of a covered employee the system at its discretion may send the employee to a substance abuse professional  111705 when testing must occur a alcohol testing must be performed on four 4 occasions 1 when there has been an accident postaccident testing 2 when there is reasonable suspicion that one 1 or more alcoholaffected employees may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance reasonablesuspicion testing 3 when an employee returns to duty after engaging in prohibited conduct returntoduty testing 4 following the return to work of a covered employee who has received assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse followup testing the covered employee will be subject to a reasonable program of followingup testing without prior notice for up to sixty 60 months after his or her return to duty b the requirements for each type of testing are as follows 1 postaccident testing a following an accident as defined in the definition section of this procedure the system will promptly test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employees performance contributed to the accident b the decision not to administer an alcohol test under this section will be based on the systems determination using the best available information at the time of the determination that the employees performance could not have contributed to the accident c each employee involved is required to submit to an alcohol test within two 2 hours of the accident if a test is not administered within eight 8 hours following the accident the system will stop trying to conduct an alcohol test and will prepare and keep on file a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted d an employee

to submission to an alcohol testmay be deemed to have refused to submit to testing e the employee must remain available for alcohol testing and may not consume any alcohol for eight 8 hours following the accident or until the alcohol test has been conducted employees should however seek and obtain emergency medical care whenever necessary 1 reasonablesuspicion testing a reasonablesuspicion testing is designed in conjunction with supervisor training on the signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse to identify alcoholaffected employees who may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance employees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their safety or productivity supervisors will make a decision as to whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is using or has used alcohol b a determination by the system that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists and to require a covered employee to undergo an alcohol test will be based on specific stated observations concerning the appearance behavior speech or body odors of the employee at the time the required observations will be made by a supervisor who has received at least sixty 60 minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse and will be documented c if a reasonablesuspicion test is not administered within two 2 hours following the determination the system will prepare and keep on file a record stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered if the required test is not administered within eight 8 hours of the determination the system will stop trying to administer an alcohol test and will state in the record the reason for not administering the test upon request such records will be made available to any person who has been delegated authority in the matter concerned d the system will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol as shown by the behavioral speech or performance indicators of alcohol misuse 3 returntoduty testing a if a substance abuse professional consulted in the case makes a determination that some form of evaluation andor treatment is required then the employee must comply with the recommended provisions in order to be considered eligible to returntoduty b before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct the system will ensure that the employee undergoes a returntoduty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 002 4 followup testing a following the determination that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse the employee will be subject to unannounced followup testing as directed by a substance abuse professional sap an employee who returns to duty will be subject to a reasonable program of followup testing without prior notice for up to sixty 60 months after his or her returntoduty b the employee will be subject to at least six 6 unannounced alcohol followup tests during the first twelve 12 months following his or her return to duty the sap assigned may terminate the requirement for followup testing any time after the initial six 6 tests have been completed if the sap makes the determination that such testing is no longer warranted c the system may require a covered employee to submit to alcohol followup testing when the sap assigned has reason to suspect alcohol involvement  111705

contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work the contractor shall request the final inspection the city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction the city inspector will not direct the actions of contractors workmen 4 concealed work the city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations pipe bedding tees bends service laterals or other appurtenances at the citys discretion the city may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling 5 minimum inspection by developer the following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer a horizontal location horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring asbuilt distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole b elevation and slope elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and redone 6 city inspection cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer a manhole construction manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes use of connecting boots use of joint material leakage proper invert construction proper setting of frame and cover b pipe straightness sewer line will be visually checked for straightness a passing section shall show at least eighty 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one 1 end any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked the section shall have water run sufficient to fill any sags that may exist then it shall have a television camera pulled to check for sags any sag holding more than one and onehalf inches 112 of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction the contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the citys approval to determine failing sections of sewers c infiltration the allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be one hundred 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe if any infiltration is present at the most downstream point then it will be measured using a speciallymade weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits d compaction of backfill compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned a minimum of two 2 tests per five hundred 500 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required if any of these tests show failing results then the failing backfill will be removed recompacted and retested and one 1 additional area will be tested as well 7 other testing requirements the tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city the city will be notified at least two 2 days prior to these tests a mandrel test for pvc pipe procedure for testing pvc sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows mandrel sized to ninetyfive 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter 1 completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel 2 during the final flushing of the line attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope line a nylon ski rope is recommended 3 after the rope is threaded line connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe 4 connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel this will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered 5 draw the mandrel sewer line 6 an increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection if this occurs mark the rope to note the location televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan subject to city approval for correcting the problem the contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the citys approval to determine locations of failing sewers 7 retest b air pressure test a low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks the following general procedures will apply also refer to astm specs 1 temporarily plug the line segment between two 2 manholes using plugs having air tight fittings low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested 2 introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches four and onehalf 45 psig above ground water pressure if any 3 wait at least five 5 minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than three and onehalf 35 psig above ground water pressure 4 bleed internal air pressure to exactly three and onehalf 35 psig above ground water pressure 5 accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to two and onehalf 25 psig above ground water pressure 6 the air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown on the following table pipe diameter in inches seconds per 100 feet of pipe pipe diameter in inches seconds per 100 feet of pipe 8 72 27 252 10 90 30 288 12 108 36 360 15 126 42 438 18 144 48 516 21 180 54 588 24 216 air leakage time is based on pipe being damp if pipe and joints are dry dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing and repeat operations until the city witnesses a successful test on each line segment upon request the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test if used the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two 2 feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to one hundred 100 gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe c manhole testing all manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test 1 exfiltration test manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration the minimum test time duration is one 1 hour manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring the maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two 2 gallonsfoot of depthfoot of manhole diameter 2 vacuum test vacuum testing of manholes for watertightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling after temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone a vacuum of ten 10 inches of mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off with valves closed the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of sixty 60 seconds at the end of the test period if the vacuum is nine 9 inches or greater

determined that the flood hazard areas of the city of cartersville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management water quality streambank protection stream corridor protection wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize damage to private property  3 minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and 4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public of the constitution of the state of georgia and ocga  36120a have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore cartersville georgia does ordain the ordinance codified in this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas it is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety as well as to private and public property floodplain management involves the designation of floodprone areas and the managing of their uses it is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams reducing flood hazards and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection as such floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts preserve greenspace and habitat and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality this article aims to help the county integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process the article requires that the county regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land use conditions which are based upon the communities adopted future land use map zoning or watershed study projections the ordinance also requires the county to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of one hundred 100 acres and greater in order to administer the ordinance futureconditions floodplains must be established 1 futureconditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one 1 square mile 640 acres and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction as required in the metropolitan north georgia water planning district districtwide watershed management plan cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten 10 percent of their area each year until futureconditions floodplains have been established for the entire community 2 for streams with a drainage area between one hundred 100 acres and six hundred forty 640 acres the local jurisdiction shall model and map the futureconditions floodplains or require the futureconditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant 3 for development projects in watersheds of any size where futureconditions floodplains have not yet been established the applicant will be required to determine the futureconditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article  3515 general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection streambank and stream corridor protection wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 limit the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  and 6 protect the stormwater management water quality streambank protection stream corridor protection wetland preservation

projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution therefore the city of cartersville has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff  81706 general provisions a purpose and

said zoning map and said overlay on said zoning map and said overlay shall be designated as the h1dbd historic district d design guidelines the following design guidelines are adopted for the downtown business historic district cartersville historic preservation commission downtown business district general guidelines part one general guidelines for structures contributing to the historic downtown business district preservation of characterdefining elements of historic buildings is a priority and alterations and repairs should accurately represent the historic qualities of the buildings original documentation should be used for restoration work wherever possible where original documentation is unavailable interpretations of similar elements that occurred in the area may be considered in filing for a certificate of appropriateness all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in your application for a coa maintenance recommendations are included for informational purposes only and are not to be included in an application for coa and as such shall not be considered by the commission in reviewing said applications 1 changes in use recommendation a change in use is not regulated but every reasonable effort should be made to provide a compatible use for the building that will require minimal alteration to the building and its site 2 original design character requirement respect the original design character of the building analyze the building to determine which elements are essential to its character do not try to make the building appear older or younger in style than it really is the genuine heritage of the historic downtown business district should be expressed 3 historical changes requirement preserve older alterations that have achieved historic significance in themselves examples would be an addition or entryway that was added to the original building early in its history more recent alterations that are not historically significant may be removed 4 plan and implement strategies requirement evaluate the historic property and establish a plan for implementing strategies for preservation rehabilitation restoration reconstruction alterations to the exterior and additions rehabilitation work should not destroy the distinguishing character of the property or its environment match the original material when feasible a substitute material is acceptable if the form and design of the substitute conveys the visual appearance of the original deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible patch piecein splice consolidate or otherwise upgrade the existing material using recognized preservation methods whenever possible if alternative materials must be used they should match the original in appearance as closely as possible replacement of missing architectural elements should be based on accurate duplications of original features in the event replacement is necessary the new material should match that being replaced in design color texture and other physical qualities the design should be substantiated by physical or pictorial evidence where reconstruction of an element is impossible because of lack of historical evidence a new design that relates to the building in general size scale and material may be considered using design elements that reflect the buildings style during repair or rehabilitation protect and maintain historic features that survive in generally good condition treatments include rust removal caulking sealing and repainting original materials and details that contribute to the historic significance of the structure should be preserved whenever feasible when disassembly of an historic element is necessary for its rehabilitation use methods that minimize damage to the original materials always devise methods of replacing the disassembled materials in their original configuration 5 roofs requirement preserve original pitch and shape of the roof forms where they contribute to the historic character of the building do not use shingled mansard roofs replace existing roof materials with the same type of material where it is visible from the street rooftop mechanical systems satellite dishes and microwave dishes should be unobtrusive and out of public view when possible maintain historic chimneys preserve historic skylights whenever possible do not remove ornamental roof features 6 cornices a cornice is the decorative strip along the top of most historic commercial buildings it caps off the facade physically and visually cornices are usually constructed of brick wood cast iron or sheet metal and occasionally the horizontal supporting beam itself ads as a cornice requirement whenever possible the original cornice should be preserved damaged cornices should be repaired without disturbing the rest of the cornice using similar materials 7 upper fronts requirement the upper front of a building is the section of the facade above the main storefront to assist in making a business look alive upper floors should appear occupied do not fill in upper windows a second story addition must be in keeping with the historical architecture of the building do not construct a front porch or balcony where none existed before 8 facades the basic commercial facade consists of two 2 main parts the storefront with an entrance and display windows  and the upper front usually with regularly spaced windows and a cornice at top of the building the storefront and upper front are visually important requirement the elements of the facade should be retained as closely as possible to those of the original structure using existing original materials whenever possible if parts of the facade are missing design and reconstruction should be based on historical pictorial or physical documentation when documentation is unavailable a new design for a missing element should be compatible with the size scale and material of the historic building 9 exteriors requirement do not paint coat or waterproof unpainted masonry do not sandblast exterior surfaces use the gentlest means possible to clean exterior materials when repainting brick use historic mortar mix softer than modern mixes matching the original mortar joints the stein building on west main street is a good example of this process maintain historic exterior materials repair as part of renovation damaged exterior materials with like materials and only in the area of damage do not use imitation brick or stone wood or metal siding or aggregates on the building facade recommendation maintain historic exterior materials repair as part of maintenance damaged exterior materials with like materials and only in the area of damage do not use imitation brick or stone wood or metal siding or aggregates on the building facade 10 storefronts common historic storefront design consists of large thinly framed windows and a recessed entrance frequently there is a cornice at the top of the storefront to separate it from the upper facade and low bulkheads at the base of the storefront to protect the windows and define the entrance requirement historic storefronts should be repaired rather than replaced or covered retain original elements such as bulkheads or cast iron columns storefronts can consist of a variety of materials but the overall image should be simple and unobtrusive using materials similar to those of the rest of the building if replacement of elements is required new materials should match the original in placement composition design texture and other visual qualities the frame can be wood cast iron or anodized aluminum bulkheads are generally wood panels aluminumclad plywood polished stone glass or tile where the original storefront no longer exists replacement should be based on historical research and physical evidence and be compatible with nearby historic building do not extend the storefront out of its place in the facade it should be in the same plane as the upper facade and not extend beyond the original opening retain transom windows reopening previously covered transoms whenever possible do not enclose replace the window type cover or install airconditioning units in transom windows 11 exterior details requirement details can be some of the most striking elements of a buildings facade since the design and size of many commercial buildings are quite similar their unique decorations should be noted and preserved subtle wood details as in window moldings should be retained do not add architectural details where none existed before such as colonial doors small windowpanes or storefront shutters decorative tile should be retained as should structural or pigmented glass such as beveled stained leaded and etched glass where they contribute to the original historic value during repair renovation or rehabilitation all decorative terra cotta and all forms of brick work and stonework should be repaired and maintained cast iron and sheet metal decorations common on many nineteenth century buildings should be preserved recommendation decorative terra cotta and all forms of brickwork and stonework should be repaired and maintained 12 windowsstorefront requirement retain the large display windows characteristic of commercial buildings in their original size shape and proportions and use original materials whenever possible preserve original window components replacing only damaged portions when replacing glass or restoring windows retain the original size and shape of the storefront opening display windows should use clear glass only  transom windows can be clear tinted or stained neither should have dividing mulls restore previously enclosed display windows when the original design is documented do not fill in window spaces or add storm windows which obscure the historic windows if dropped ceilings cover part of the window openings have the drop setback so the entire window space appears open from the outside interior window treatments should not change the overall character of the windows do not add merely decorative exterior shutters that do not fit the windows recommendation traditional storefronts are composed almost entirely of glass allowing natural lights to enter what is typically a long and narrow space that contains no other windows this storefront attracts business and should be well maintained 13 windowsupper front requirement existing windows should be repaired whenever possible using similar materials if required replacement windows should match the original in materials configuration and style and fill the entire opening if aluminum frame is used paint it to match the remaining windows storm windows should be either mounted inside or painted to match the window sash recommendation upper story windows help tie together all the facades on a street they give a building the appearance of vitality and should not be filled in or covered over if the space is vacant appropriate shades curtains or other interior window treatments should be used 14 awnings and canopies the canvas awning was an important design element common in the traditional storefront they help shelter passersby reduce glare and conserve energy by controlling the amount of sunlight that hits the store windows movable awnings can be retracted allowing the sun to shine into your building in the winter and can be extended to shade the storefront from summer heat awnings can also effectively and tactfully disguise inappropriate storefront alterations requirement there are a variety of materials for awnings including canvas vinylcoated canvas and the synthetic material carillon standard streetlevel awnings should be mounted between the display windows and the firstfloor cornice or sign panel with the valance about seven 7 feet above the sidewalk they should reinforce the frame of the storefront without covering up the side piers and should project four 4 to seven 7 feet from the building a twelveinch valance flap is usually attached at the awning bar and can serve as a sign panel canopies however especially large ones that are an integral part of the building may still be intact and should be preserved smaller canopies may benefit from the addition of a canvas over the rails and a twelve to twentyfourinch skirt along the front and sides recommendation since the average life of an awning is between four 4 and seven 7 years the only records of authentic awnings are old photographs or renderings unless they have been maintained regularly years always check any old photographs available for awnings on your building an awning can bring attention to your building but careful attention should be given to its design consider how it will appear in relation to the scale of your building to others on the street an intelligently designed and placed awning can save you money identify your storefront and create a nice sidewalk area for customers 15 entrances requirement retain original recessed entries where they exist use building symmetry to suggest location preferably recessed and canted retain tiled entryway floors on upper levels maintain historic door placements  do not add new entrances to secondary levels on the facade entrance doors on historical commercial buildings usually have a large clear glass panel and are made of wood steel or aluminum when restoring paint the frames a compatible color with the rest of the facade replacement doors should resemble the original in design and proportions retain doors hardware trim and the original number of doors and their locations do not install unfinished aluminum doors or residential doors do not add transoms or sidelights were none existed before 16 additions requirement additions should be placed away from public view at the rear of the building or well behind the facade maintain the form orientation and symmetry of the original structure create a discernible break at the juncture with the original structure walls of the addition should not be flush with the original structure ideally the addition should be able to be removed without substantial loss of historic materials and elements use matching or similar elements for style roofing siding and windows requirement parking lots should not be the main focus of the front of the building part two guidelines for new construction in historic downtown business district 1 building form and scale requirements any new building constructed in the historic downtown business district area will make a significant visual impact on the streetscape it is important to consider the character and scale of the surroundings and adjacent buildings to insure the new structure will be compatible new buildings should appear similar in mass and scale to historic structures in the area use building forms and roof forms that match those used historically any addition to an existing structure must also conform to the historic district building height should be comparable to adjacent structures where new building facades will be wider than those found traditionally subdivide the surface into promotions similar in scale to historic fades by varying setback roof forms and materials new construction should be sensitive to the size scale proportion material shape texture and rhythm of its neighbors 2 reconstruction requirements infill designs should not attempt to duplicate the period and style of the adjacent buildings or try to look old by using period proportions and materials the designs should complement the buildings in the area but represent the style of the period in which it is built when a contemporary depiction is required to understand and interpret a propertys historic value including the recreation of missing components in a historic district or site  when no other property with the same associative value has survived  and when sufficient historical documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction reconstruction may be considered as a treatment 3 building orientation and siteplacement requirements new buildings will respect the placement of nearby historic buildings by being placed at a setback equal to that of nearby similar historic buildings or similar buildings within the district it is required to align new buildings with the established setbacks of the area nontraditional lots can be given special consideration by the hpc buildings with party walls such as those along wall street main street public square and east church street under the bridge shall maintain zero lot line placement new buildings on these streets will not have side setbacks leaving gaps between adjacent buildings but will use party walls 4 entrance orientation requirement new construction will face the same street as nearby similar buildings respect traditional designs used for building entrances of similar buildings in the district using for example a recessed entrance where appropriate 5 windows requirement the size and proportion of window and door openings of a building should be similar to those on surrounding exemplary facades the same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole maintain the rhythm of the surrounding windows 6 materials requirement use building materials that are similar to those employed historically for all major surfaces brick stone and terra cotta may be used in unlimited quantities wood may be used on the first story storefront level for architectural elements such as pilasters cornices decorative raised panels etc but wood should not be used as a general siding material concrete block may be used in combination with other materials such as brick or stone concrete and precast concrete use is limited to architectural elements such as window hoods cornices columns and capitals glazed block or ceramic tile may be used as accent material only prohibited materials on building facades include metal aluminum or vinyl siding and preformed panels  porcelain or baked enamel metal panels  asphalt or wood shingles or siding new materials may be used if their appearances are similar to those of the historic building materials 7 plant beds and plantings requirement landscaping plans shall be approved by the dda design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the coa to the historic preservation commission hpc recommendation the goal is to beautify the district and make it more pleasant for pedestrian traffic locate plantings in traditional areas of the site such as along fences walks and foundations wellmaintained concrete planters that harmonize with nearby buildings and existing streetscape are recommended 8 walls and fences requirement the goal is to maintain the pattern of existing fencing in the historic downtown business district and to use fencing and walls to screen parking and storage areas maintain traditional fence lines or dominant fence lines in the vicinity new fence and wall designs must be appropriate for the primary structure and reinforce the pedestrian scale instead of forming barriers or exclusionary walls any fencing shall be approved by the dda design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the coa to the historic preservation commission hpc privacy fences should not be placed flush with the facade of a building recommendation new fences should limit their impact by being placed behind the rear elevation and by using traditional materials usually wood any obtrusive fence shall be further screened from public view by evergreen vegetation or a second traditional fence 9 pavement requirement historic walks and drives should be repaired rather than replaced if replacement is required new materials should match the original in placement composition design color texture and other visual qualities 10 parking lots requirement where placement of parking area is an option parking lots should not be the main focus of the site side or rear locations are required plan parking lots to be subdivided into small components so that the visual impact of large paved areas is reduced include islands of plantings in the interior of lots and provide planting buffers at the edges of parking lots new screening walls shall be used to limit the impact of parking on the district

coordinate the signs align several smaller signs or group them onto a single panel use similar forms or backgrounds for the signs to visually tie them together 13 additions requirement new additions should not obscure or confuse the essential form and character of the original building exteriors of additions to existing buildings should be compatible with the size scale material and character of the main building and its environment avoid new additions that would hinder the ability to interpret the design character of the historic period of the district site additions back from the building front so they will not alter the historic rhythm of building fronts when locating additions to historic buildings maintain the pattern created by the repetition of building fronts in the area locate additions so they will not obscure or damage significant ornamentation or detail avoid impacts to special moldings decorative windows or dormers generally additions should be sited to the side or rear of the original structure 14 demolition requirement before demolition submit a site plan to the commission illustrating proposed site development or plantings to follow demolition during demolition

formerly such sections pertained to similar provisions and derived from  purpose and findings a the purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed however it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish as to adult entertainment establishments this article represents a balancing of competing interests  reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighbors regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons b findings based on the

whitfield county georgia  carrollton georgia  smyrna georgia  rome georgia  and feet  lauderdale and palm beach florida which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city of cartersville georgia the mayor and city council takes note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country moreover it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the city limits and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow andor encourage nudity based on these findings this

article xiv  medical pharmacy pain management establishments purpose and findings a since the 1990s the abuse of prescription opioids has risen dramatically due in large part to the increase in the use of these analgesics to manage pain opioids are prescribed to alleviate pain ranging from moderate to severe as described by the patient these analgesics principally affect the nervous system suppressing the signlas of pain sent to the brain  examples of these medications can include but not be limited to morphine codeine oxycodone eg oxycontin percodan percocet and related drugs as opioids block the perception of pain they also have the affect of creating a state of euphoria which may be heightened when abused side effects can include drowsiness nausea constipation and respiratory constraint b opioids are recognized as very effective when taken as prescribed for legitimate pruposes post surgery for example as the national institute on drug abuse states many studies have shown that the properly managed shortterm medical use of opioid analgesic drugs is safe and rarely causes addiction  defined as the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs despite adverse consequences  or dependence which occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug and often results in withdrawal symptoms when that drug is reduced or stopped unfortunately opioids taken longterm can create physical dependency in some patients producing withdrawal symptoms when the medication is not taken cessation side effects can include bone pain insomnia and vomiting to name a few c since the tragic events of  the rise in the diversion of legal prescription drugs has grown exponentially due to increased security at the borders and ports amplified security has effectively reduced the supply of illegal drugs traditional smuggled by the drug trade necessitating the need to find alternative methods of supplying drugs to users  consequently legal prescription drugs are now

physicians prosecutors and many more stakeholders the report provides valuable information regarding the current state of this epidemic as well as recommendations to curtail this rapidly growing public safety concern f as broward county and other south florida jurisdictions struggle to eliminate pill mills this outbreak of illicit pain clinics crossed into other states notably georgia and texas in fact the cobb county prescription drug task force reports that in 200 8246 percent overdose deaths statewide involved pharmaceuticals going to 8511 percent in 2008 alprazolam hydrocodone and oxycodone were found to constitute the top five 5 substances involved in all of these overdose deaths alprazolam commonly known by the trade name xanax an anxiety medications is often combined and distributed with opioids at illegal pain clinics g illegal pain clinics commonly known as pill mills dispense large quantities of schedule ii iii and iv drugs for cash with little examination of the patient conducted scheduled drugs are dispensed at these establishments or prescriptions are written to be filled at a legitimate pharmacy often out of jurisdiction and outofstate license plates are in the parking lots of these clinics with individuals driving great distances to receive these prescriptions pill mills often hire security guards to handle unruly patients and perhaps even scout for law enforcement individuals seeking these services will often fake an ailment forging an mri or providing falsified medical documentation to receive prescriptions in turn the physicians conduct lackadaisical examinations of these individuals simply asking them what they want with regard to medication h the city of cartersville city council adopted a twelvemonth moratorium on the issuance of occupational tax certificates to pain management clinics on  to conduct the proper research and vetting to create a new ordinance and municipal pill mills after thorough research the city council has prepared these provisions to eliminate this rapidly emerging epidemic creating a new article in the the city of cartersville i not all pain clinics are pill mills thus the challenge of regulating this

mills are often owned operated and staffed by unlicensed proprietors with little or no medical training 4 pill mills masquerade as legitimate pain management establishments or medical providers but instead perform few if any medical examinations with often sparsely furnished offices and no typical medical equipment 5 pill mills operate on a cash basis usually not accepting checks credit cards or health insurance creating an environment that poses a security threat in light of the clientele seeking these illicit services 6 individuals seeking pill mill services often falsify symptoms or provide bogus documentation of an ailment to receive powerful schedule ii iii and iv drugs alternative methods of treatment physical therapy surgery etc are rarely ever proposed to a patient seeking services from a pill mill 7 individuals will often shop various pill mills receiving multiple prescriptions on the same day or during a short period of time thereafter reselling the pills to generate a profit to fund their own addiction and purchase additional supplies 8 dealers or groups of dealers often sponsor individuals who obtain schedule ii iii and iv drugs repeatedly over multiple pill mills during a short period of time these large quantities may then be resold at a much higher value to fund the purchase of larger quantities as well as to continue the abuse of these powerful drugs by the individuals involved 9 individuals seeking pill mill services will often be consuming these scheduled drugs as they search for the next pill mill these individuals may be under the influence of one 1 or more of these powerful drugs or suffering from withdrawal symptoms pill mills can usually supply scheduled drugs onsite for individuals to consume immediately as well both the influence of

3 to promote economic development  4 to improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs  5 to prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city

placement position and architectural qualities that further the distinct values of the city  7 to protect the public health safety and general welfare  8 to restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate over time all nonconforming signs  9 to ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards  and 10 to make it easier quicker and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit b findings this article was enacted with the following findings in mind 1 the city finds that signs are a proper use of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of such signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises 2 the city further finds that the regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens 3 the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going as such with the exception of signs identifying government buildings virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes moreover their use in the public rightofway is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public the city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations even where signs serve a propriety purpose such as identifying markings on utility poles those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally of locations where there may be temporary losses of power 4 the city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function for instance address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls while such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners  definitions words and phrases used in this article

there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection c below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and

opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails  prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 2483a of this article or the specific prohibitions in section 2483b3 18 excluding subsection b8 of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  bypass a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the superintendent may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d 1 bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there was no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2 the superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in subsection d1

sewer service fees the property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department f fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants bod tss cod may or may not be punitive as deemed by the city g fines for conventional pollutants bod tss cod can be waived provided no harm occurred to the potw at the discretion of the city on a casebycase basis h wastewater discharges between three hundred 300 mgl and six hundred 600 mgl of bod andor tss will be assessed a surcharge enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding six hundred 600 mgl the purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the potw to handle excess bod andor tss and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost 1 for samples with a difficult bod to measure accurately chemical oxygen demand cod may be substituted for bod analysis wastewater discharges between seven hundred fifty 750 and two thousand five hundred 2500 mgl of cod will be assessed a surcharge enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding two thousand five hundred 2500 mgl  division 15  miscellaneous provisions pretreatment

for complete derivation low pressure systems 1 preamble whereas the us environmental protection agency has found low pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands higher maintenance requirements and greater costs for homeowners  and whereas the mayor and city council deems it to be in the best interest of the citizens of the city of cartersville to adopt additional regulations governing low pressure systems and permissible residential systems in general now therefore be it ordained and it is hereby ordained by virtue of the authority vested in the city council by law that the following waste treatment ordinance be adopted 2 waste treatment ordinancepurpose it is the purpose of this section to regulate the available types of waste treatment options for individual uses in the city of cartersville the city of cartersville has experience with individual septic systems and traditional gravity flow systems and such systems are appropriate for the city under more limited circumstances private sewage facilities may be permitted the city of cartersville recognizes that the us environmental protection agency has found lowpressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands higher maintenance requirements and higher costs to the homeowner the city has further determined that the ongoing maintenance issues created by such systems lead to greater future problems than in a conventional gravity flow sewer system such systems have many more mechanical and powered parts and are therefore subject to much higher failure rates preventative maintenance requirements are higher and power outages can result in overflows and damage to residences life cycle replacement costs are higher than gravity sewers therefore this section is adopted to regulate and prohibit such systems in the interest of protecting the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of cartersville 3 definitions as used in this division words shall have their common meaning and significance except for the specifically defined terms below a effluent the flow of liquids and solids from a structures sewage plumbing system  eg human waste waste water etc b low pressure sewer system a sewer system that uses pressure to move the effluent from individual lots to the main sewer lines pressure sewers typically break down large solids in a pumping station located on an individual lost before they are transported collection system sewer mains to the treatment facility such systems include grinder pump systems and septic tank effluent pump systems systems which use a pumptopump waste from a septic tank to a septic field on the same lot are not included in this definition c low pressure sewer system cluster a pressure sewer system with a common lowpressure line that connects several residences by individual pumps to a central or common pump station d private sewage facility means a privately owned sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner e public sewage facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one 1 property owned by different owners examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners 4 regulation of waste treatment facilities a lowpressure sewer systems including low pressure sewer system clusters are prohibited in the city of cartersville individual residential lots are required to be connected to a public gravity flow sewer system b sewage treatment and handling systems for individual residential lots not otherwise covered or defined specifically by this section or as may be invested in the future shall only be permitted upon approval of the water superintendent the applicant shall submit an application as required by the city containing plans specifications and other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent the superintendent shall not permit systems or technologies that are unproven that increase the risks of environmental contamination that do not meet the standards contained in the city of cartersville ordinances or standards as may be adopted by the city of cartersville water department or other applicable ordinance that increase costs or burdens on the citys sewer system or to individual property owners or that are found to be a threat in any way to the health safety or welfare of the citizens of the city 5 interpretation it shall be the duty of the city of cartersville water superintendent to classify proposed systems if there is a question as to the type of system proposed or whether it is permitted or prohibited the superintendent shall make the final interpretation for the water department his determination may be appealed to

council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard the basis is that the city of cartersville nondemand electric rates are typically designed for differences in costincurrence attributable to seasonal time of use but not daily time of use due to the lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering electric demand rates are typically designed for differences in costincurrence attributable to customer demand and energy components of cost daily time of use options will likely be considered in the future as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed a power cost adjustment is applicable to all electric rates and is utilized to account for additional capacity added to meet peak demand relative to base demand and additional kilowatthours of electric energy delivered to electric consumers the power cost adjustment is reset when a new cost of service study is performed and these differences are included in the revised rates 2 declining block rates it is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard the basis is that the city of cartersville utilizes declining block electric demand rates and can demonstrate that cost of energy decreases as customer consumption increases due to assignment of generation greater than load however use of declining block demand rates may continue to be used even if costs do not decrease as consumption increases if it is determined to promote economic development or for other reasons 3 timeofday rates it is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard the basis is that the city of cartersville does not utilize time of day electric
