allocated for nonresidential purposes from the total square footage of lot area the remaining lot area will then be divided by 5000 square feet to determine the maximum number of dwelling units rounded down for example if a lot contains 50000 square feet of area and 8000 square feet is allocated for nonresidential uses the lot area available for calculating the maximum residential density is 42000 square feet 50000 minus 8000 then 42000 divided by 5000 produces 84 the maximum residential development density is thus 8 dwelling units g parking the development review board may decrease the

ordinance to amend the sewer capacity allocation ordinance adopted  the town of shelburne selectboard hereby ordains the town of shelburne sewer capacity allocation adopted  is hereby amended in its entirety to state sewer capacity allocation ordinance authority this ordinance is enacted pursuant to the authority of 24 vsa  3625 to authorize the town to allocate the capacity of municipal sewage treatment facilities in the town to establish a capacity waiting list when capacity is unavailable and to define the status of allocations of capacity which predate the adoption of this  purpose the town of shelburne town has made a significant public investment in improvements and increased capacity to the towns sewage treatment and disposal facilities plants and sewage collection and transmission system sewers in order to avoid the environmental damage and danger to the public health caused by limited or inadequate collection and treatment of wastewater this sewer allocation ordinance is adopted to ensure that the allocation of sewer capacity occurs in a manner which is consistent with the town plan subdivision regulations and zoning bylaws to sustain the available capacity over the projected life of the plants and to protect the public investment in the plants and sewers the town recognizes that the extension of sewer lines in a dispersed and unplanned pattern creates an additional burden on the town to maintain the sewers and plants creates an additional financial burden on the town and its citizens and reduces capacity by increasing inflow and infiltration this ordinance will serve to direct growth to areas most appropriate for the efficient provision of municipal sewer service definitions the following words will have the meanings below

in 24 vsa  35016 and 36013 the plants and sewers were upgraded and expanded based on a report entitled facilities planning report for wastewater pollution control and plant expansion prepared by webstermartin inc dated october 1996 the plants are operated in accord with a discharge permit as amended issued by the vermont department of environmental conservation department under authority granted in 10 vsa the town of shelburne selectboard shall serve as the board of sewage disposal commissioners board and is obligated by law to comply with conditions of that permit and to operate and

alleviate the problem provided that the following conditions are met 1 the failure has created a public health hazard as defined in 18 vsa  2 or has the potential for causing substantial environmental harm  2 all other possible solutions have been explored and found inadequate  and 3 there will be no additional connections to any sewer line extensions needed to solve the problem c additional allocation any structure located outside of the sewer service area which is connected to the sewers as of the effective date of this ordinance may be granted additional allocation under the same terms

commission to demonstrate exceptional design or to provide affordable housing or public amenities and which advance the objectives of the town of shelburne comprehensive plan this set aside amount shall only be allocated as specified in b 2 below c determination of three year capacity allocation and assignment to allocation categories the board shall determine the remaining capacity to be allocated within the three year capacity allocation by 1 subtracting the plant wastewater flow obtained from the latest state department of environmental conservation uncommitted reserve hydraulic capacity report from the permitted wastewater flow 2 subtracting the committed reserve obtained from the same report 3 less an estimate of the capacity needed for categories not subject to the three year capacity allocation and 4 less the ten percent set aside divided by the remaining number of years in the twenty 20 year plant life spans and multiply the result by three the board may consider

development site performance standards 22053a intent sustainable design and low impact development lid techniques are highly encouraged and in some cases required in the srfbod to achieve low net energy consumption reduced stormwater runoff and higher water quality reduced vehicle miles traveled in the srfbod and surrounding districts and support dark night skies high canopy tree cover and production of local food 22053b stormwater management 1 purpose the purpose of this section is a to promote stormwater management practices that maintain predevelopment hydrology design site development building design and landscape design techniques that infiltrate filter store evaporate and detain stormwater close to its source  b to protect water resources particularly streams lakes wetlands floodplains and other natural aquatic systems on the development site and elsewhere from degradation that could be caused by construction activities and postconstruction conditions  c to protect other properties from damage that could be caused by stormwater and sediment from improperly managed construction activities and postconstruction conditions on the development site  d to reduce the impacts on surface waters from impervious surfaces such as streets parking lots rooftops and other paved surfaces  and e to promote public safety from flooding and streambank erosion reduce public expenditures in removing sediment from stormwater drainage systems and natural resource areas and to prevent damage to municipal infrastructure from inadequate stormwater controls 2 applicability a these regulations apply to any land development within the srfbod where onehalf acre or more of impervious area exists or will exist on an applicants property or properties making up the project site b if the combination of new impervious area created and the redevelopment or substantial reconstruction of existing impervious surfaces is less than 3000 square feet then the application is exempt from requirements in this section c applications meeting the criteria set forth in a and not exempt under b must meet the requirements in b3 i if the area of the lot or lots being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed is less than 50% of the lots existing impervious area then only those portions of the lot that are being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed must comply with b3 new impervious area must meet the requirements of b3 ii if the area of the lot or lots that is being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed exceeds 50% of the lots existing impervious area then all of the lots impervious surfaces must comply with all parts of b3 new impervious area must meet the requirements of b3 3 stormwater best practices a the water quality volume wqv as defined in the vermont stormwater management manual for the lots impervious surfaces must not be allowed to leave the lot via overland runoff and must be reused or infiltrated using low impact development practices including but not limited to practices detailed in the shelburne low impact development guidance manual if it is not possible to infiltrate the volume of stormwater runoff specified in this section due to one or more of the constraints listed in subparagraphs i below then the wqv must be retained on the lot using other low impact development lid strategies and practices such as those detailed in the shelburne low impact development guidance manual or treated by stormwater treatment practices meeting the water quality treatment standard as described in the most recently adopted version of the vermont stormwater management manual constraints on infiltration recognized in these regulations include the following i seasonally high or shallow groundwater as defined in the vermont stormwater management manual  ii shallow bedrock as defined in the vermont stormwater management manual  iii soil infiltration rates of less than 02 inches per hour  iv contaminated soils  v the presence of a stormwater hotspot as defined in of the vermont stormwater management manual  vi other site conditions subject to the review and approval of the ao b the postconstruction peak runoff rate for the 1year 24hour 21 inch rain event must not exceed the existing peak runoff rate for the same storm event from the site under existing conditions prior to submittal of an application lid practices must be incorporated into the design as necessary to achieve the required runoff rate if constraints prevent the use of lid practices stormwater treatment practices detailed in the vermont stormwater management manual may be used to achieve the required post construction runoff rate 22053c sustainable landscaping and open space 1 natural landscaping a natural and contextsensitive landscaping with plants native to local climate and soil conditions are required in the srfbod these plants thrive naturally requiring less maintenance and irrigation than most hybrid or imported varieties b natural resource preservation and landscaping should be used to minimize the need for irrigation systems and improve planting longevity preserving existing wooded areas mature trees and natural terrain can give new developments a premium mature landscape appearance and provide residents with additional recreational amenities c plant materials should be selected for their form color and texture as well as solar soil and moisture requirements it is also recommended that native plants vegetation that grows naturally in particular climates or regions be used because of their performance site enhancement and lifecycle cost benefits 2 canopy and shade trees the broad use of street canopy trees in the srfbod is a simple and attractive solution to reducing heating and cooling needs for buildings and sites contains requirements for soil quality and volume that ensure that street canopy trees and other newly planted trees in the public realm can grow to a size where they provide substantial habitat stormwater management economic and other benefits when planted on the south and west sides of buildings shade trees keep buildings cool in summer and then drop their leaves during the cooler fall season allowing warming sunlight to reach sidewalks and buildings additionally they create a lush canopy in the warmer months 3 infiltration parks this form of bioretention allows rainwater to be temporarily captured and stored for a short time cleaning stormwater runoff before infiltration portions of public parks and open spaces may be part of the stormwater system surrounding areas can be graded so that the rainwater flows towards the parks creating a gradual and imperceptible depression allows water to collect in the park and stay there long enough to infiltrate without giving the appearance of a stormwater facility the depression should store water for no more than 24 hours 22053d building applications all buildings in the srfbod should strive to achieve a goal of zero net energy practices in design and construction practices such as governed by the energy star program or the us green building council leed rating system some specific methods are as follows 1 solar orientation and utilization the use of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic techniques in the srfbod is highly encouraged massing of buildings should be considerate of solar access to neighboring properties particularly allowing sun during winter to properties immediately to the north a whenever possible buildings should be of a size and orientation to minimize the blocking of sunlight on public spaces such as sidewalks b windows should be oriented to make the best use of passive solar heating c the primary roof plane should face as close to solar south as possible to allow for installation or retrofit with solar panels d gable roofs and shorter buildings may be more appropriate on the south sides of a street while gable end roofs and taller buildings may be more suited for the north side e solar powered lighting should be used where feasible 2 other sustainable building design techniques there are many more opportunities to improve thermal envelope energy efficiency and use materials and equipment that reduce energy consumption in the srfbod such as the following a natural cooling glazing shading of glazed surfaces and operable windows b daylighting using natural light as the primary source of general illumination c heat reflective roofs and pavement d wind power systems and roofmounted solar energy generation e groundsource heat exchange closed system geothermal energy f onsite biomass use for energy production g renewable energy for heat and cooling h combined heat and power systems i green walls and green blocks j increased insulation eg r26 and tripleglazed windows k energy star rated appliances l ecostar or shared recycling programs m dualflush toilets and waterless urinals n ultraefficient heat and hot water systems o open and simple floor plans ie square and cubes p improved building air seal ie taped sheathing q graywater systems 22053e local food production to address sustainability issues such as open space conservation selfsufficiency improved nutrition recreation exercise and reduced food expenses the town of shelburne encourages smallscale agriculture to strengthen the local food system some techniques applicable in the srfbod include the following 1 community gardens a private not for profit or public common area used by a group of households to grow and harvest food crops or nonfood crops for personal or group consumption or donation 2 edible landscapes the utilization of plants and landscaping that produce edible food in settings that conventionally have been limited to ornamental or nonfood producing plants 22054 signage standards 22054a applicability in the case of a conflict between this section and other requirements pertaining to commercial signage in the zoning

shetbume vt educational facllltles impact fee program addendum addluon of cw expansion to fee schedule auaust 16 2005 introduction in june 2002 the town of shelburne adopted an impact fee program to help fund educational facilities needed to serve the towns growing population the fee which is based on the planned construction of a new middle school to serve grades 68 was explained in detail in the report prepared by burnt rock inc associates in community planning entitled educational facilities impact fee program dated  in 200 the five municipalities that comprise the champlain valley union high school cvu district voted to expand the cvu facility  to accommodate a growing student enrollment and address existing facility deficiencies as a member of the cvu district the town of shelburne is responsible for a proportionate share of the costs of this expansion these costs are eligible uses for impact fee revenues this report presents the analysis to establish the fonnulae for levying impact fees for high school grades 9  12 facilities calculating an impact fee to fund the cvu expansion as was the case with the fee established to partially fund the middle school project the general procedure for calculating the cvu facility expansion impact fee is i determine the perstudent cost to the town of new space designed to accommodate new students excluding the cost of space required to correct existing deficiencies  2 multiply the per student cost by the number of new students expected to be generated by each new dwelling unit   3 subtract estimated past and future tax payments used for debt service on the bond these calculations are described in the following sections the cost of the cvu expansion cvu high school located in hinesburg was constructed in 1968 in 1993 the facility was expanded to accommodate a growing enrollmenl as a result of the 1993 expansion the school had a capacityof997 students in may 200 district voters approved an $18400000 project that included renovations and facility expansion funding for the project is to be shared between the state which is expected to pay 30% $5520000 of the total cost with the remaining $12880000 to be paid by cvu member towns the $12880000 local share of the project was funded year bond issued in 2003 at an annual inte~ rate of 441 % the total cost principal and interest of this project will be $18873691 analysis of the project conducted by the town of williston in association with the cvu district indicated that 556% of the total cost was allocated to the renovation of existing space white 444% of the cost involved expanding the schools capacity thus $10493772 of  exhibit vol l page~ 20 auprt jj 2005 the local share of the project is for renovation and is therefore ineligible to fund fees while $8379919 was used to expand the facility to serve a growing student body ~noted prior to the expansion cvu high schools capacity was 997 students the ap8dlion funded by the 2003 bond brought the total capacity to 1410 students  an increase in capacity of 413 student spaces dividing the total cost of the project that le9ulted in expanded capacity $8379919 by the nmnber of new students served by that increased capacity1 413 yields a cost of$20290 per student space for the purposes of this study the total cost to the town of additional high school capadty ii estimated to be $20290 per studeat cw students generated by new dwelllngs the educational facilitlu jmpaet fee program report dated   which served as the basis for shelbumes current impact fee to partially fimd the development of a new middle school  identified that single family homes in town arc estimated to generate 036 students in grades k8 while multifamily units2 arc estimated to generate  k8 students partly due to shelbumes well regarded school system and quality of life it is widely presumed that most families with schoolage families remain in the community for the duration of their childrens public education therefore the number ofhighschool students is estimated to be 444% of the number ofk8 students thiy is based upon the k8 grade being comprised of nine grade levels while 912 is only 4 grade levels so that 444% ofk8 students would be expected to be in grades 912 over the counie of a single school year this results in an estimated high school generation rate of 01 s98 for single family dwellings and oos54 for multifamily dwellings  it should be noted that the student generation rates of dwellings may vary over the life of the unit its been suggested based upon anecdotal information that newer units in shelburne may be more attractive to young families and th~fore have a higher generation rate impact fees however must be based on the full life cycle of the dwelling not the generation mte for the yems immediately following construction thus generation rates must be based upon the average for the type of dwelling unit exclusive of the dwellings age 1 the axplllsion created acw capacity for 413

students opt to attend a school other than cvu after 8111 grade therefore the generation rate for high school students should be reduced to a factor of 093 to reflect the 93% ofk8 students likely to attend cvu therefore the generation rate for singlefamily dwellinp is estimated as  x 093   and the generation rate for multifamily dwelling units as  x 093    for the purposes of this study the high 11chool student generation rate ls estimated to be  students for single family dwellings and  students for multifamuy dwellings impact fee calculation using the facility cost figures and student generation rates the perstudent cost of that portion of the cvu expansion designed to accommodate new housing development may be calculated as such for singlefamily dwellings the fee ls based on the cost of fadllty space per student $20290 multiplied by the nwdber of9ll studenu per dwelling   $3015dwelllng for multifamily dwelllnga the fee is based on the cost offacillty space per student $20290 multiplied by the number of9ll students per dwelling unit    $1044dwelllng calculating property tax payment credits to cdswc that the fee is equitable vermont statutes require impact fee formulae to ensure that dwelling units assessed an impact fee arc not charged twice the raw land used for new dwellings was assessed property taxes some of which were used to offset the initial bond payments in addition the new dwellinp will continue to pay property taxes some of which will be used to offset the bond payments in order to avoid double paying the impact fee formulae must include provision for credits which reflect these past and future payments to this end the stream of tax payments is broken into two parts payments that occur before the dwelling comes onto the grand list and that occur after the dwelling comes onto the grand list in the former case prior to the payment of the impact fee there will have been a series of past tax payments made on raw land in the latter case there will be a stream of future tax payments made on the new dwelling after the impact fee was paid estimates were made of all annual capital expenditures including bond payments of principal and interest and annual capital expenditures for the portion of the $18400000 project that may be attributed to facility expansion 444% of the total or $8379 919 only a portion of this amount however will be repaid by shelburne taxpayers cvu assesses member towns on an annual basis based upon the percentage of total enrollment attributable to each town in 200 s~lburne s assessment was 285% of the total cvu budget this was slightly down from the page3 vol  i  page~  28 4uprt jj 1005 prior year but slightly above the average assessment over the past s years 279% given this recent trend and the lack of reliable longterm enrollment projections for the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that shelburne will continue to contnbute 28% of the cost of debt service on the expansion bond an estimated payment scbcdu1e for the portion of the project dedicated to facility cxpaosion to be repaid by cvu member towns and a schedule for the portion of those payments estimated to be funded by the town of
