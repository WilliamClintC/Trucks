legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood prevention and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction     92598 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of

20foot moisture penetration depth and shall provide recommendations to limit the potential for movement below all roadways to less than four inches and residential structures to less than two inches the depth of analysis may be reduced to less than 20 feet if it can be demonstrated that geologic conditions support a shallower active zone ie where shallow unweathered shale or static groundwater is present or swell pressures do not exceed overburden stress recommendations may include moisture treatment or excavation and replacement an example of a design procedure to calculate the potential for vertical heave is provided in attachment 2 to this article c attachment 2 to this article is intended to provide a guideline relative to the analysis for potential movement it is not intended to

inspection personnel as a minimum where space allows the excavation sidewalls shall be constructed at a one horizontal to one vertical slope or flatter where dictated by osha considerations c in general vertical sidewalls will not be allowed unless dictated because of space limitations for these conditions trench boxes and shoring will be allowed  however special provision for testing of the backfill during placement will have to be incorporated into the design in no case will testing of the backfill via test pits after completion of fill placement be allowed d the design engineer shall specify the required density to meet settlement and heave considerations in general it is recommended that utility fill less than 10 feet in depth be compacted to a density of between 93 and 98 percent of maximum density as determined by astm d 698 at a moisture of +1 to +4 percentage points above optimum moisture utility fill depths greater than 10 feet typically should be compacted to a density of between 95 and 100 percent of maximum density as determined by astm d 698 at a moisture of +1 to +5 percentage points above optimum moisture e the observation and testing program shall be developed by the design engineer to confirm that the fill has been placed and compacted to meet the project specifications minimum observation and testing is discussed in section  subgrade a all pavement within the special standards area shall have a subgrade stabilized to a minimum depth of 8 inches b the type of stabilization will be dependent upon the specific material exposed at completion of grading where lime is required by the design engineer lime series tests shall be conducted on the exposed subgrade initial testing may be performed during the geotechnical investigation  however it shall be required that samples of the subgrade be obtained at a maximum spacing of 250 feet on center at completion of initial grading each sample will be tested to determine its plasticity index pi lime series and the eadesgrimm method of ph astm d 2976 tests shall then be conducted on representative samples to evaluate the required percent lime for pi reduction and to obtain a ph of 124 after mellowing if the lime series indicates the pi of the limestabilized material cannot be reduced to 15 or less an initial application of lime followed by stabilization with cement will be required the percent lime will be the percentage plus one percent required to reduce the pi to its lowest value c if the required pi reduction is obtained the specified percent lime for stabilization shall be that required to obtain a ph of 124 after mellowing plus one percent d for soils where the pi is reduced to 15 or less lime stabilization will be performed in accordance with the latest

to promote the following objectives 1 to maintain the equilibrium of steep slope areas and control problems of erosion slumping and other earth movement 2 to minimize the increased runoff that accompanies the development of slopes especially during the construction phase when large tracts of land are disturbed 3 to minimize soil erosion by limiting activities that unnaturally expose the subsoils such as cuts stripping off topsoil and major regrading 4 to reduce the hazards associated with slope development including flash flooding landslides mudslides rock falls sheet gully and stream erosion 5 to minimize the scarring effects of grading and to protect and retain the natural character of the escarpment 6 to provide a factor of safety against unstable slopes or slopes subject to erosion and deterioration in order to protect human lives and property 7 to ensure that development is planned to fit the topography soils geology surface and groundwater hydrology and other conditions existing on the proposed site 8 to ensure a safe means of ingress and egress for vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and within the slope areas and to provide access for emergency vehicles necessary to serve the slope areas 9 to minimize the high cost of public improvements and maintenance associated with the development of slopes including the need for increased flood control and storm water management measures maintenance of sewer and water infrastructure and roadway maintenance sec 1 adopted  for the purposes of this article the following terms phrases words and their derivations

minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment which would otherwise degrade local water quality  3 minimize the total volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety b exempted activities 1 any agricultural activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan prepared or approved by the city as applicable  2 additions or modifications to existing singlefamily structures  3 development and redevelopment that disturbs less than one 1 acre of land provided it is not part of a larger common development plan final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the control authority  4 activities exempt from permit requirements of section 404 of the federal clean water act as specified in 40 cfr 232

to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the control authority for approval 2 the minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant provided that at least one of the following conditions applies a it can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article b provisions are made to manage stormwater by an offsite facility the offsite facility is required to be in place to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices c the control authority finds that meeting the minimum onsite management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site d nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site the size and cost of stormwater storage and the pollutants generated at the site 3 in instances where one of the conditions above applies the city may grant a variance from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided however to be eligible for a variance the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways a deterioration of existing culverts bridges dams and other structures  b degradation of biological functions or habitat  c accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation  d increased threat of flood damage to public health life property 4 furthermore where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management are waived the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the control authority mitigation measures may include but are not

rhizomatous whorls of purple flowers texas native adopted   sec 1 adopted   xeriscape standards and principles a purpose the city recognizes that it is desirable to accommodate xeriscape practices by using the principles explained in this ordinance within the city this chapter is intended to provide principles for xeriscaping each principle must be considered during the planning and design phase as the sequence of installation is also very important in assuring a successful xeriscape b xeriscape principles xeriscape is a method of landscaping that promotes water conservation rather than a specific look or a limited group of plants xeriscape is a combination of seven basic landscaping principles these principles are explained below in the order a landscape planner or property owner would consider to install the best possible landscape each principle must be considered during the planning and design phase as the sequence of installation is also very important in assuring a successful xeriscape 1 plan and design comprehensively have a plan consider the view slope exposure and soils of the area take into account the existing vegetation and topography of the site and intended use decide where & where things will be most landscapes are best done in phases a mixture of various heights of plants should be within the planned or designed area and arranged in an aesthetically pleasing manner 2 evaluate soil and improve if necessary soils can vary within a given site  an analysis based on random sampling can provide information for plant selection and soil amendments the soils in north texas range from clay to sand and both are low in organic material whether clay or sand the soil in your landscape will benefit from the addition of sphagnum peat moss compost aged manure or other decomposed organic materials this will improve root development and water penetration and retention consult with a local nursery or texas argi life extension services on how to improve the soil before planting and installing the irrigation system 3 create practical turf areas the type and location of turf areas should be considered a major design element of the landscape the selection and location of turf should be decided on the same basis as other plantings such as your purpose and function of the landscape the reduction or elimination of highwateruse turf areas and locating them separately so that they may be watered more efficiently can result in significant reductions in water use turf grass areas shall be consolidated and limited to those areas on the site that receive pedestrian traffic and provide for recreation use 4 use appropriate plants most plants have a place in xeriscape  even those that have high water needs plant selection should be based on the plants adaptability to the existing conditions present at the landscaped area and native plant communities particularly considering appropriate hardiness zone soil type and moisture conditions light mature plant size desired effect color and texture plant species that are drought and freeze tolerant are preferred use of more plants with low water needs and native plants will allow the maximum water conservation 5 water efficiently if an irrigation system is to be installed it should be well planned and well managed turf areas should be watered separately group plants with like water needs and water each group on separate zones not all plants need the same amount of water irrigation needs change with the season and the weather irrigate according to the needs of the plants rather than watering on a fixed schedule even plants used in xeriscape will require supplemental irrigation until they become established which can take between two to three years 6 use organic mulch mulch minimizes evaporation reduces weed growth slows erosion and helps prevent soil temperature fluctuations organic mulch such as wood chips or bark is best and although this mulch will decompose slowly over time it will improve the soil by adding nutrients the use of plastic is not recommended    491598 because it will cause organic mulch to slide or shift in location preventing air and water from filtering into the soil causing increased water runoff inorganic mulch such as rock should be used sparingly surrounding a home with rock will increase the temperatures making the environment too warm for plants and people 7 maintain appropriately proper pruning weeding and fertilization plus attention to the irrigation system will preserve and enhance the quality of xeriscape a landscape adapted to the environment will require less maintenance less fertilizer and reduce the use of pesticides and other chemicals c xeriscape plant selection 1 select trees shrubs perennials vines grasses and ground covers based on their adaptability to your regions soil and climate texas contains an abundance of beautiful native plants which are naturally adapted to the region most have lower water demands fewer pest problems and less fertilizer needs than many nonadapted exotic plants brought into texas landscapes 2 through the support of the nursery industry native texas plants are becoming more available in retail nurseries and garden centers combining texas natives with welladapted exotic plants is a key to a beautiful interesting landscape which conserves water refer to the tables in check with your local nursery or texas agri life extension agent for recommendations on adapted landscape plants d xeriscaping allowed 1 it shall be lawful for xeriscape plants to be planted or installed so long as such xeriscape plants are located in a planned and maintained area as defined herein 2 the city seeks to encourage each property owner to create and sustain a condition of ecological stability on their property that is a state of good health and vigor as opposed to one of impairment and decline 3 it is not the intent of this ordinance to allow vegetated areas to be unmanaged or overgrown in ways that may adversely affect human health or safety or pose a threat to agricultural activity 4 it is the express intent of this ordinance that it shall be lawful to grow xeriscaped areas as accent areas of the front yard but xeriscaped areas must be limited to 25% of the front yard i the accent areas in which xeriscape plants are permitted shall be in the front yard within determined boundaries 5 the accent areas and boundaries of the accent areas for xeriscape plants shall be determined by a border line parallel to and no more than five feet 5 inward from the sides and rear edges of the front yard as described and illustrated below i from either edge of the side property lines of the front yard ii from the rear edge of the front yard where it meets the residence building line iii due to the tall height of some xeriscape plants the area between the front edge of the front yard by the public sidewalk and the rear edge of the front yard save an area up to no more than five feet 5 from the rear edge where it meets the residence building line as illustrated in this ordinance shall remain free of all xeriscape plants 6 only the turf grass that encompasses most 75% or more of the front yard shall be allowed in the front area of a front yard 7 the areas described and illustrated in this ordinance are the permitted use accent areas for ornamental grasses 8 though xeriscape plants may be allowed in any of the above defined permitted use areas the totality of all accent areas used that contain xeriscape plants shall not exceed 25% of the total area of the front yard    492598 9 the illustration in this ordinance only shows the areas permitted for use of xeriscape plants and does not illustrate that every area can be used simultaneously simultaneous use of all permitted areas can result in more than 25% of the total area of the front yard being used which is not permitted 10 it will be the responsibility of the land owner to prove that accent areas containing xeriscape plants do not exceed 25% of the total area of the front yard and that such xeriscape plants do not extend or grow beyond the area in which such grasses are permitted 11 xeriscape plants in permitted use areas will not be required to meet the sixinch 6 height requirement for turf grass 12 any planned and maintained area that contains xeriscape plants must have visible physical borders around the boundaries of the permitted use accent areas see front yard illustration in this ordinance i the physical borders of the permitted use accent areas must be sufficient in depth and height to maintain separation of xeriscape plants and turf grasses ii it will be the responsibility of the land owner to keep xeriscape plants from growing or hanging over the borders in a manner that prevents visibility of the borders 13 as front yards are visible to the public this ordinance about xeriscape plants only applies to the front yard or any side or back yard that is visible to the public or other residents in the neighborhood i as long as all side or back yard areas are not visible to the public that is enclosed by a fence that meets the
