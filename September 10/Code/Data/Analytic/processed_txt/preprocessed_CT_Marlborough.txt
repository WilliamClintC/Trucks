water  34053 general provisions  34053  resources of marlborough and to reduce adverse impacts associated with increases in peak rates of stormwater runoff 2 objective a incorporate decentralized stormwater management systems in any new development designs  b minimize the increases in peak rates of stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation and stream bank erosion and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and downstream drainage structures  c minimize the increase in nonpointsource pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local groundwater and surface water quality  d minimize the total volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  e reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpointsource pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and designed to minimize potential threats to public safety 3 design and performance criteria in order to prevent the

limits of the town any arrangements or devices for the treatment of sewage and sludge  and has entered into a written contract with the colchestereast hampton joint facilities and the town of east hampton water pollution control authority whereby and wherein each party has agreed to accept treat and discharge the flow of sewage from certain parts of the towns public sewer into and out of the water pollution control facility owned operated and maintained by colchestereast hampton joint facilities b these regulations establish the procedures for making connections and use of the public sewer in the town they also establish specific limits for septic flows and pollutant discharges which by their nature or by their interaction with sewage will be detrimental to the public health cause damage to the public sewer or the water pollution control facility pollute the waters of the state or otherwise create a public nuisance further these regulations pertain to the sewer avoidance area of the town c these regulations are intended to 1 inform the public as to the technical and administrative procedures to be followed in obtaining connection to the public sewer system  2 prevent the introduction of pollutants into the public sewer system which will interfere with the collection andor treatment system  3 prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment system which will pass system inadequately treated into the waters of the state or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system  4 improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system  5 ensure the proper operation of onsite septic systems outside the sewer service areas in conjunction with the chatham health district d these regulations authorize the issuance of

these regulations  4102 water pollution control plan  4101 general provisions  4102  a purpose and authority in accordance with particularly cgs  7246 the mwpca hereby establishes the marlborough water pollution control plan plan for the town b area of concern in response to statutory and regulatory requirements administered and enforced by the connecticut department of energy and environmental protection the town initiated a sanitary survey conducted from 1999 to 200 to evaluate the condition of the existing onsite sanitary waste disposal systems in the lake terramuggus watershed and the marlborough town center area the study conducted by sea consultants inc resulted in the publication of the lake terramuggus wastewater facilities plan for the town of marlborough connecticut on the basis of that facilities plan the mwpca determined the geographical portion of the town shown and designated as the primary sewer service area and future sewer service area on the sanitary waste management plan in which public sewer construction is appropriate c sewer avoidance sewer avoidance is a desirable policy for municipalities where public sewers are located in a limited service area do not exist or are not planned the mwpca concludes that sewer avoidance is appropriate as a policy for the town outside of the public sewer services areas depicted on the sanitary waste management plan d designation and delineation of service and nonservice areas the mwpca hereby adopts and incorporates in this plan the map entitled sanitary waste management plan the map officially designates the primary sewer service district secondary sewer service district and the sewer avoidance district  4103 right of revision the mwpca reserves the right to establish by regulation or discharge permits more stringent standards than the existing requirements and standards of these regulations on discharges to the public sewer and to its facilities  4104 sewer service district boundaries a the mwpca hereby establishes a public sewer service district to be known as the marlborough sewer service district as shown on a map entitled sanitary waste management plan prepared by tighe and bond inc dated december 200 on file in the office of the town clerk of marlborough b there is a finite limit to the quantity of sewage that the joint facilities treatment plant can accept from marlborough it is thus not the intent of the mwpca to plan for growth of the marlborough sewer service district boundaries beyond those areas depicted on the sanitary waste management plan it is the role of the mwpca to allocate flows within the marlborough sewer service district and to minimize any expansion of the public sewer into the sewer avoidance district c the marlborough sewer
