new jersey division of water resources bureau of flood plain management or other areas which are frequently flooded some storm conditions will make the facility ineffective at providing retention of site runoff this will happen if the stream is already overflowing its banks and the detention basin causing the basin to be filled prior to the time it is needed in such cases the standards established in these regulations will be modified in order to give only partial credit to detention capacities located within a flood hazard area the credit will vary in a ration intended to reflect the probability that storage in a detention basin will be available at the time a storm occurs at the site b detention storage provided below the elevation of the edge of the 100 year flood plain will

approval by the board the design of a subdivision may be modified to take advantage of the natural drainage features of the land in such review the board will use the following criteria  the utilization of the natural drainage system to the extent possible  the maintenance of the natural drainage system as much as possible in its unimproved state  when drainage channels are required wide shallow swales with natural vegetation will be preferred to other sections  the construction of flowretarding devices detention areas and recharge berms to minimize runoff value increases  maintenance of base flow in streams reservoirs and ponds the reinforcement improvement andor extension of the natural drainage system to such extent as is necessary to eliminate flooding and excess maintenance requirements b all developments or portions of total schemes of development which based upon the preliminary plat submission total 15 or more acres will be expected to the extent that the board considers possible to limit the total stormwater runoff from the site after development to not more than the runoff from the site in its undeveloped state the utilization of the provisions of this subsection to limit such runoff is encouraged however the board may require the use of reasonable artificial methods of detention andor recharge if it determines that natural provisions are not feasible  the board may waive the provisions of this subsection if the nature of the development the character of adjacent previously developed areas or other factors make the utilization of natural drainage features or runoff limiting devices inadvisable or impractical  when a subdivider or the engineer determines that it will be necessary to utilize design standards in addition to or other than those minimum requirements established herein the engineer is advised to consult with the board engineer prior to beginning the detailed design for review and approval of the proposed design standards standards utilized should generally be nationally recognized and in common use in this area  when the board andor board engineer finds it necessary they may waive any or all of the requirements established herein and may require additional information in accordance with njsa d51  the township shall ascertain in each drainage instance the drainage area of which the specific subdivision is a

shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface water body under that grate a the new jersey department of transportation njdot bicycle safe grate which is described in of the njdot bicycle compatible roadways and bikeways planning and design guidelines april 1996  or b a different grate if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no more than seven 7 square inches or is no greater than one half 05 inch across the smallest dimension examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets the grate portion noncurbopening portion of combination inlets grates on storm sewer manholes ditch grates trench grates and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads including bridges driveways parking areas bikeways plazas sidewalks lawns fields open channels and stormwater basin floors
