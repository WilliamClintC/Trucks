planting season  street frontage interior and perimeter each development is required to address all three areas in the landscaping plan as it pertains to the particular site the landscaping plan must include plantings and green space along all street rightofways between lots with adjacent parking lots and also within the interior of the parking areas as the requirements apply to the individual site the text and diagrams below explain the options that the applicant has for the site exemptions from these requirements are addressed in section 5629 1 landscaped street frontage buffer a the landscaped street buffer serves two primary purposes when a parking lot is located adjacent to a public rightofway a strip of landscaping helps shield projecting headlights that may impair the vision of passing motorist or pedestrians therefore creating a safer environment  it also provides an aesthetically pleasing transition from the public right of way to private property b the site plan for any development other than those exempt in section 5629 must show a landscaped street buffer along all public rightsofway the applicant may choose among five options illustrated below choosing one or a combination of several to meet the particular site constraints of the development option 1 a minimum buffer of ten feet in width planted with a minimum of one shade tree and seven shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage option 2 earth berms at least two and onehalf feet higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot planted with a minimum of one shade tree and three shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage with no set dimension option 3 a sixfoot landscaped street buffer with three feet of fall that includes a minimum of one shade tree and three shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage option 4 a threefoot high wall made of brick stone or finished concrete along with fivefoot buffer area including one shade tree per 25 linear feet along street frontage option 5 a landscaped buffer area with existing woodlands maintained in 25foot strip along the street frontage 2 interior parking lot landscaping requirements a the parking lot landscaping requirement serves several purposes it provides necessary green space to give relief to expansive parking areas with nothing but asphalt and the trees provide shade and serve as windbreaks planting islands assist with vehicular circulation b the site plan for any development other than those exempt in section 5629 must show interior parking lot landscaping a sliding scale to determine the amount of green area per lot has been included in order for the applicant to include these landscaping requirements as an integral part of the site development total area of parking lot area % total area of lot for interior planting excluding building and interior planting islandsincluding the street frontage buffer perimeter strip and the travel lanes 300049999 sq feet  8 50000149000 sq feet  10 150000 sq feet  or larger 15 c the diagram in subsection d illustrates what areas of the vehicle accommodation area are considered when determining the total area of the parking lot the square footage of all areas within the parking lots perimeter are counted including the planting islands required curbed areas corner lots parking spaces and all interior driveways and aisles except those with no parking spaces located on either side landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirement the total amount of green space for the interior lot is determined by figuring eight percent ten percent or 15 percent of the total parking lot area as explained above d planting islands are required as a part of the green space percentage in the interior parking lot area the diagram below illustrates the parking island dimensions the dimensions of a parking island must be a minimum of nine feet by 19 feet the same as a parking space and must be curbed to protect the landscaping and trees one parking island required for every 15 parking spaces determined for that use group from the minimum parking standard identified in the use unit section of the zoning ordinance if 13 or more spaces remain an additional parking island is required the planting islands must be evenly spaced among the parking spaces in the lot and serve as vehicular delineators whenever possible in parking lots over 150000 square feet the number of parking islands can be reduced but the total square footage of green space must remain according to the requirements e trees are required to be planted in the interior parking area to offer shading from the heat and sun one tree per planting island is required for the interior parking area with the balance planted in grass or other vegetation these trees must be planted within the island and a fourfoot clearance should be left for car doors to open from adjacent parking spaces f plant materials at vehicular entrances should be located so as to maintain safe sight distances and protect from vehicular lubricants or fuels 3 perimeter landscaping other than street frontage perimeter landscaping requirements define parking areas and prevent two adjacent lots from becoming one large expanse of paving when perimeter landscaping is require the diagram below illustrates this concept at minimum a fivefoot landscaped strip is required along the side and rear lot lines of a development with one tree per 25 linear feet required along lot lines a the perimeter landscaping requirement does not preclude the need for vehicular access to be provided between lots b the tenfoot perimeter strip is required for each development regardless if one is already in place from an adjacent developed lot c no pavement may extend within five feet of the property line on any lot unless it is included with an ingressegress location  landscape installation a standards have been established for installation of all plant materials within the city these requirements must be followed in order to receive approval of the site work and final occupancy or approval of the development the planning and community development director or other person

inspector b temporary occupancy permits may be issued by the building inspector for weather related delays in the completion of a project the developer shall deposit with the city clerk a surety bond letter of credit or cash for 150 percent of the cost of remaining improvements as approved by the director of the planning and community development division the builder must request a final inspection and make every attempt to finish the project and provide a time frame for completion that both parties must agree upon  minimum tree and shrub planting requirements a trees shall not be

will maintain all trees and vegetation b temporary occupancy permits may be given to tenants from november 1 to march 1 if inclement weather delays completion of project these requests must be approved by the planning and community development director  alterative methods of compliance an application for alternative landscaping schemes is justified only when one or more of the following conditions apply 1 the sites involve space limitation or unusually shaped parcels 2 topography soil vegetation or other site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible or impractical 3 due to a change of use of an existing site the required buffer yard is larger than can be provided 4 safety considerations require a change the applicant shall describe in a letter to the planning department which of the requirements set forth in the manual will be met with modifications which project conditions justify using alternatives and how the proposed measures equal or exceed normal compliance  list of recommended trees and shrubs the following lists indicate plantings which will meet the landscaping requirements of this chapter the lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for screening and shading purposes plants were selected for inclusion on these list according to four principal criteria 1 general suitability for the climate and soil conditions for this area 2 ease of maintenance 3 tolerance of city conditions 4 availability from area nurseries when selecting new plantings for a particular site a developer should first consider the type of plants which are thriving on or near that site however if an introduced species has proven highly effective for screening or shading in this area it too may be proper selection tree choices evergreen american holly austrian pine japanese black pine norway spruce colorado blue spruce cherry laurel deciduous eastern redbud flowering

opaque opaque broken none b description of screens the following three basic types of screen are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth above 1 opaque screen type a a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least eight feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet an opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation the opaque screen may be composed of a wood masonry or framed metal wall landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation see examples below materials not allowed for screening walls include plywood scrap lumber wood pallets chicken wire concertina wire fabric which includes plastic tarps vinyl or other sheeting or similar material chain link slats or fiberglass panels fence posts and supports must be installed on the side of the screening wall that faces the lot being screened concertina wire is not allowed when screening between residential uses compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants 2 semiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet the semiopaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces the semiopaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants 3 broken screen type c a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation the screen may contain deciduous plants    1 3816 variances the planning commission may approve variances and thereby authorize a property owner andor developer to depart from the literal requirements of this chapter where strict enforcement of said requirements would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the

permit the subdivision of land and zoning review into one process the combination review permits a development proposal to be acted upon simultaneously by the developer and the city this system is advantageous when the developer that plats the land and provides access and utilities also provides the amenities that make the overall project marketable an additional advantage is that the approved pud plan remains intact even if transfer in ownership occurs the approved pud plan represents a commitment by both the developer and the city the pud process permits more flexibility in the choice of building types the arrangement of varied land uses and the use of generalized rather than specific development regulation by permitting and encouraging the use of such procedures the planning commission and the city council will be able to make more informed land use decisions and thereby guide development more effectively in the best interest of the city the pud should 1 facilitate and encourage a maximum of social and community interactions and activity among those who live shop play and work there 2 provide open space not only for traditional private use in setbacks and yards
