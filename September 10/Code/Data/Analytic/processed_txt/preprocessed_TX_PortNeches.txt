water conservation plan introduction and objectives water supply has traditionally been a key issue in the development of texas in recent years the increasing population and economic development in region i have led to growing demands for water at the same time local and lessexpensive sources of water supply are largely developed additional supplies to meet higher demands will be expensive and difficult to develop therefore it is important that the city make efficient use of existing supplies in order to utilize these sources as long as possible such efforts will delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies and delay the high cost of additional water supply development recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has created guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency pans for public water suppliers the tceq guidelines and requirements for water suppliers are included in appendix a the city has adopted this water conservation plan pursuant to tceq guidelines and requirements the objectives of the water conservation plan are as follows  to reduce water consumption   to reduce the loss and waste of water   to identify the level of water reuse   to improve efficiency in the use of water   to extend the life of current water supplies exh a  1 572009 texas commission on environmental quality rules 1 conservation plans the tceq rules governing development of water conservation plans for public water suppliers are contained in title 30 part 1 chapter 288 subchapter a rule 2882 of the texas administrative which is included in appendix a for the purpose of these rules a water conservation plan is defined as a strategy or combination of strategies for reducing the volume of water withdrawn from a water supply source for reducing the loss or waste of water for maintaining or improving the efficiency in the use of water for increasing the recycling and reuse of water and for preventing the pollution of water a water conservation plan may be a separate document identified as such or may be contained within another water management documentss according to tceq rules water conservation plans for public water suppliers must have a certain minimum content  and must have additional content for public water suppliers that are projected to supply 5000 or more people in the next ten years section 46127 and may have additional optional content section 46129 exh a  2

table 32 shows historical and projected per capita municipal water use for the city water use is shown in units of gallons per capita per day gped per capita municipal water use is municipal water use divided by population the per capita municipal water use includes industrial use projected per capita municipal uses were obtained from the texas water development board twdb and interpolated to match the appropriate years for the fiveyear and tenyear goals the twdb projections are applicable for a dry year in which outdoor water use would be high per capita municipal water use in a year with normal or high precipitation during the summer should be less than projected 3 accurate metering of raw water supplies and treated water deliveries raw water and treated water pumpage for all customers of city including public water supply is metered each meter has an accuracy of plus or minus five percent the raw water and finished water meters are calibrated annually by qualified personnel to meet the state requirements set by tceq the meters are repaired or replaced as needed 4 metering of customer and public uses and meter testing repair and replacement water usage for all customers of city not including public and governmental users is metered all meters in the city were replaced in 20052006 and were upgraded to a radioread system as part of water conservation the city operates a meter replacement program that will replace every meter based on its usage identified life cycle in addition meters registering any unusual or questionable readings are tested and repaired to restore full functionality 5 determination and control of unaccounted water unaccounted water is the difference between raw water drawn from the lower neches valley authority canal and metered deliveries to customers this includes authorized but unmetered uses such as fire fighting and releases for flushing of lines unaccounted water can include several categories  inaccuracies in customer meters customer meters tend to run more slowly as they age and underreport actual use  losses due to water main breaks and leaks in the water distribution system   losses due to illegal connections   firefighting   system maintenanceline flushing the city will conduct a water audit every five years using the format recommended by the texas water development board the audit will divide water losses into apparent losses and real losses apparent water losses include water that was actually used but not accounted for such as customer meter errors or theft accounting for apparent losses increases the citys utility revenue but does not reduce water usage real losses include leakage and overflows at the water treatment plant identifying and preventing real losses decreases a utilitys costs and decrease water usage the city will target real losses under this conservation strategy as shown in appendix c unaccounted water for the city has varied from seven percent to 20 percent in the last five years with the measures described in this plan the city intends to maintain the unaccounted water below 18 percent in 2020 and subsequent years if unaccounted water exceeds this goal the city will implement a more intensive audit to determine the sources of water loss and reduce the unaccounted water 6 continuing public education and information campaign the continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation for the city of port neches includes the following elements  promote the citys water conservation measures presented in this section and sections 46128 and

regulations designed to minimize flood losses art i  a 11191987  ii 422009 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art i  b 11191987  iii 422009 purpose of article it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas
