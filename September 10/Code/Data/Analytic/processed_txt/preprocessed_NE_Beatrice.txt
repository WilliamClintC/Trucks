27252739  reserved article iii  erosion and sediment control purpose and intent the purpose and intent of this article is to control or eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation within the jurisdictional limits of the city it establishes standards and specifications for conservation practices and planning activities which minimize soil erosion and sedimentation during the construction process to safeguard persons protect property and prevent damage to the environment this article will also promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any best management practices bmps used when development activities disturb or break the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city during the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes in addition clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat following the completion of construction activities dust dirt and erosion will continue to affect the stormwater facilities and receiving streams unless post construction practices are put in place during the construction and maintained there after until fully stabilized the article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels 2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality 3 minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable 4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety  12108 applicability this article shall apply to all land disturbance or land filling activities or soil storage where the total of volume of disturbed area that meets or exceeds one 1 acre land disturbance less than one 1 acre apply if the land disturbance is part of a larger development that disturbed one 1 acre or more activities that do not require approved plans or permits must still provide bmps as necessary to control water quality any surface intended for vehicular traffic shall provide vehicle sediment tracking control vstc areas with the possibility of sediment runoff will require protective measures at the request of the city in order to minimize possible pollution to the storm sewer system minimum requirements for other activities may be obtained by written request to the city planning and building inspections department accompanied by an adequate description of proposed work  12108 compatibility with other regulations the article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance rule regulation or other provision of law the requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other article rule regulation or other provision of law and where any provision of this article rule regulation or other provision of law whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control  12108 responsibility for

findings of fact & purpose 501 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 1943 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area 502 findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city of beatrice nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards this article uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this article it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  as amended 2 calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 53 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood 503 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in a by applying the provisions of this article to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to
