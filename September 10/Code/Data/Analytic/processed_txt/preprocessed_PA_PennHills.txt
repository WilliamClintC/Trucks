located some harmful effects of one land use upon another can be prevented zoning subdivision controls and housing and building codes other aspects of development are more subtle and less amenable to exacting rulesofthumb promulgated without regard to specific development proposals among these are the general form of the land before and after development the special relationships of the structures and open spaces to proximate land uses and the appearance of buildings and open spaces as they contribute to an area as it is being developed the site plan review process addresses these factors by
