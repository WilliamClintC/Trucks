following definitions shall apply intermittent stream  a stream with a drainage area of 50 acres or greater perennial stream  a stream that flows continuously throughout the year in most years stream  a natural watercourse containing flowing water for at least part of the year c in addition the specific purposes and intent of this article are to 1 reduce the amount of nutrients sediment organic matter pesticides and other harmful substances that reach watercourses wetlands subsurface and surface water bodies by using scientifically proven processes including filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation denitrification and by improving infiltration encouraging sheet flow and stabilizing concentrated flows 2 improve and maintain the safety reliability and

benefit a definition the stream buffer conservation zone is defined as areas surrounding municipally designated surface water bodies including creeks lakes and intermittent watercourses that intercept surface water runoff wastewater subsurface flow andor deep groundwater flows from upland sources and function to remove or buffer the effects of associated nutrients sediment organic matter pesticides or other pollutants prior to entry into surface waters this area may also provide wildlife habitat control water temperature attenuate flood flow and provide opportunities for passive recreation this

watercourse zone one shall extend the entire distance of this sloped area if the distance of this sloped area is greater than 75 feet there will be no requirement for the establishment of zone two if the distance is less than 75 feet the width of zone two will be adjusted so that the total buffer width zone one and zone two will be 75 feet maximum b zone two  this zone will begin at the outer edge
