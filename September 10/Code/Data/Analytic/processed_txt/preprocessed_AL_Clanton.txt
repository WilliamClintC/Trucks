this has been codified as art v  21012114 of this chapter at the discretion of the editor cross reference personnel ch 15 back purpose the purpose of this article is to 1 state the citys policy prohibiting discrimination and prohibiting sexual harassment 2 specifically address sexual harassment by defining what it is by assisting employees in identifying sexual harassment by listing types of sexual harassment and some concrete examples by describing who can be involved in sexual harassment and by providing employees a procedure by which they can complain of sexual harassment and have their complaints investigated and resolved 3 encourage any employee who believes that he or she is a victim of sexual harassment to come forward and voice their complaint to their superiors so that the city can act to end any sexual harassment i 121498 city policy governing discrimination it is the policy of the city and all departments thereof to provide equal employment opportunity and equal treatment to all employees in all aspects of employment without regard to race color religion sex including pregnancy age forty 40 or over national origin or physical or mental disability of an otherwise qualified individual i 121498 city policy governing sexual harassment it is the policy of the city and all departments thereof to prevent sexual harassment and to guard against any occurrence which remotely resembles this illegal act sexual harassment lowers morale and is damaging to the work environment therefore the city will treat sexual harassment like any other form of employee misconduct it will not be tolerated i 121498 sexual harassment defined sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other verbal visual written or physical conduct of a sexual nature when 1 submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individuals employment  or 2 submission to or rejection of such conduct by any individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting an individual  or 3 the purpose or effect of such conduct is to substantially interfere with the individuals work performance or to create a hostile or abusive work environment i 121498 identification of sexual harassment a sexual harassment may occur in a variety of forms four 4 categories of sexual harassment and some concrete examples of conduct which may constitute sexual harassment if unwelcome are 1 verbal unwelcome words of a sexual nature directed at another including making sexual demands or sexual propositions  sexual innuendos  demeaning sexual jokes  references to a persons anatomy  catcalls  whistles  demeaning namecalling  remarks on the intimate details of ones life or sexual likes or preferences  and if unwelcome invitations for lunch dinner drinks or dates 2 visual unwelcome exposure to visual objects such as pictures photos drawings cartoons magazines objects or posters including poster calendars  sexually obscene gestures or obvious staring  and nudity 3 written notes or letters of sexual content or propositions  sexually explicit literature poems or magazine articles  and obscene words phrases or graphics on walls bulletin boards or posters 4 physical unwelcome physical contact with another including touching hugging kissing patting fondling grabbing rubbing pinching and in some instances close physical positioning b this list does not include all the possible behavior which could be viewed as sexually harassing by the city and which could result in job discipline it is merely a list of offensive behaviors other behaviors might be viewed as being sexually harassing depending on the circumstances and frequency in which they occur plus some of the behaviors on the list might not in all circumstances be sexually harassing such as when they are not unwelcome c employees are reminded however that certain behaviors may be inappropriate for other reasons even if the behavior is not sexually harassing for example intimate behavior at work such as kissing and handholding with a willing partner is always unprofessional the city wishes its employees to err on the safe side i 121498 involvement in sexual harassment sexual harassment can occur in a wide variety of circumstances and may encompass many variables it is important to realize that 1 victims can be of either gender male or female 2 harassers can be of either gender male or female 3 harassers may be supervisors of victims but harassers may also be coworkers or even nonemployees 4 harassers and victims need not be of the opposite gender if the conduct is still based upon sex 5 victims may be thirdparty observers affected by the behavior of others and exposed to a hostile or abusive atmosphere based upon sex 6 victims need not suffer any financial loss 7 the sexual harassment need not seriously affect a victims psychological wellbeing or lead the victim to suffer injury  instead conduct or an environment based upon sex that a reasonable person would and does believe to be hostile or abusive constitutes sexual harassment i 121498 registration of complaints with superiors a any employee of the city who feels they have been subject to sexual harassment should register a complaint with their immediate superior however if it is their immediate superior who is the alleged harasser the employee should register their complaint with the superior next in charge if all supervisors over the employee are believed to be involved in the sexual harassment the employee should register their complaint with the mayor likewise if an employee believes that the mayor is involved in the sexual harassment the complaint should be made to any departmentlevel supervisor b the sexual harassment complaint may initially be made verbally by talking to the appropriate supervisor the complaint will then have to be put in writing and signed and dated by the person complaining an employee may write their own complaint or if the employee wishes the supervisor will assist the employee in drafting a complaint of sexual harassment c to the extent practicable a complaint of sexual harassment will be kept confidential with due regard to the sensitive nature of such complaints i 121498 prompt investigation of complaint the city shall fully impartially and promptly investigate any sexual harassment complaint filed by one of its employees i 121498 confidential report of investigation a confidential written report of the result of the investigation will be submitted to either an impartial supervisor of the complainant or to the mayor depending on the situation at hand also the complainant will be promptly informed of the results of the investigation if the investigation reveals that the accused harasser acted in a manner to sexually harass the complainant the accused employee will also receive a copy of the special investigators

steps to discipline the offending employee or employees including if appropriate immediate discharge any city employee who acts in a manner to sexually harass any other city employee is acting outside

documents or other evidence contesting the report to a higher supervisor or the mayor if the circumstances so dictate i 121498 retaliation prohibited no employee of the city shall discharge or otherwise discriminate or harass any other city employee who has filed a complaint of sexual harassment under this policy or who has sought redress for sexual harassment with the equal employment

and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the

suitable structures should first be sought these guidelines are designed to ensure the compatibility of towers with and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties and in order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health safety and general welfare of the community the city council finds that these regulations are necessary in order to 1 facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses of the city 2 minimize adverse visual effects of towers design and siting standards  3 avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure standards and setback requirements  and 4 encourage and maximize the use of existing and approved towers buildings and other structures to accommodate
