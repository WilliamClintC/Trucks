interest during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of jeanne kristan former village clerk the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 8 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with

title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing

convenience health welfare and safety require the establishment of additional school and park sites and facilities serving the new residents of the village demographic studies of the residential portions of a proposed subdivision or planned unit development can be readily and scientifically conducted to determine the number of elementary and secondary schoolage children and adults to be generated therefrom and provide data by which the required dedications of land and capital costs specifically and uniquely attributable to the activity of the subdivider and the proposed subdivision or planned unit development may be calculated it has been found and determined by the village that the provision and location of school sites and buildings to serve the immediate and future needs of residents and children of each new residence subdivision or planned unit development are just as essential to proper land development as are streets water sewers and sidewalks and to that end the village has determined that the dedication of land for school sites or cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication and the donation of capital costs shall be required of each subdivider of a single lot subdivision or planned unit development the continued residential development presents local school districts with special challenges land for new school facilities may need to be acquired new school facilities may need to be built and old school facilities may need to be renovated because new development will require the school districts to incur costs to make services available prior

offered by the school districts can continue to be offered in the future this land or cash or combination thereof shall be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula a criteria for
