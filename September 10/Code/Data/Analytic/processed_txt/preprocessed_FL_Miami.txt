walkable centers for adjacent residential neighborhoods 3 ensuring that private development contributes to increased infrastructure capacity and embellishes a pedestrianfriendly public realm of highest ambient quality 4 establishing a rational process for successional growth in areas identified for density and growth  transect principles the miami 21 intended to encourage the evolution of a settlement pattern based on the organizational principles of the transect the transect is defined as a geographical crosssection that reveals a sequence of environments applied to the human or the built environment the transect is used to identify and organize a continuum of the physical environment ranging from the least to the most urban transect planning creates coordinated integrated and harmonious environments based on the arrangement of all the components to support locational character within the range of urban contexts each different type of location called a transect zone has development function intensity and disposition appropriate to the location and integrates the details of the corresponding public realm to ensure this integration the miami 21 development on well as establishes guidelines for the detailing of public rightofway for example narrow streets with open swales find their place in neighborhoods of suburban character while wide streets with tree lined sidewalks accompany commercial development in more intense urban areas the transect encourages the making of places that build on historic character and that evolve over time this evolution with the principles enumerated below guiding growth or reduction in density and intensity is called succession successional change emerges from a vision of the larger urban context and appropriate transitions across transect zones the city of miamis urban context is comprised of a series of neighborhoods corridors urban centers and districts each with its own arrangement of transect zones in all cases the goal of transitoriented pedestrianfriendly mixeduse urbanism shall guide the arrangement of transect zones thoroughfares buildings and landscape the specific design of each component should be appropriate to its transect zone as provided in this zones are sequential in intensity successional zoning changes shall only be permitted sequentially and respecting transitions across abutting

standards for design and construction maintained in its most current form at the city of miami department of public works where these guidelines conflict with the manual the standards of the manual shall apply the urban landscape is characterized by a set of interdependent elements that create a sense of place these include thoroughfare type building type frontage type and the form and disposition of landscape and lighting thoroughfares provide the city with both the major part of public open space as well as moving lanes for vehicles bicycles and transit a thoroughfare is associated with a particular type of movement and is endowed with two attributes movement type and character the movement type of the thoroughfare refers to the number of vehicles that can move safely segment within a given time period  it is physically manifested by the number of lanes and their width by the centerline radius the curb radius and the superelevation of the pavement the character of the thoroughfare refers to its suitability as a setting for pedestrian activities and is physically manifested by the associated frontage types as determined by location within the transect thoroughfares can be assigned appropriately to transect zones with calibrated rightofway widths movement types design speed number of travel lanes pavement width curb radius and verge type in zones t3 and t4 d1 d2 and d3 generally sidewalks occur at the edge of the rightofway in zones t5 and t6 sidewalks occur at the edge of the rightofway and are given the additional dimensions of the 10 foot

widths are measured inside of curb to inside of curb  curb and gutter may range from 16 for city thoroughfares to 20 for some county thoroughfares  parking spaces range from 70 to 90 including pan  they should be wider on higher speed thoroughfares but may be restricted by existing rightofway dimensions  right turns may be taken from the parking lane  tree spacing is 22 on center to match parallel parking or 25 on center to match lot line spacing  tree planters have a minimum dimension of 4 x 4 increased where possible to a 4 x 8 dimension  bulbouts may be added where thoroughfare widths are wide and design speed high or where sidewalks are narrow in order to facilitate pedestrian safety thoroughfares must evolve with the needs of the city as miami continues to grow a thoroughfare may change in character reflecting new density or conversely a return to an historic dimension for instance a continuous lawn planter may be replaced with individual tree wells for additional sidewalk space or a wide neighborhood street may be narrowed to control traffic intrusion the accommodation of bicycles and transit requires detailed response to the existing thoroughfare

from this table and adding the result to the greater use parking requirement for instance a building with a residential use requiring 100 spaces and a commercial use requiring 20 spaces the 20 spaces divided by the sharing factor of 12 would reduce the total requirement to 100 plus 17 spaces for uses not indicated in this chart on a mixed use lot a sharing factor of 11 shall be allowed additional
