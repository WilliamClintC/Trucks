the basis of the ordinance from which this article is derived uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no

it is deemed that other amenities or conditions produce an equal or higher standard and quality of development 4 commercial areas will be planned and developed so as to result in attractive viable and safe centers and clusters as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares control of vehicular access architectural quality landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on nearby
