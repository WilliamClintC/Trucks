appendix a was first zoned in 1967 as a planned development under which acknowledged the permitted site uses related to hospital operations with additional site restrictions concerning height of buildings setback and green belt requirements access restrictions and fence restrictions in 1998 council adopted the planned development overlay process for all planned developments in the community this ordinance established a procedure to convert planned development districts such as the hospital district created in 1967 and amended in 199 to the planned development overlay process the conversion required council when the property owner applied for any substantive modification to the planned development to rezone the property to one of the conventional zoning districts at that time districts a  while imposing upon the particular property the planned development overlay restrictions in 1995 the hospital development restrictions were modified in part by the hospital entered into an agreement with neighboring residential properties on the south property line providing certain protective covenants and restrictions between the hospital and these property owners bpurpose with this history in mind the purpose of this section as codified is to establish the underlying conventional zoning district for the bethesda site the o office district while recognizing the historically permitted uses from the 1967 ordinance as modified by the 1995 ordinance as overlay development restrictions for the bethesda site and to incorporate future development of the site into the development plan review process as set forth in these specific development standards have been established in the past to ensure maintenance and growth of the existing hospital and healthcare facilities on the subject property in a manner compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods it is intended that these standards be incorporated in this section and supplemented by development standards applicable to other properties within the o district in the event that the standards set forth below specific to the bethesda site conflict with the development standards outlined in this the regulations of this section shall supercede cprincipally permitted uses and accessory permitted uses for the bethesda site 1principally permitted uses hospital and related healthcare facilities including extended care facilities medical office and outpatient service facilities and medical and nursing education and research facilities 2accessory permitted uses aresidential uses for hospital

principally permitted use cplaces of worship dparking for the hospital site 3other uses any additional permitted and accessory uses within the o office district are recognized for the bethesda site any conditionally permitted uses from the o office district which have not been recognized herein as permitted or accessory uses for the bethesda site shall remain conditionally permitted for the site and must be considered pursuant to by way of an example and not by way of limitation the o office district recognizes hospitals as a conditionally permitted use the 1967 ordinance as modified by the 1995 ordinance and adopted herein as  c recognizes hospitals as a permitted use for the site therefore any site development within the defined hospital use does not require a review under for development expansion but as a permitted use any development expansion within the hospital use requires development plan approval dheight setback and open space requirements the following height

title of the blighted premises and to take direct action to remove or remedy the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make further provisions for future development redevelopment or use
