given credit against the developments total obligation for transportation mitigation fees to the extent that such construction contribution or dedication to a particular transportation improvement project exceeds the transportation mitigation fee which would otherwise have been due for that transportation project if the value of such construction contribution or dedication exceeds the total of the transportation impact fee obligation for the proponents development the proponent shall be entitled to reimbursement from transportation mitigation fees attributable to that particular transportation improvement project and paid by subsequent developers within the plan area such reimbursement shall be made to the proponent in the same proportion as the proponents construction payment or dedication bears to the total of the new development portion of the costs of such project  4planned transportation improvements or strategies for which there is in place a financial

cooperate with thurston county and other cities within the county to expeditiously review the transportation impacts of developments located within such jurisdiction such cooperation shall include the exercise of all powers under existing contractual agreements the promotion of future contractual agreements and the adoption by the county of common development standards all cooperative efforts shall be directed towards evaluating and mitigating the actual impacts of development projects upon the transportation improvement projects located within the respective jurisdictions if the projected transportation impacts on lacey transportation improvement projects of those developments located outside the city but within the plan area are not required to be mitigated by the jurisdiction in which such development is located or voluntarily mitigated by the developer in a manner equal to the requirements of this ordinance the city shall not extend utility services to such development unless required to do so by prior agreement or force of law         methods of providing transportation improvements a development proponent may be required to directly mitigate the transportation impacts of such proposed development or be required to pay transportation mitigation fees such mitigation methods shall be carried out as follows adirect mitigation construction of traffic improvements which are required of a proponent as direct mitigation under lmc  must be completed by the time of completion of development or an assurance device to guarantee completion of such improvements must be deposited with the city the assurance device shall be in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the estimated improvement cost such assurance device shall be deposited with the city at the time of building permit issuance final plat approval or other approval to proceed the direct payment of a lump sum for signal timing shall be considered a direct mitigation under this subsection bthe transportation impacts from each development within the plan area except those impacts directly mitigated as provided in subsection a of this section shall be mitigated by the payment of a transportation mitigation fee such fee shall be determined paid and expended as follows 1the city shall determine the number of pm peak hour trips generated from or to such development which impact each transportation improvement project listed in the transportation improvement program in making such determination the city shall consider all relevant factors including the developers participation in public transportation ride sharing and other transportation demand management programs and services further in order to recognize the increased tax revenue to be received by the city to offset transportation improvement project costs from nonresidential developments to be located within the city and the jobs created by such developments the city shall divide the number of pm peak hour trips generated from or to such nonresidential development which impact each transportation improvement project by a factor of two provided however that such division shall not be made of those pm peak hour trips generated which impact that transportation improvement project designated as marvin and i5 interchange improvements 2the number of pm peak hour trips determined in subsection b1 for each transportation improvement project shall be multiplied by the cost per trip as set forth on table 14t15 as the same may annually be hereafter modified for each transportation improvement project included within the program such cost per trip is determined by dividing the total estimated or actual cost of the transportation improvement project by the consistent denominator of traffic volume set forth for each such project the cost per trip is determined by such calculation in order to provide a reasonable portion of the funding of such projects to solve the cumulative impacts of planned growth and development within the plan area a cost per trip which is less than the cost determined by such calculation may be approved by the city council as part of its periodic review of the transportation improvement program in order to assure that such transportation mitigation fees do not exceed those fees reasonably necessary as a direct result of a proposed development if the cost per trip as set forth changes between the date of development approval and the date of mitigation fee payment or first payment pursuant to the installment method due to projected construction cost increases or decreases the fee due shall be in accordance with the cost per trip in effect at the date of such payment or first installment provided however that the average cost per trip for a residential development not generating trips to or from that transportation improvement project designated as marvin and i5 interchange improvements shall not exceed the sum of $104000 the average cost per trip for those residential developments generating trips which impact the transportation improvement project designated as marvin and i5 interchange improvements shall not exceed the sum of $104000 plus a sum equal to the per trip cost exceeding $104000 for those trips generated by the development and impacting the marvin and i5 interchange improvements project the $104000 limitation set forth herein shall be increased on july 1 of 1998 and july 1 or each year thereafter in an amount equal to the increase in the engineering news record construction cost index over a date one year earlier 3the transportation mitigation fee determined shall be payable for those designated transportation improvement projects constructed or to be constructed after the passage of this ordinance the requirement to pay such fees shall apply even though the transportation project has been completed prior to development application or the due date of mitigation fee payments such requirement shall continue until the trips generated for a particular transportation improvement project from developments which have paid mitigation fees for that project equal the number of trips shown as mitigated volume on the transportation improvement mitigation list 4the city shall maintain accurate accounting records showing the amount of mitigation fees paid for each transportation improvement project the source of the funds the date the funds where contributed and the date amount and purpose of all expenditures of such fees the accounting records shall be public records and open to inspection 5transportation mitigation fees collected as a result of a particular new development shall be used to pay for transportation improvements mitigating the impacts of such development within six years after actual receipt of such funds mitigation fees paid towards more than one transportation improvement may be pooled and expended on any one of the improvements impacted by the development application of fees received to reimburse the public or other developers for designated transportation improvement projects previously completed shall be deemed to be an expenditure of such fees for purposes of this subsection any funds not expended in the manner set forth in this subsection within six years of collection of such funds shall be refunded in full to the property owner of record at the time of the refund 6the transportation mitigation fee as so determined shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of a building permit in all cases except residential subdivisions the property owner may pay the transportation mitigation fee in a lump sum upon building permit issuance or at the owners option by annual installments with interest over a period of five years in the case of residential subdivisions or short subdivisions if the developer chooses to pay the transportation mitigation fee at the time of final plat approval such developer shall have the same installment option as set forth for non residential developments if the option to pay by installment is chosen the property owner or developer shall be required to pay twenty percent of the total fee at the time the building permit is issued or in the case of residential subdivisions at the time the final plat is approved and the remaining balance in equal installments over a period of five years with interest at the rate set by the state treasurer and published in the washington state register pursuant to rcw  for the month december of the year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the promissory note is provided to the city the developer or property owner may pay the outstanding balance with accumulated interest at any time without penalty if any installment is not paid within ten days of the date it is due the total outstanding balance shall immediately be due and payable the installment method of payment may only be used if additional security satisfactory to the city is provided to guarantee such payment for those developments not requiring a building permit the initial development or construction permit issued shall be treated as a building permit for purposes of determining the due date and manner of payment of the transportation mitigation fee payment of a mitigation fee is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts for a particular location therefore mitigation fee credit cannot be transferred to any other location 7nothing herein shall prevent the city from approving local improvement districts proposed transportation latecomer agreements or other means of financing transportation improvements provided however that the developer or owner of properties shall be given credit against such other means of financing for mitigation fees paid

accessory dwelling units adu aintent and specific design criteria accessory dwelling units are a necessary and desirable use for all residential neighborhoods because of the increased density they represent and providing of an additional dwelling unit in a nonconventional way it is important to have the units blend in with and complement the primary use on lots it is also important to ensure that both residents of the accessory dwelling unit and main unit have adequate privacy to do this special design features are required additionally it is important to promote compatibility and complementary design of accessory structures with primary structures in an area to protect the character of the neighborhood bdesign requirements in order to assure that the development of all accessory dwelling units and those accessory structures to which this section is applicable is consistent with policies of the comprehensive land use plan the following special design features and provisions shall apply to all accessory dwelling units 1size an accessory dwelling unit shall be limited in size to fifty percent of the size of the main unit and not to exceed eight hundred fifty square feet in floor area except as provided in subsection c of this section 2density calculations for the purposes of calculating residential density accessory dwelling units shall not count as a dwelling unit 3only one adu per lot permitted there shall not be more than one accessory dwelling located on a lot in addition to the singlefamily dwelling 4subordinate to main use the accessory dwelling unit shall be clearly subordinate to the primary use as demonstrated in the building design and location design for this purpose shall include the following considerations aintegration with main unit and appearance if the unit is integrated into the main unit design shall present the overall appearance of the structure as an individual singlefamily residence designs which give the impression of a duplex shall not be permitted a separate entrance to the accessory dwelling may be in view from public rightofway but should blend in to the primary unit in a way that does not indicate its function as an entrance to a separate unit bdetached from main unit and appearance if the accessory dwelling is detached from the main unit it shall be located in a position on the lot that presents a less dominant focus than the primary use design shall present the general impression that it is clearly an accessory building to the primary use cabove the garage and appearance if the unit is located on top of a detached garage design shall complement the architectural style of the main residence while maintaining the primary unit as the main emphasis and focus for the lot 5privacy for residents is a main focus maintain privacy of adjacent residences by using a combination of native and droughttolerant landscaping vegetated lid facilities screening fencing and window and door placement to reduce the opportunity of accessory dwelling units having direct visibility into windows porches and decks care shall be given to location of windows so that they do not intrude onto the private space of adjacent neighbors if the garage and adu are rear loaded for enhanced security windows are encouraged to provide eyes on the alley 6driveway consolidated the driveway to a separate detached accessory unit shall be consolidated with the existing driveway area 7distance from other structures for those accessory units that are detached distance separation between the primary residence shall meet building code requirements 8livability of neighborhood in order to ensure that an accessory dwelling unit fits into and contributes to the livability of the neighborhood design and construction shall aroof design ensure that roof breaks and pitch closely relate to the primary residence window proportions shall complement the accessory unit  bmaterials use similar exterior materials roof siding and trim and a color that complements the primary residence  cheight of roof ridge in general the roof ridge of the primary residence should be higher than the accessory dwelling unit an exception is when the accessory dwelling unit is built onto the second story of an existing unit 9parking at least one parking space should be provided for the accessory dwelling unit this parking may be provided in a garage a parking space adjacent to the alley or if available by onstreet parking 10pedestrian access a pedestrian walkway from the street or alley to the primary entrance of an accessory dwelling unit shall be provided such walkway may be shared with a driveway 11accessory structures to promote compatibility and consistency of design and neighborhood aesthetics all accessory structures requiring a building permit shall be required to have design review review shall ensure accessory structures are constructed of similar material and in a complementary design to primary structures on site on immediately adjacent lots provided a different design or material may be approved if it is demonstrated that the design and material will enhance the general character and appearance of the neighborhood and promote policies of the comprehensive land use plan all applications for construction of such accessory structures shall demonstrate that the proposed structure will be in compliance with any protective covenants or other restrictions applicable to the property cguidelines for varying from the size requirement of b1 of this intent the intensity of use and impacts from an accessory dwelling unit is expected to be less than that of the primary dwelling because it is intended to be accessory to the main unit and designed to be limited in scope it is not designed to expect a double loading of full size residential units on lots intended for singlefamily development this expectation is important in the overall planning of infrastructure and services to a subdivision this design limitation protects the overall quality and character of the subdivision and the planned capacity of subdivision infrastructure while still allowing for the extraordinary benefits and advantages the adu is intended to provide the accessory dwelling unit must necessarily be subordinate to the primary use to this purpose limitations have been established for the size of the accessory dwelling units however there may be circumstances applicable to the subject property and existing buildings that require a smaller size than permitted to limit identified impacts alternately the city realizes there may also be circumstances applicable to existing structures and the subject property that would make a larger size more practical or functional without compromising the intent or the subordinate nature of the proposed adu 2guidelines to accommodate special circumstances the following guidelines have been developed to allow reasonable variation from the size standards of subsection b1 of this section when reviewing an accessory dwelling unit for size requirements the following guidelines and criteria shall be applied aincreasing size 1basis for consideration when a request is for an adu of a size larger than the established maximum the following situations may be valid reasons for the administrator to allow an increased size generally this will involve the following situations where the proposed size of the adu is logical given circumstances and if permitted would have no discernable impact on the appearance of the main unit or in meeting the intent of design requirements of this chapter athe adu is located within the existing main unit such as a basement unit and the logical use of the floor area exceeds the square foot limitation  bthe adu is located within the existing main unit and use of the area rooms and configuration of existing space proposed for the adu is more logical and functional than options of trying to reduce its size simply to fit the size standard  cspecial circumstances considering the configuration of the property andor existing buildings make the increased size logical from a building or design standpoint and more functional 2mandatory criteria for increase in size any request to increase the size must meet all of the following criteria athe proposed adu can meet all other design expectations of this chapter and is subordinate to the main unit both functionally and in appearance bthe proposed adu will not have a discernable impact in the context of the neighborhood in which it is located considering infrastructure support services and neighborhood character cthe increased size is logical from a design standpoint given configuration of existing structures or organization of space and is the least amount of size necessary to accommodate the circumstances bdecreasing size 1compromise design expectations given the unique nature of the site andor structures the full size permitted for the adu will compromise other design expectations needed to make the adu subordinate to the main structure or meet the intents of this chapter  2impacts to neighborhood character infrastructure or services the proposed adu while meeting the allowed size limit will have a discernable adverse impact in the context of the neighborhood in which it is located considering infrastructure support services or neighborhood character  3not logical given site considerations the proposed adu while meeting the allowed size limit is not logical from a design standpoint given either configuration of existing structures the organization of space size of lot or space available and the full size is not necessary to accommodate the intended use and function of an adu       design criteria for detached singlefamily dwelling units and cottage housing aintent to ensure that new development contributes to the visual character of the city  to create developments that promote walking and bicycling  to create variety and interest in the appearance of streets  to encourage interaction among neighbors  to minimize impacts of vehicular access on the streetscape  to ensure privacy of residents and adjacent properties  to provide usable yard space for residents  to provide design details that add visual interest  to provide flexibility where unique site conditions exist see table 14t20 broof design provide pitched or articulated roof line or other roof element such as eyebrow roof forms or dormers that emphasize building form and help it fit in with neighboring structures with prominent roofs pitched roofs shall utilize a minimum slope of four feet vertical to twelve feet horizontal encourage rooflines along the side yard that maximize solar access to adjacent homes andor private open space see table 14t21 carchitectural details provide for architectural details that add visual interest to the neighborhood and are well proportioned to achieve good

7landscaped trellises or other decorative elements that incorporate landscaping near the building entry 8distinctive paint schemes 9other decorative facade elements or details that meet the intent of criteria see table 14t22 dside facade treatments in order to create a separation between yards and beautify private space where zero lot line or reciprocal use easement concepts are used utilize the following treatments 1use horizontal wood siding or other similar exterior material that provides visual interest t111 siding is not permitted along the privacy wall 2a planting strip with native and droughttolerant vegetation vegetated lid facilities andor a pergola or other similar feature that adds visual interest along the privacy wall is encouraged see table 14t23 eentries provide clearly defined building entries which face the street and are well lighted and easily accessible specific standards 1weather protection shall be provided at least four feet deep along the width of the building entry for each dwelling unit exceptions may be granted by the director for the use of regional housing styles that do not traditionally contain such entries 2at least fifty percent of houses in a development shall have entries that face the street and are clearly visible from the street undeveloped lots vested prior to  are exempt from these requirements 3raised entries and porches are recommended particularly where front yard setbacks have been reduced raised porches help define private space yet create a pedestrianfriendly streetscape 4exterior stairways are prohibited on the facade except for stairs leading to the front porch or entry such stairways shall be simple bold projections of stairways to fit with the architectural massing and form of the building and the neighborhood thinlooking open metal prefabricated stairs and railings are discouraged see table 14t24 fgarages and driveways design streetscapes in a way that garages and driveways do not dominate the street and facade of the residential building 1rearloaded lots with garages off of alleys are encouraged 2for lots less than four thousand square feet in size garages shall be located off of alleys behind or in back of residences stepped back from the front facade of the dwelling or other techniques used to ensure the garage does not dominate the streetscape 3for all lots garage doors facing the street may not occupy more than sixty percent of the ground level facade of the house for example in a fortyfootwide lot with a thirtyfootwide house a garage door facing the street shall not be greater than eighteen feet in width see table 14t25 4threecar garages are allowed provided the garage doors take up less than sixty percent of the ground level facade of the house the garage is separated into at least two doors one of the doors is set backmodulated at least two feet behind the other door and a planting strip at least two feet wide separates at least one of the drive lanes see table 14t26 5driveways shall be as narrow as possible to minimize impervious surfaces and shared where possible to minimize disruption of the sidewalk by curb cuts 6no more than one driveway is permitted per dwelling unit 7garage sidewalls that face the street eg as a result of garages being aligned at an angle or perpendicular with the house shall appear to contain habitable space this can be accomplished by incorporating windows and other design elements into the garage wall that are in character with the remainder of the dwelling 8for front loaded lots where the garage faces the street and the garage is located in front of the facade of the house at least two of the following design details shall be utilized for front loaded lots where the garage faces the street and the garage is even with the facade of the house or less than five feet behind the front facade of the house at least one of the following design details shall be utilized aa decorative trellis over the entire garage ba balcony that extends out over the garage and includes columns ctwo separate doors for twocar garages instead of one large door ddecorative windows on the garage door edecorative details on the garage door standard squares on a garage door will not qualify as a decorative detail fa garage door color other than white that matches or complements the color of the house gother design techniques that meet the intent as determined by the director see table 14t27 gprivacy standards 1window placement placement of windows shall consider privacy so residents from one unit to the next cannot look directly into another unit 2location and orientation of dwelling units shall consider privacy 3side yard screening options all developments shall utilize one of the following screening methods in side yards aprovide type i ii or iii landscaping as defined in lmc  between adjacent homes bprovide solid wood fence or masonry wall or combination of wood and masonry six feet in height and located along the property line cprovide a zerolot line configuration or other similar treatment whereby one side of a home does not feature transparent windows or other openings and thus maximizing privacy on the side yard of the adjacent dwelling unit dother treatments that meet the intent of the criteria as approved by the director examples can include lower fencing andor reduced or alternative landscaping treatments see table 14t28 hexterior materials 1traditional materials consistent with local and regional architectural styles are encouraged horizontal wood siding and brick 2stucco and other troweled finishes should be trimmed in masonry or wood 3mirrored glass and exposed concrete block except for foundationcrawl space walls where not visible from the street are not in keeping with the desired character of lacey and are prohibited 4t111 siding and other plywood types of siding board and batten is an exception shall not be used for facades adjacent to or directly viewable from a street iwindows and transparency 1transparent windows andor doors facing the street are required to meet this requirement at least ten percent of the facade must be transparent the facade is measured from the base of the house to the start of the roofline and any other vertical walls facing the street except for gabled portions of the facade not containing livable floor area see table 14t29 for clarification garages facing the street shall count as part of the facade undeveloped lots vested prior to  are exempt from this requirement 2building facades visible from a public street shall employ techniques to recess or project individual windows above the ground floor at least two inches from the facade or incorporate window trim at least four inches in width that features color that contrasts with the base building color exceptions will be considered where buildings employ other distinctive window or facade treatment that adds depth and visual interest to the building see table 14t30 jarchitectural variety developments shall achieve architectural variety by accommodating a variety of architectural styles variations of the same architectural style and use of multiple design elements specifically 1duplicative house designs adjacent to each other are prohibited simple reverse configurations of the same house design on adjacent lots are not sufficient to meet architectural variety goals exceptions may be granted by the director in special circumstances where similar architectural consistency provides a distinct character for a cluster of homes surrounding an open space or on a particular street cottage homes around a common open space are an example 2generally the more houses in a subdivision the greater the number of different facade elevations will be required specifically aten to nineteen homes a minimum of four different facade elevations shall be used btwenty to thirtynine homes a minimum of five different facade elevations shall be used cforty to sixtynine homes a minimum of six different facade elevations shall be used dseventy or more homes a minimum of seven different facade elevations shall be used alternatives will be considered provided the design and configurations of the subdivision meet the intent see table 14t31 3in order to qualify as a different facade elevation dwellings shall have different roofline configurations different color palettes and different porchentry design in addition a minimum of two of the following alternatives shall be utilized adifferent window openings location and design bone and twostory houses cdifferent exterior materials and finishes ddifferent garage location configuration and design eother different design element that helps to distinguish one facade elevation from another as determined by the director 4variation in lot size within a subdivision is encouraged for singlefamily lots for example larger corner lots can provide more visual interest and also allow for more usable open space for such residents as those lots have two street frontages 5variation in house sizes is encouraged within developments a combination of one and twostory structures is attractive to a wider demographic particularly seniors kcorner on corner lots are encouraged to take advantage of the dual frontage make an architectural statement and create interest in architecture and human activity on the street this could be accomplished by providing one or more of the following 1wrap around porches 2bay windows or turrets 3varied exterior materials roof feature colors andor articulation varied materials shall complement each other see table 14t32 lencourage alternative lot configurations a land division and its internal access roads pedestrian connections and overall lot configuration should be designed to allow placement of homes to address functional design issues as much as the configuration allows placement and orientation of homes should consider privacy solar orientation access location and access to open space and other factors that can contribute to the overall livability of the home and its relationship to the surrounding environment flexibility shall be encouraged in spatial orientation of homes on lots to address these issues and create interesting and attractive streetscapes with homes having a high functional value that might not otherwise occur with a less flexible approach to maximize site efficiency and usable open space small lot developments are encouraged to utilize zero lot line and courtyard access configurations as described below 1zero lot line this is a configuration where the house andor garage is built up to one of the side property lines providing the opportunity for more usable side yard space standards adwelling units and accessory structures may be placed on one interior side property line the opposite side yard shall be at least ten feet bprivacy wall in order to maintain privacy no windows doors air conditioning units or any other types of openings in the walls along a zero lot line structure are allowed except for windows that do not allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot examples include clerestory or obscured windows see table 14t33 for an example of a privacy wall for a zero lot line house ceaves along a zero lot line may project a maximum of eighteen inches over the adjacent property line 2reciprocal use easement works similar to the zero lot line configuration except that the homes and accessory structures that meet the standard setbacks and easements are granted on one side yard to allow consolidated use of the side yards by the adjacent property see table 14t34 for example also configurations providing for reciprocal use easements in the rear yard are allowed to maximize usable open space see table 14t35 standardsprovisions areciprocal easements shall be noted on the plat bprivacy wall in order to maintain privacy no windows doors air conditioning units or any other types of openings in the walls of a structure along a reciprocal use easement are allowed except for windows that do not allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot examples include clerestory or obscured windows see table 14t23 for an example of a privacy wall careas within reciprocal use easements may count towards usable open space requirements for applicable lots 3courtyard access includes a series of lots clustered around a private internal roadway standards amaximum number of lots served by a courtyard access five this includes lots fronting the street on either side of the courtyard access bmaximum length of a courtyard access one hundred feet or deeper if approved by the local fire department csurface width of courtyard access twelve feet due to the limited length wider drives are unnecessary safety and function and undesirable aesthetics dan easement of twenty feet in width shall be secured over the applicable parcels to allow lots legal access to the public street a maintenance agreement shall be required for all applicable lots and must be recorded on the final plat see table 14t36 4pedestrianonly entry includes configurations where one or more lots are clustered around a pedestrian easement andor common open space and do not front on a street see table 14t37 for an example standards aa pedestrian entry easement shall be provided to all homes that do not front on a street alley or common open space bpedestrian entry easements shall be a minimum of fifteen feet wide with a fivefoot minimum sidewalk cthese lots must contain private detached or shared garages off an alley or other access if approved by public works and reviewed for conflicts with existing codes 5protective covenants the styles of developments discussed above require special consideration to ensure conflicts between neighbors are minimized and that opportunities are provided for a home owners association to deal with unique issues created by these development forms covenants for these development styles shall be written to address issues unique to small lot developments that use reciprocal use and easement agreements great latitude shall be allowed the city in reviewing and requiring covenant elements that deal with identified issues malley design alleys shall be designed to incorporate landscaping and lighting elements specifically 1landscaping elements may be used as an alternative to fencing to separate private yard space from the alley 2fences shall be set back at least three feet from the alley pavement to provide for landscaping to soften the view of the fence see table 14t38 for a good example of how landscaping can enhance the design of an alley 3garages shall feature buildingmounted lighting to provide illumination of alleys for safety       design criteria for duplexes and triplexes in areas predominantly built out with singlefamily detached structures to locate duplex and triplex units in areas developed with singlefamily structures will be controversial because of perceptions that rental units could potentially devalue traditional singlefamily units one way to allay these perceptions is to provide duplex and triplex units that blend in with the environment this can enrich the architectural standards and appearance of the surrounding subdivision or neighborhood to do this special guidelines are needed to promote outstanding design and quality of such units asimilarity to singlefamily detached structures to accomplish this duplex and triplex units in singlefamily residential areas shall comply with the design criteria for detached singlefamily dwellings in lmc  unless otherwise noted below see table 14t39 bsupplemental design criteria where there is a conflict with the detached singlefamily design criteria set forth in lmc  the design criteria herein shall apply 1entry design ause either a single entry providing access to multiple units with appearance of a single entry to a singlefamily house or separate distinct covered entries  bfor duplexes located on street corners entries shall be provided on different sides of the structure so only one entry is visible from any one street 2location of garages garages for each of the units shall be separated from one another by living units of one or more of the units except where designed with adjacent single or tandem garages no more than two single or tandem garages may be placed in a row 3architectural variety when reviewing developments with multiple adjacent duplexes each duplex structure shall be reviewed as an individual home or building in terms of compliance with lmc j cdesign option duplexes and triplexes can either be designed to look like one singlefamily house containing one distinct entry or designed to look like two or three distinct dwelling units each with their own individual covered entry both design options shall utilize complementary design elements as described in subsection d of this section dcomplementary design units shall have a design that provides significant architectural interest and is complementary to singlefamily units in the subdivision a number of techniques can be used to achieve architectural interest 1roof breaks use of dormers masonry chimneys  2modulation of facades and fenestration  3use of balconies decks and porches elandscaping utilize native and droughttolerant landscaping andor vegetated lid facilities that complement the architecture of the unit           design criteria for lacey historic neighborhood to recognize and preserve the historical values and neighborhood character of the lacey villas area special development standards are necessary these standards should allow reasonable infill while maintaining the older neighborhood historical characteristics including large lot sizes and singlefamily traditional housing styles aeach lot may have one singlefamily detached structure and one accessory dwelling unit that meets the design criteria of lmc  home occupations meeting requirements of lmc may also be permitted see table 16t062 ba neotraditional singlefamily detached housing style is required with the following features 1a usable front porch  2a focused predominant entryway  3an alternative garage style including a detached or recessed garage  4a pitched roof with architectural interest  dormers chimneys and roof breaks recommended  5horizontal lap siding shall be used on the front back and all sides cnarrow local access streets with no sidewalks typical of existing streets are permitted dif street lights are used they shall be of decorative design and pedestrian scale twelve to eighteen feet in height         design criteria for townhouses the following criteria will be utilized by staff in review of a projects design additional design strategies may be considered if they meet the intent of this section to provide for an attractive development that is complementary to the existing neighborhood and addresses functional components of design in the context of the needs of future residents and surrounding neighbors townhouses are also subject to the multifamily design criteria in this section and other design criteria in lmc   the townhouse design criteria herein shall apply aintent 1to ensure that townhouse developments enhance the character of the street 2to reduce the impact of garages and driveways on the pedestrian environment 3to reduce the apparent bulk and scale of townhouse buildings 4to promote architectural variety that adds visual interest to the neighborhood 5to promote infill development compatible and complementary to the surrounding neighborhood 6to promote attractive safe and functional design that addresses the needs of future residents and is properly integrated into the surrounding neighborhood environment see table 14t40 bstreet access townhouses fronting a street must all have individual groundrelated entries accessible from the street configurations where enclosed rear yards back up to a street are prohibited the director may allow exceptions to these rules depending on the nature of the site and where design treatments have been included to enhance the character of the street such departure must meet the intent of the guidelines and goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan in terms of desired character of the area and pedestrian access cpedestrian entries new developments must emphasize individual pedestrian entrances over private garages to the extent possible by using both of the following measures 1enhance entries with a trellis small porch or other architectural feature that provides cover for a person entering the unit and a transitional space between outside and inside the dwelling 2provide a rain garden where feasible or planted area in front of each pedestrian entry of at least twenty square feet in area with no dimension less than four feet provide a combination of native and drought tolerant shrubs or groundcover and a street tree refer to city arborist or street tree list dgarage configuration for any townhouse configuration where the primary pedestrian access is off the same facade as vehicular access developments shall incorporate singlewidth parking configurations for at least fifty percent of the units this will minimize the impact of garage doors on the pedestrian environment the director may grant departures to this provision provided design treatments effectively minimize the impacts of garage doors on the pedestrian environment see table 14t41 edriveways on private internal streets where townhouse units are served by private internal streets developments are encouraged to limit the depth of driveways between the streets and the garage wall to deemphasize vehicular access driveway depths of five to ten feet are appropriate to allow the maneuverability and provide space to include the required landscaping and entry elements for each unit the shallow width also discourages residents from parking cars in their driveways by default this encourages residents to keep their vehicles in their garage additional surface parking spots should be scattered around the development to provide space for guests see table 14t42 fbuilding articulation townhouse buildings shall be articulated to emphasize individual units thus if individual units are fifteen feet wide the building shall include at least three articulation features per guideline lmc d2 for all facades facing a street common open space and common parking areas at intervals no greater than fifteen feet grepetition with variety townhouse developments shall employ two or more of the following repetition with variety guidelines 1reversing the elevation of two out of four dwellings for townhouses 2providing different building elevations for external townhouse units versus internal units by changing the roofline articulation windows andor building modulation patterns 3adding a different dwelling design or different scale of the same design such as a onestory version of the basic dwelling design where two stories are typical or a two story design where three stories are typical 4other design treatments that add variety or provide special visual interest while the variable use of color on buildings can be effective in reducing the perceived scale of the building and adding visual interest color changes alone are not sufficient to meet the intent of the criteria see table 14t43     design criteria for multifamily projects condominiums and townhouses the following criteria will be utilized by staff in review of a projects design additional design strategies may be considered if they meet the intent of this section to provide for an attractive development that is complementary to the existing neighborhood asite design and parking 1intent ato create safe and vital streets by encouraging development to enhance the street environment bto create new development that contributes to natural surveillance and provides for the personal safety of residents cto ensure that new development reinforces the existing or desired spatial characteristics of the neighborhood dto promote infill development compatible and complementary to the surrounding neighborhood eto promote attractive safe and functional design that addresses the needs of future residents and is properly integrated into the surrounding neighborhood environment 2building location and orientation all residential buildings must be oriented towards streets interior private roadways or common open space and not parking lots or adjacent properties specifically apedestrian building entrances shall face the street and be clearly visible from the street bbuilding entries that face onto

they front on a street or private interior access road bcommon parking garage design guidelines buildings containing abovegrade structured parking shall screen such parking areas with type ii or iii landscaping as defined in lmc  or incorporate contextual architectural elements that complement adjacent buildings or buildings in the area to the satisfaction of the director upper level parking garages must use articulation or fenestration treatments that break up the massing of the garage andor add visual interest see table 14t46 bvehicular access and connectivity 1intent ato provide for visual continuity of the street bto minimize conflicts with pedestrian access to the buildings on site 2minimize the number of vehicular access points by sharing driveways and linking parking lots between adjacent uses 3parking spaces onsite should be separated from major drives and the circulation patterns of such drives should be clean 4coordinate circulation drives and staging areas to accommodate routes needed by fire refuse collection delivery vehicles moving vans etc 5consideration shall be given to loadunload parking zones near the entry of the building these spaces shall be located in such a manner as to minimize interferences with the entryway 6a bus pullout and shelter may be required by intercity transit or north thurston school district the shelter shall meet the guidelines of intercity transit and the development guidelines the director of community and economic development may require additional bus shelter design features 7developments are encouraged to consider the needs of individuals with physical limitations in the layout and design of buildings for example developments could provide some units available with street level access or other provisions to provide for accessibility 8meet all requirements of lmc  cpedestrian access and amenities 1intent ato orient developments to the pedestrian by making pedestrian access convenient safe and inviting bto encourage walking cto enhance the character of multifamily development dto minimize impacts to residents privacy eto provide accessible safe convenient and usable onsite open space for the enjoyment of residents of the development fto create open spaces that enhance the residential setting 2internal paths and circulation an onsite pedestrian circulation system meeting the following standards shall be provided apathways between dwelling units and the street are required such pathways between the street and buildings fronting on the street should be in a straight line exceptions may be allowed by the director where steep slopes prevent a direct connection or where an indirect route would enhance the design andor use of a common open space see table 14t47 bthe pedestrian circulation system shall connect all main entrances on the site for townhouses or other residential units fronting on the street the sidewalk may be used to meet this standard for multiplefamily developments pedestrian connections to other areas of the site such as parking areas recreational areas common outdoor areas and any pedestrian amenities shall be required where applicable celevated external stairways or walkways which provide pedestrian access to dwelling units located above the ground floor are prohibited the director may allow exceptions for external stairways or walkways located in or facing interior courtyard areas provided they do not compromise visual access from dwelling units into the courtyard see table 14t48 dappropriate screening or buffering to create a physical separation between pedestrians and vehicle access areas and the windows of residential units shall be provided acceptable treatments include 1landscaped beds that separate the pathway from the building facade featuring windows see table 14t49  andor 2site windows to maximize privacy while allowing for surveillance from dwelling unit for example where ground floor units are raised three or more feet above the level of a walkway pedestrians have limited views into dwelling units epedestrian walkways should be defined by type ii or type iii landscaping as defined in lmc  for a combination of overstory and understory vegetation fprovide signage to identify pedestrianbicycle routes according to the department of public works development guidelines

requirements for zones with pedestrian emphasis and key multimodal corridors and intersections a major emphasis of the comprehensive plan is to create more opportunities for pedestrians and multimodal transportation key multimodal corridors and intersections designated in the comprehensive plan and zoning map will be the heart of the citys circulation system if the citys goals of a more pedestrianfriendly city are to be realized these multimodal corridors and intersections and surrounding road networks must develop with amenities and designs that will entice pedestrians bicyclists and transit riders aapplicability standards listed under subsections b and c of this section apply to all zones with pedestrian emphasis standards for circulation and design for multimodal corridors and key pedestrian intersections apply to all zones along such corridors and at key pedestrian intersections provided multifamily condominium and townhouse development with less than five units and all singlefamily short plats and permits for individual singlefamily detached homes and accessory uses shall be exempt bgeneral requirements 1increase pedestrian amenities and function along key multimodal corridors at intersections and in pedestrianoriented zones 2provide a network of comfortable and interesting pedestrian streets which link residential areas with commercial zones throughout the growth area 3reduce dependence on the automobile in zones with pedestrian emphasis by providing increased emphasis on other modes of transportation such as walking bicycling and transit provision of pedestrianoriented multimodal streets 4provide a high quality compact pedestrianoriented street environment that is easily and pleasantly traversed on foot 5increase architectural continuity and compatibility within and between zones 6encourage business and pedestrian areas and spaces that are active throughout the day and evening 7improve sidewalk and building integration which increases

the street wall may be set back to provide transition to residential neighborhoods to provide more separation of public and private space in residential development to meet centerline setback requirements for building entrances for pedestrian plazas and to allow existing setback buildings as conforming uses 1building entrances allowance large entryways which are integral to a building design may be set back more than fifteen feet 2pedestrian plazas 2pedestrian plazas pedestrian plazas are intended to be open to the public but are not required to be they are spaces which people will use along intensively developed streets multimodal corridors and in some commercial and all mixed use corridors facilities and buildings can be grouped around small pedestrian plazas to create places where people may congregate all commercial subdivisions or binding site plans in mixed use zones or zones with pedestrian emphasis are expected to provide plazas unless the city determines the provision of such is not consistent with the intent of this chapter due to special circumstances of the site or project commercial or multifamily building projects in the mixed moderate or high density corridors may provide plazas to obtain bonus building or development coverage pedestrian plaza designs must meet the following criteria asize and dimension the maximum width of the pedestrian

dull building facades can degrade a pedestrian streetscape and the business environment as they deaden the surrounding space and break the continuity of the building edge therefore the construction of blank walls shall be limited to prevent the disruption of existing building patterns and to avoid an uninviting street environment the regulations in this section are intended to reduce blank wall impacts on the pedestrian and business environment ablank wall limitation requirements 1all commercial ground level walls within fifty feet of a street or pedestrian area shall feature

and visually accessible from the adjacent street or major internal pedestrian route open spaces shall be in locations that the intended users can easily access and use rather than simply leftover or undevelopable space in locations where very little pedestrian traffic is anticipated locations integrated with transit stops for instance would be encouraged as there is likely to be pedestrian traffic in the area 2must be inviting inviting open spaces feature amenities and activities that encourage pedestrians to use and explore the space on a large scale it could be a combination of active and passive recreational uses it could include a fountain sculpture childrens play area special landscaping element or even a comfortable place to sit and watch the world go by in order for people to linger in an open space it must be comfortable for instance a plaza space should receive ample sunlight particularly at noon and have design elements that lend the space a human scale including landscaping elements benches and other seating areas and pedestrianscaled lighting no use shall be allowed within the open space that adversely affects the aesthetic appeal or usability of the open space 3must be safe safe open spaces incorporate crime prevention design cpted principles anatural surveillancewhich occurs when parks or plazas are open to view by the public and neighbors for example a plaza that features residential units with windows looking down on space means that the space has good eyes on the park or plaza blighting that reflects the intended hours of operation clandscaping and fencing avoid configurations that create dangerous hiding spaces and minimize views dentrances should be prominent well lit and highly visible from inside and outside of the space 4maintenance open spaces shall utilize commercial grade materials that will last and require minimal maintenance costs walls where necessary shall be designed and treated to deter graffiti use and maintain landscape materials that reduce maintenance cost and maintain visibility where desired 5provides for usesactivities that appropriately serve the anticipated residents and users of the development for example common open space that serves a variety of functions will attract greater usage when designing open spaces project applicants should consider a broad range of age groups from small children to teens parents and seniors 6additional criteria aconsolidation of open space is encouraged to provide maximum access visibility usability minimization of impacts to residential uses and ease of maintenance bexisting trees and significant vegetation shall be maintained in open space areas unless an alternate landscaping plan for such areas is required or approved or unless planned active recreational activities would conflict with existing vegetation in case of conflicts with planned activities the design should strike a balance as determined by the city where it maximizes active recreation opportunities while trying to maintain the most important stands of trees and vegetation see table 15t07 cfor the purpose of calculation of the applicable percentage requirement open space shall be separate and distinct from buffers required yard areas setbacks and other undeveloped portions of the site dopen space areas shall be designed and placed in consideration of existing and potential open space on adjacent parcels to provide consolidation or opportunities for future consolidation of neighborhood open space areas ethe open space shall include amenities such as benches trails or picnic tables to provide usable relief from buildings and pavement fcash or like value of land area and improvements may be donated to the city for open space purposes to fulfill a portion of open space requirements within that specific parks planning area acceptance of such donation will be at the discretion of the city and consistent with city policies for the provision of open space gup to fifty percent of a developments open space requirement may be satisfied by wetland andor critical area habitat and required critical area buffers in consideration of the significant passive recreation opportunities provided by said lands the remaining fifty percent open space requirement must be set aside outside of the wetland and wetland buffer area to provide for and accommodate proposed or potential future active high intensity recreational use bresidential open space location open spaces shall be considered an integral part of the entire development design see table 14t67 for examples of desirable and undesirable open space locations the following shall be considered when choosing the location of an open space 1open spaces should not be located at intersections adjacent to arterials or collectors unless located at a key pedestrian intersection 2open spaces should be easily accessible to a majority of the lots or units 3open spaces should be located so that children have sidewalk access to it and have to cross as few streets as possible 4open spaces should not be located in the corners of developments where visibility and supervision are at a minimum unless there is a possibility of linkage with other adjacent properties in the future or other factors make such location appropriate cresidential open space activities open space should be designed to accommodate a wide range of activities ages and abilities at least half of the open space within a development must be usable for active recreation an open space shall include some or all of the following depending upon size conditions and context of the open space 1play equipment such as slides swings or play structures 2a paved hard court for activities such as basketball volleyball pickleball tennis etc 3an open grassy area for active play 4an area for passive recreation such as walking or sitting 5other elements such as benches paths picnic tables or shelters 6pet waste stations 7pedestrian plaza 8vegetated lid facilities such as rain gardens and bioretention and permeable paving lid facilities may not be used to meet active recreation requirements unless the design includes active use components as determined by the director or their designee dresidential open space layout layout of the open space depends on specific site conditions some general guidelines are as follows 1arrange play equipment and activity spaces in similar groups rather than as isolated pieces of equipment make sure that the equipment is appropriate to the target age group 2plan traffic flow to link activities in a safe orderly manner this can be done plantings or benches provide an unobstructed view between elements 3place play equipment near deciduous shade trees to prevent pieces from getting too hot 4provide adequate buffer zones around elements to protect children in the area 5place swings toward the outside of the open space to discourage children from walking into them while in use for greater safety there should be no more than two swings per structure 6orient play courts north to south for player safety 7avoid placing play courts under trees to minimize problems with debris moss and slick surfaces 8provide adequate drainage throughout the open space 9place a low fence if necessary around the entire lot to prevent children from running out into the street 10pet waste stations shall be sited in open space areas and located nearest to the rightofway  also station locations shall be placed away from stormwater pond and children play equipment areas ecommercial open space the requirements for commercial open space may be different than residential areas because of the different needs and emphasis of open space in commercial areas in mixed use areas the various open space needs may be balanced by blending several open space techniques to achieve all required functions open space in commercial and mixed use areas may be landscaped hardscaped such as plazas or a combination of both in commercial areas open space will emphasize areas to relax preservation of trees landscaped parks or uses providing a pleasant stimulating experience for

finds that awetlands and their buffer areas are valuable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion soil liquefaction potential and septic disposal limitations bin their natural state wetlands provide many valuable social and ecological services including 1controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or regulating natural flows  2protecting water resources by filtering out water pollutants processing biological and chemical oxygen demand recycling and storing nutrients and serving as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation  3providing areas for ground water recharge  4preventing shoreline erosion by stabilizing the substrate  5providing habitat areas for many species of fish wildlife and vegetation many of which are dependent on wetlands for their survival and many of which are on washington state and federal endangered species lists  6providing open space and visual relief from intense development in urbanized area  7providing recreation opportunities  and 8serving as areas for scientific study and natural resource education cdevelopment in wetlands results in 1increased soil erosion and sedimentation of downstream water bodies including navigable channels  2increased shoreline erosion  3degraded water quality due to increased turbidity and loss of pollutant removal processes  4elimination or degradation of wildlife and fisheries habitat  5loss of fishery resources from water quality degradation increased peak flow rates decreased summer low flows and changes in the stream flow regimen  6loss of stormwater retention capacity and slow release detention resulting in flooding degraded water quality and changes in the stream flow regimen of watersheds  7loss of ground water recharge areas  8loss or degradation of open space and natural aesthetics of wetland areas  9loss or degradation of natural recreation opportunities provided by wetland areas  10loss of opportunities for scientific study of wetland areas dbuffer areas surrounding wetlands are essential to maintenance and protection of wetland functions and values buffer areas protect wetlands from degradation by 1stabilizing soil and preventing erosion  2filtering suspended solids nutrients and harmful or toxic substances  3moderating impacts of stormwater runoff  4moderating system microclimate  5protecting wetland wildlife habitat from adverse impacts  6maintaining and enhancing habitat diversity andor integrity  7supporting and protecting wetlands plant and animal species and biotic communities  and 8reducing disturbances to wetland resources caused by intrusion of humans and domestic animals ethe loss of the social and ecological services provided by wetlands results in a detriment to public safety and welfare  replacement of such services if possible at all can require considerable public expenditure fa considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or degraded by draining dredging filling excavating building polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost despoiled or impaired by such acts git is therefore necessary for the city of lacey to ensure maximum protection for wetland areas by discouraging development activities in wetlands and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect wetland functions and values to encourage restoration and enhancement of already degraded wetland systems and to encourage creation of new wetland areas   purpose ait is the policy of the city of lacey to require site planning to avoid or minimize damage to wetlands wherever possible  to require that activities not dependent upon a wetland location be located at upland sites  and to achieve no net loss of wetlands by requiring restoration or enhancement of degraded wetlands or creation of new wetlands to offset losses that are unavoidable bin addition it is the intent of the city of lacey that activities in or affecting wetlands not threaten public safety cause nuisances or destroy or degrade natural wetland functions and values by 1impeding flood flows reducing flood storage capacity or impairing natural flood control functions thereby resulting in increased flood heights frequencies or velocities on other lands  2increasing water pollution of domestic waste disposal systems or stormwater systems in wetlands  unauthorized application of pesticides and herbicides  disposal of solid waste at inappropriate sites  creation of unstable fills  or the destruction of wetland soils and vegetation  3increasing erosion  4decreasing breeding nesting and feeding areas for many species of waterfowl and shorebirds including those rare and endangered  5interfering with the exchange of nutrients needed by fish and other forms of wildlife  6decreasing habitat for fish and other forms of wildlife  7adversely altering the recharge or discharge functions of wetlands thereby impacting ground water or surface water supplies  8significantly altering wetland hydrology and thereby causing either short or longterm changes in vegetational composition soils characteristics nutrient cycling or water chemistry  9destroying sites needed for education and scientific research such as outdoor biophysical laboratories living classrooms and

revegetation plan satisfies the requirements for tree tracts pursuant to this chapter       additional considerations for commercial developments commercial projects generally have different demands than residential areas commercial sites have parking lots to serve the traveling public they have larger buildings and they may have need of significant utility infrastructure to service commercial uses while lacey has the same goals to maintain our tree canopy and to save significant stands of trees urban forestry requirements for commercial areas need to be crafted to acknowledge and plan for differences in site design and construction requirements in addition to other requirements of this ordinance commercial sites shall have emphasis on the following considerations and requirements aearly planning prior to project design shall consider the stands of trees on the site for a land use application to be considered complete a tree inventory with consideration of urban forestry issues shall be required to be submitted with the land use application the tree inventory and evaluation shall be utilized in the design layout of the site existing trees and protection opportunities shall play an important role in site design  bthe major strategy for tree protection on commercial sites will be designation of a tree tracts pursuant to the requirements of lmc  analysis and recommendations of the tree protection professional will determine if certain individual trees should have special emphasis based upon their health and significance individual site conditions and retention opportunities a review of these recommendations shall be provided in the tree protection professionals report  cthe selection of the location of the tree tracts and individual trees shall be chosen early on at the presubmission stage before design of the site and it shall consider the best location of the site to address urban forestry issues the design of the commercial site layout shall work within the framework of tree protection opportunities for designation of the tree tract and individual trees  ddeciduous trees are generally encouraged for parking areas because of advantages for solar access considerations shading in summer and solar access in winter temperature and climate control factors reducing temperature in parking lots in summer pollution control advantages broad leaves absorption of gases and removal filtering of particulate matter and options for providing tree canopy coverage over parking sites and drive lanes select deciduous trees can also be chosen for root character that will not damage asphalt and parking lot overlays for these advantages planting of select deciduous trees will generally be a good choice to provide canopy coverage in parking lots for commercial sites over the long term it is also important to restore some native conifers to the project site this can occur in larger planter islands or as a backdrop to buildings or as foundation plantings to breakup concrete facades the tree protection professionals report shall reflect these considerations shall indicate the best areas for removal of trees to accommodate parking needs based upon indigenous tree areas with the least protection value and shall recommend replacement of trees  ein some cases commercial sites may require extensive grading because of the nature of the topography and other development requirements for this reason and the emphasis on provision of a designated tree tract to achieve canopy goals some flexibility may be permitted for grading to provide for intensive infrastructure needs of the project design provided the design takes advantage of tree protection opportunities to provide an attractive functional and unique shopping experience this flexibility is not intended to limit creative development with the site where possible commercial developments should seek to use variations in terrain to create an interesting development scheme   historical trees apurpose the purpose of the historical tree designation is to protect trees with a historical significance and to establish a register of these trees historical trees require protection due to their special value in that they are irreplaceable they may be associated with historic figures events or properties  or be rare or unusual species  or they may have aesthetic value worthy of protection for the health and general welfare of the residents of this city therefore the purpose of this section is 1protection and maintenance to provide for the protection and proper maintenance of historical trees to minimize disturbance to the trees and to prevent other environmental damage from erosion or destruction of wildlife habitat  2health safety welfare to protect the health safety and general welfare of the public  3goals and objectives to implement the goals and objectives of the citys urban forest management plan bhistorical tree registration the city shall

building and landscape frontage type 1linear building frontage a linear building frontage as set out in figure 1 is characterized by a facade that is built up to the buildto line the building entrance is at sidewalk grade except where there are ground floor residential uses linear building frontages have substantial glazing on the ground floor and often provide awnings or canopies cantilevered over the sidewalk building entries must either provide a canopy or awning andor be recessed behind the front building facade 2forecourt building frontage a forecourt building frontage as set out in figure 2 may be created by recessing a portion of the facade for a portion of the building frontage the forecourt building frontage should be used in conjunction with the linear building frontage a forecourt building frontage is suitable for commercial or residential uses a forecourt building frontage may be suitable for gardens andor outdoor seating 3porchstoopterrace building frontage the porchstoopterrace building frontage as set out in figure 3 is characterized by a facade which is set behind the buildto line and a building entry threshold such as a porch or terrace set between the building and the buildto line the threshold may be elevated above or sunken below grade the building entry is accessed from this threshold landscaping may be provided in the setback area between the building and the sidewalk a porchstoopterrace building frontage is suitable for residential uses and service commercial or office uses 4landscape building frontage a landscape building frontage as set out in figure 4 is set back from the buildto line by a wide landscaped strip between the building and the sidewalk this frontage type is appropriate along streets where the existing streetscape may not be conducive to pedestrianoriented ground floor retail or residential uses such as where there is no onstreet parking or where streets are very wide ground floor entries must still be provided along and connected to the sidewalk 5low wall and trellis landscape frontage as set out in figure 5 buildto lines not occupied by buildings driveways or pedestrian paths must be screened with a low

interest of the village center residents       village center design aminimum area a minimum of sixty contiguous acres of land shall be required for a village center bneighborhood design 1opportunities and constraints analysis at the beginning of the design process an assessment should be completed evaluating special opportunities and constraints associated with the property designated as a village center such things as wetlands water bodies steep slopes tree resources unique physical features historical perspective surrounding developments solar access and other issues should be considered in evaluating potential neighborhood development 2a sense of place aeach village shall be designed to create a unique identity and sense of place this should be based upon a combination of natural features surrounding circumstances and special design natural features particularly sensitive areas should be emphasized to capitalize on the natural resource and build a special village identity bconsideration should be given to the villages relationship to the surrounding community how it fits in the function it provides in the larger community and special relationships to surrounding land uses cspecial design and architectural themes should be used to create or support the villages unique identity 3neighborhood focal points each village shall have key focal points which serve as the heart of the village such as a grade school central park commercial area or prominent open space with sensitive areas or a combination of such features the focus points

architecturaldesign considerations make it desirable blocks should be designed to range between two hundred to five hundred feet lanes shall be permitted to bisect blocks general orientation of lots and blocks shall consider solar access and design requirements 2variation of lot width and area lot areas and lot widths may vary at random in order to eliminate the appearance of a standardized subdivision cthe modified grid pattern and lots should be laid out in consideration of solar access if possible given other competing interests and issues dconnectivity is a primary emphasis key gathering areas and focal points of the neighborhood shall be tied together by pedestrian and bike lanes as well as streets etransit services shall be strategically located and designed to support village center activities 5architectural considerations the village should be physically united by common design features themes should be built upon the village focus point identity and sense of place the master plan should set the framework adopted design vocabulary giving guidance for plats and site plan review of individual projects this shall not preclude the possibility of multiple themes or architectural styles within distinct segments or portions of the village as long as all themes utilize community focal points and are consistent with neighborhood continuity requirements 6open space and community green anot less than fifteen percent of a village center shall be allocated to and shall remain in common open space in perpetuity additionally not less than fifty percent of the required open space must be usable for active recreation purposes wetlands priority habitat sites or other environmentally sensitive areas and resources may only count for up to fifty percent of the common open space requirement common open space shall be deed restricted to prohibit future subdivision or development except for agricultural or recreational uses which may be permitted with the approval of the city common open space shall be used for social recreational andor natural environment preservation purposes the uses authorized must be appropriate to the character of the common open space including its topography size and vegetation  as well as to the character of the development including its size and density the characteristics of the expected population and the number and type of dwellings to be provided bin most situations each village center should be designed to have one primary open space which shall be referred to as the community green refer to table 16t27 the community green shall have a minimum area of twenty thousand square feet and the size shape and design of the community green should provide adequate space for concerts outdoor exhibits and community gatherings based on the number of residents expected in the development permeable paving and vegetated lid facilities are encouraged in the community green the community green is normally surrounded by a concentration of high density development which may include commercial residential and public and semipublic uses community clubs and community facilities if the development includes a main street commercial area the community green shall either front upon a main street main street shall terminate at the community green or main street and the community green shall otherwise be incorporated into a combined community focus for the development nothing herein shall preclude a large tract from containing two or more separate phases with two or more separate community greens cthe community green should normally be centrally located and should normally be within comfortable walking distance of the majority of dwelling units in the development this is usually within a one thousand five hundred foot radius from the outermost boundary of the community green main street commercial area see also neighborhood design in subsection b10a of this section dispersion of densities and mix of uses dto the greatest extent possible common open space shall be adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas that can enhance open space options and opportunities such as wetlands priority habitats and other such critical areas as may be determined by the city erecreational facilities shall be required to serve the anticipated needs of the residents of the development taking into account the anticipated characteristics and demographic profile of the developments population the recreational facilities available in neighboring developments and the relevant provisions regarding recreational facilities contained in the comprehensive plan fthe construction schedule of the development shall coordinate the improvement of the common open space with the construction of residential dwellings at no time in the development of various phases of the village center may the total area of common open space in the developed phases be less than required to serve the developed portion 7density aresidential density the maximum allowable number of units and corresponding nonresidential uses shall be determined by a development analysis considering land characteristics neighborhood characteristics and market variables emphasis shall be placed upon achieving density necessary to promote transit along major transportation corridors according to the transportation plan  currently thought to be a minimum of seven units per acre to the extent possible the highest reasonable density should be allowed in development of the village center transfer of development rights if available and other bonuses should be employed when possible a village center is required to develop with density ranges of three to twentyplus du per acre a twentyfive percent increase in the number of units above the normal zoning designations may be allowed  provided that a minimum of thirty percent of the total bonus units are set aside for households of moderate to low income to the extent possible these units should be slated for ownership with the conditional provision of subsequent sales limited to cost of living increment assigned and improvement equity according to the citys affordable housing policies as may be adopted or are hereafter amended bcommercial density and timing the commercial density of a village center shall be appropriate to provide commercial service to the village center and adjacent neighborhood consistent with a neotraditional concept anticipating that the commercial portion of the village center may not be economical until the residential portion is constructed timing of the commercial portion shall be left to the discretion of the applicants provided designated property for commercial use according to the binding master plan shall be reserved for such use 8residential dwellings functions and types aa range of residential dwelling types shall be provided in the village center the number of single family attached and detached structures

seventyfive percent should be the same type of dwelling unit eg duplexes or apartments provided the city may approve any ratio and mixture of housing if it believes such will be consistent with the intent of the neotraditional concept and such mixture or ratio will provide a market situation necessary or desirable for the betterment of the community bsingle family residences can offer a range of lot sizes and densities from larger homes with larger lots to smaller compact homes utilizing zerolot line concepts with most of the advantages of single family homes but at densities that are high enough to support nearby retail and transit services cduplexes are two units attached at their sides they achieve higher densities while providing single familystyle rental opportunities with few side yards duplexes can create a formal sense of enclosure for streets and parks duplexes are encouraged close to the neighborhoods center but may be allowed in any zone within the village dtownhouses are attached at their sides with private front and rear yards they lend themselves to private ownership while achieving high densities with few side yards townhouses can create a formal sense of enclosure for streets and parks townhouses are encouraged in close proximity to the neighborhoods center but may be permitted in any zone in the village eapartments and condominiums will provide affordable rental housing or apartmentstyle ownership potential in close proximity to retail transit and public amenities buildings should address the street in a traditional way with entry porches porticos and bays a pedestrian connection is required to ensure a direct walking route to retail shops apartments and condominiums are permitted in all zones within the village with the exception of designated low density areas 9commercial functions commercial uses help to form the core of the village office uses should be located where employees will have good access by car and can walk to the core area for shopping restaurants local services and recreational amenities the office area can provide employment opportunities within the neighborhood and balance jobs and housing in the area the commercial and office uses should be designed to accommodate both pedestrians and automobiles with emphasis given to the pedestrian element and in particular pedestrians within the village village centers with a community commercial element may have more of an automobile orientation than those with a neighborhood commercial designation however both designations shall be designed with the major emphasis of providing a comfortable convenient and attractive shopping experience for local pedestrians 10dispersion of densities and mix of uses aresidential density residential density shall generally decrease from the community green andor centercore towards the periphery of the village center however a mix of dwelling unit types should be distributed throughout the development smaller lots and higher density dwellings are generally located closer to the community green and main street commercial area different dwelling units may be mixed in any distribution within any single block if desired a majority of the dwelling units should generally be located within a one thousand five hundred foot radius of the outermost boundary of the community green and main street or core commercial area refer to table 16t28 in implementation of this general standard consideration shall be given to the circumstances of the village both internal and external the ultimate design should be consistent with local conditions purposes and functions of the village a general radius greater or lesser than one thousand five hundred feet may therefore be appropriate bcommercial location and dispersion commercial components shall front on the interior streets of the village commercial uses can be mixed and integrated with dwelling units and public and semipublic uses community clubs and community facilities within the designated commercial area the greatest concentration of commercial development should be located around a community green andor within a main street commercial area if the development includes a main street commercial area the community green shall either front upon main street the main street shall be readily accessible to the community green or the main street and the

community green or main street commercial center shall mark the transition into such areas in a distinct fashion using massing additional height contrasting materials andor architectural embellishments to obtain this effect bfocal points or points of visual termination shall generally be occupied by more prominent monumental buildings and structures that employ enhanced height massing distinctive architectural treatments or other distinguishing features refer to table 16t31 buildings on corner lots shall be considered significant structures since they have at least two front facades visibly exposed to the street if deemed appropriate by the city such buildings may be designed with additional height and architectural embellishments such as corner towers to emphasize their

for residential development shall be considered at the design stage of residential and mixed use developments to define public and private spaces this can be achieved by physical design and layout defining such transition areas is important since there will be instances where residential units will be placed above commercial establishments or high density multifamily units heavily integrated with commercial uses alternatively providing transition areas can reduce the opportunity or invitation of crime in some cases just by site design transition spaces can be created by utilizing several different elements 1a change in pathway textures  2a low wall for plants or draping vines  3a change in pathway elevation  4use of a trellis or arbor any of the above listed elements can be used alone or in combination to create defined transitional spaces see table 16t42 security should also be designed into transition areas such as 1parking lot layout parking lot for residents should be located

it existed at the time of its final approval by the city council bthe gross floor area of the commercial use shall not exceed the product of thirty square feet multiplied by the number of dwelling units within the development the purpose of restricting commercial development is to prevent the prd process from being used as a vehicle for rezoning to commercial use which may not be at all related

which shall be either aheld in single ownership where such ownership assumes full responsibility for maintenance and operation  or bheld in common ownership by all of the owners in the development area  or cdedicated for public use if acceptable to the city 2common open space may contain such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of residents of the prd  provided that the building coverage of such building or structure combined with the building coverage of the residential structures shall not exceed the maximum permitted by the underlying zone 3up to fifty percent of the common open space requirement may be satisfied by the preservation of tall stands of trees andor wetlands andor critical area habitat and required critical area buffers in consideration of the significant passive recreation opportunities provided by said lands development shall be configured to take advantage of these areas as a significant site amenity these areas should be visually accessible to the public rather than walled off from view to the extent possible trail networks should be integrated with these areas for example a trail along the wetland buffer is a desirable option the remaining fifty percent of the common open space area must meet the criteria in subsection a4 of this section 4common open space must meet the following design criteria amust be useable and accessible all common open spaces intended for public use shall be physically and visually accessible from the adjacent street or major internal pedestrian route open spaces shall be in locations accessible to intended usersrather than simply leftover or undevelopable space in locations where very little pedestrian traffic is anticipated locations integrated with transit stops for instance would be encouraged as there is likely to be pedestrian traffic in the area bmust be inviting inviting open spaces feature amenities and activities that encourage pedestrians to use and explore the space on a large scale it could be a combination of active and passive recreational uses it could include a fountain sculpture childrens play area special landscaping element or even a comfortable place to sit and watch the world go by in order for people to linger in an open space it must be comfortable for instance a plaza space should receive ample sunlight particularly at noon and have design elements that lend the space a human scale including landscaping elements benches and other seating areas and pedestrianscaled lighting no use shall be allowed within the open space that adversely affects the aesthetic appeal or usability of the open space see table 16t83 cmust be safe safe open spaces incorporate crime prevention design cpted
