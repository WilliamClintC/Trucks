response or with a nov any significant noncompliance should be responded to with an enforceable order that requires a return to compliance by a specific deadline along with the applicable monetary penalties in determining the proper response to a violation whether significant or not the following criteria should be considered  magnitude of the violation  duration of the violation  impact of the violation on the receiving waters  impact of the violation on the potw  compliance history of the industrial user  good faith of the industrial user since pretreatment enforcement is a matter of

penalty assessed by the city for violations of pretreatment standards and requirements administrative change 5  appb9 penalties should be used as an escalated enforcement action and are punitive in nature and are not to be related to a specific cost born by the potw the amount of the penalty assessed should recapture any economic benefit gained by the noncompliance andor act as a deterrent to future violations determining the penalty amount which reflects the violations significance is very important if the penalty is too small its deterrent value is lost and the violator may regard it as a tax or nominal charge to pollute if the penalty is too great it could bankrupt the user making necessary investments in pretreatment equipment impossible and forcing unnecessary closure in cases of extreme hardship the superintendent or city administrator may consider reducing or suspending the penalty as part of a consent decree or show cause hearing each type of violation has been categorized and a range of penalties assigned to each category thereby allowing the responsible designated official to apply an appropriate monetary assessment all penalty assessments are to be assessed per violation per day unless otherwise noted category 0   no penalty category 1   $5000 to $50000 category 2   $50000 to $100000 category 3   $100000 to $500000 category 4   $500000 to $1000000 andor

updated change 5  appb21 on a weekly basis for each iu these worksheets will provide instant updates of the compliance status of the ius and allow personnel to flag noncompliance situations at a glance currently all permitted ius are sampled semiannually by the potw and submit discharge selfmonitoring reports on a regular basis to the potw demand monitoring is instituted when warranted a scheduled and an unscheduled iu facility inspection are performed semiannually by the pretreatment coordinator it is hoped that these actions will provide an effective means of tracking compliance status of ius quickly and instituting necessary enforcement proceedings in a timely manner the proposed time frames for initiating enforcement proceedings can be found in the enforcement response

principal effect that land development activities have on the natural or geologic erosion consists of exposing disturbed soils to precipitation and to surface storm runoff uncontrolled erosion and sediment from these areas often cause considerable economic damage to individuals and to society in general surface water pollution channel and reservoir siltation and damage to public facilities as well as to private property are some of many examples of problems caused by uncontrolled erosion and sedimentation the following are those measures and regulatory requirements which have been set forth for the purpose of controlling erosion and sedimentation caused by soil disturbance  definition of land or soil disturbance  any activity involving the alteration of topography or the shaping of land for construction development or excavation purposes which in any way alters the soil cover affects onsite drainage and storm water runoff affects drainage on offsite properties~ or alters natural drainage patterns or streams and streamflow characteristics  general planning guidelines  for erosion and sediment control program to be effective it is imperative that provisions for sediment control measures be made in the planning stage the following are guidelines which shall be used in practical combinations during the development and preparation of any erosion and sedimentation plan for any area being developed for residential industrial commercial recreational transportation or public and institutional uses a the development plan should be fitted to the soils and topography so as to create the least erosion potential b wherever feasible during construction natural vegetation should be retained and protected where inadequate vegetation exists temporary or permanent vegetation should be established c where land must be stripped of vegetation during construction limit the exposed area to the smallest practical size at any one time d limit the duration of exposure to the shortest practical time e critical areas exposed during construction should be protected with temporary vegetation andor mulching f permanent vegetation and improvements such as streets storm sewers or other features of the development capable of carrying storm runoff in a safe manner should be installed as early as possible camden municipal zoning g provisions should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development h sediment basins to remove suspended soil particles from runoff waters from land undergoing development should be constructed and maintained wherever erosive conditions indicate they are needed to prevent offsite damages i diversions grassed waterways grade stabilization structures and similar mechanical control measures required by the site should be installed as early in the development of the area as possible j earth cut and fill slopes of  or flatter are desirable for erosion control and maintenance the slopes shall not be steeper than 2 horizontal to 1 vertical unless stabilized by structural measures ex retaining walls cribbing etc  general criteria for controlling erosion and sediment  the general criteria is minimum requirements for controlling erosion and sedimentation from land disturbing activities these general criteria do not replace the requirement for individually developed erosion and sediment control plans  however they do establish minimum standards of soil conservation practice which apply to all land disturbing projects applicable general criteria shall be satisfied in each approved erosion and sediment control plan  however if a plan is found to be inadequate with respect to the general criteria in the field they apply in addition to the provisions of the approved plan unless a variance has been granted local inspectors and persons responsible for carrying out approved plans must therefore be aware of the general criteria as well as the provisions of the approved plans themselves nothing in the general criteria shall limit the right of the planning commission to impose additional or more stringent standards for controlling erosion and sedimentation when recommended by the town engineer during the plan approval process a stabilization of denuded areas and soil stockpiles 1 permanent or temporary soil stabilization must be applied to denuded areas within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site soil stabilization must also be applied within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain dormant undisturbed for longer than 60 days 2 soil stabilization refers to measures which protect soil from the erosive forces of raindrop impact and flowing water applicable practices include vegetative establishment mulching and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved soil stabilization camden municipal zoning measures should be selected to be appropriate for the time of year site conditions and estimated duration of use 3 soil stockpiles must be stabilized or protected with sediment trapping measures to prevent soil loss 4 throughout the implementation phase of any approved plan dust production from all activities shall be strictly controlled the person responsible for implementing the approved plan shall institute those dust control measures necessary to assure that adjacent properties are not adversely affected by dust b establishment of permanent vegetation  a permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved which in the opinion of the planning commission is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather conditions c protection of adjacent properties 1 properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be protected from sediment deposition this may be accomplished by preserving a wellvegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers filters or dikes or sediment basins or by a combination of such measures 2 vegetated buffer strips may be used alone only where runoff in sheet flow is expected buffer strips should be at least 20 feet in width if at any time it is found that a vegetated buffer strip alone is ineffective in stopping sediment movement onto adjacent property additional perimeter controls must be provided d timing and stabilization of sediment trapping measures  sediment basins and traps perimeter dikes sediment barriers and other measures intended to trap sediment onsite must be constructed as a first step in grading and be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place earthen structures such as dams dikes and diversions must be seeded and mulched within 15 days of installation e sediment basins  stormwater runoff from drainage areas with five acres or greater disturbed area must pass sediment basin or other suitable sediment trapping facility with equivalent or greater storage capacity the planning commission may require sediment basins or traps camden municipal zoning for smaller disturbed areas where deemed necessary this sediment basin requirement may also be waived by variance if the planning commission agrees that site conditions do not warrant its construction f cut and fill slopes  cut and fill slopes must be designed and constructed in a manner which will minimize erosion consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope the soil type upslope drainage area groundwater conditions and other applicable factors slopes which are found to be eroding excessively within one year of construction must be provided with additional slope stabilizing measures until the problem is corrected the following guidelines are provided to aid site planners and the town engineer in developing an adequate design 1 roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces on slopes 2 diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope diversions or terraces may also be used to reduce slope length 3 concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut or fill slopes unless contained within an adequate temporary or permanent channel flume or slope drain structure 4 wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers the stability of the slope adequate drainage or other protection should be provided g stormwater management criteria for controlling offsite erosion  properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion due to increases in the volume velocity and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff in the absence of local stormwater management criteria which have been approved by the soil conservation service the following criteria shall apply 1 concentrated stormwater runoff leaving a development site must be discharged directly into a welldefined natural or manmade offsite receiving channel or pipe if there is no welldefined offsite receiving channel or pipe one must be constructed to convey stormwater to the nearest adequate channel newly constructed channels shall be designed as adequate channels 2 an adequate channel shall be defined as a natural or manmade channel or pipe which is capable of conveying the runoff from a storm event the town engineer deems appropriate without overtopping its banks or eroding after development of the site in camden municipal zoning question a receiving channel may also be considered adequate to any point where the total contributing drainage area is at least 100 times greater than the drainage area of the development site in question  or if it can be shown that the peak rate of runoff from the site for a storm event the town engineer deems appropriate will not be increased after development 3 if an existing offsite receiving channel is not an adequate channel the applicant must choose one of the following options a obtain permission from downstream property owners to improve the receiving channel to an adequate condition such improvements shall extend downstream until an adequate channel section is reached b develop a site design that will not cause the predevelopment peak runoff rate from a storm event the town engineer deems appropriate to increase such a design may be accomplished by enhancing the infiltration capability of the site or by providing onsite storm water detention measures the predevelopment and postdevelopment peak runoff rates must be verified by sound accepted engineering methods and calculations c provide a combination of channel improvement stormwater detention or other measures which is satisfactory to the town engineer to prevent downstream channel erosion 4 all channel improvements or modifications must comply with all applicable laws and regulations modifications to flowing streams should be made in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations 5 if the applicant chooses an option which includes stormwater detention he must provide the town with a plan for maintenance of the detention facilities the plan shall set forth the maintenance requirements of the facility and the party responsible for performing the maintenance the responsible party may be an individual organization or the local governmentwhichever has consented to carry out the maintenance if the designated maintenance responsibility is with an individual or organization other than the local government~ a maintenance agreement should be executed between the responsible party and the local government camden municipal zoning 6 increased volumes of unconcentrated sheet flows which will cause erosion or sedimentation on adjacent property must be diverted to a stable outlet or detention facility 7 in applying these stormwater management criteria individual lots in subdivision developments shall not be considered separate development projects but rather the subdivision development as a whole shall be considered a single development project h stabilization of waterways and outlets  all onsite stormwater conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a 2year frequency storm without erosion stabilization adequate to prevent erosion must also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels i storm sewer inlet protection  all storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sedimentladen water will not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment j working in or crossing watercourse 1 construction vehicles should be kept out of watercourses to the extent possible where inchannel work is necessary precautions must be taken to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion the channel including bed and banks must always be restabilized immediately after inchannel work is completed 2 where a live wet watercourse must be crossed by construction vehicles regularly during construction a temporary stream crossing must be provided k underground utility construction  the construction of nonexempt underground utility lines shall be subject to the following criteria 1 no more than 500 feet of trench are to be opened at one time 2 where consistent with safety and space considerations excavated material is to be placed on the uphill side of trenches camden municipal zoning 3 trench dewatering devices shall discharge in a manner which will not adversely affect flowing streams drainage systems or offsite property  nonexempt utility construction includes the installation maintenance or repair of all utilities which disturb more than 10000 square feet except a individual service connections b telephone and electric lines c underground public utility lines under existing hard surfaced roads streets or sidewalks provided such land disturbing activity is confined to the area which is hard surfaced l construction access routes  wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads provisions must be made to minimize the transport of sediment mud by runoff or vehicle tracking onto the paved surface where sediment is transported onto a public road surface the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a sediment controlled disposal area street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner m disposition of temporary measure~  all temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or ~after the temporary measures are no longer needed unless otherwise authorized by the local program administrator trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation n maintenance  all temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function  erosion control measures  erosion control measures which may be used singly or in combination are indicated below together with brief statements of their site adaptation or limitations a vegetative protection  suitable for all soils capable of supporting plant growth vegetation alone will not provide adequate protection on soils camden municipal zoning that are unstable because of their structure texture internal water movement or excessively steep slopes vegetation protection is divided into 1 short term seeding to protect areas for 12 months or less 2 permanent seeding or sodding for areas to be protected longer than 1 year b to be used with all seedings on disturbed soil areas for temporary use without seeding during months unfavorable to seeding c grassed waterway  this type of control is a vegetatively lined channel designed to carry concentrated storm water such runoff may be flow which has collected in natural depressions or from diversions or from other site features grassed waterways should not be used for long duration base flows d diversions  a diversion consists of a channel or a channel with supporting ridge constructed across a sloping land surface on the contour or with predetermined grades to intercept and divert surface runoff before it gains sufficient volume or velocity to create harmful erosion it should have capacity to carry storm runoff and may or may not have a vegetative lining depending upon the velocities anticipated and the soil materials in the channel flow from a diversion must be discharged into a protected area or a grassed waterway e grade stabilization structures  these structures are used to reduce grade and to dissipate the energy of flowing water by dropping it in a relatively short horizontal distance by using these the grades and velocities in grassed waterways or bare channels can be reduced to noneroding limits this measure includes drop structures made of concrete corrugated metal pipe and other suitable materials f debris basins  these basins consist of an earth fill type dam and spillway in a drainageway downstream from a construction area for the purpose of trapping sediment and debris the basin must have an adequate capacity for all sediment or arrangements made to remove it mechanically as the basin becomes filled the whole structure may be removed after the construction area has become stable or may be retained to enhance the area g land grading  reshaping the ground surface by grading to planned grades and conformation that will be conducive to preventing excessive erosion camden municipal zoning h this measure controls erosion by reducing the surface runoff or lowering a high water table conduits or filter drains i sediment control measure  dike  a temporary means of trapping and storing sediment from eroding areas under construction in order to protect properties or stream channels below the installation from damage by excessive sedimentation and debris j urban stream bank protection  the control of bank erosion in main stream channels can be accomplished in various ways methods commonly used in urban areas include concrete sod riprap gabions and flexible fabric forms filled with mortar the purpose of bank control measures is to install a barrier that will withstand the erosive forces exerted by flowing water k urban gutter drain sediment barrier  these temporary bathers are used to prevent sediment from entering storm sewer systems prior to the establishment of protective soil cover the barriers are removed after the area under development is permanently protected against erosion by vegetative or mechanical means  erosion and sediment control plan a plan submission  no person may engage in any land disturbing activity until he has

subdivision regulations 1 are subdivision regulations fair to everyone yes the written regulations provide the local planning with uniform procedures standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plats for land subdivision 2 who is affected by the regulations every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels or changes the size of shape of existing lots 3 am i affected if i resubdivide my tract into two parcels yes subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes resubdivision 4 whats to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval the county register of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivision lying within planning regions without final approval in writing 5 can i sell by an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds no state law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by law to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale 6 what happens if i sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision a a state law has been broken tennessee  b some cloud would exist on the title to the lot c most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans d state law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers water mains lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads e where zoning is in effect a building permit to construct any building will be withheld camden subdivision regulations a12 f any building or structure reerected in violation may be forced to be vacated or removed g the legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction or other legal action 7 what improvements will i need to install in my subdivision most subdivision regulations will require the developer to grade and improve streets install curbs and sidewalks monuments sewers and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications 8 wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of money quite the contrary properly planned subdivisions make the most of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a maximum number of wellarranged and easier sold lots good land subdivision affects the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor while saving the developer money 9 how do i go about having a subdivision approved your local planning commissions printed set of regulations include the procedure for having a plat approved the planning commission meets at regular intervals and your preliminary sketch is submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered it is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area 10 what is i wish to lay out a commercial or industrial subdivision the provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivision of land including that for use of business and industry since space parking and service requirements will vary greatly it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses for that reason specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential areas 11 where can i get technical site planning assistance your planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision although they will not prepare final plans for you trained planners are available at the nearest office of the local planning assistance office
