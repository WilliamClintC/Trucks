as otherwise specified in wis stats    or  wis stats 5969 6062 6135 or 6223 applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter 2 the provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body 3 the board hereby designates the director to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter 4 the requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent requirements that may be imposed by any of the following a wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats 28116 and 28333 b targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under s nr  wis adm c  of the wisconsin state statutes 1002 findings of fact the board finds that runoff from land disturbing construction activity carries a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the waters of the state located within the village the board also finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding 1003 purpose and intent 1 purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to establish runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to a further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions b prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control village of suamico 10stormwater utility  of 33 adopted 6208 soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth c control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property 2 intent it is the intent of the board that this chapter regulates stormwater discharges to waters of the state this chapter may be applied on a sitebysite basis the board recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as

the possession of twentyfive 25 grams or less of marijuana is hereby prohibited 2 definitions marijuana shall have for purposes of this section the same meaning and definition as set forth in the provisions of wis stats 9610114 with the exception set forth in wis stats 961413g 3 defenses authorization of possession of marijuana under wis stats 96132 or wis stats  shall be a defense to any offense alleged hereunder 1178 possessionuse of tobacco and vapor products by minors 1 statement of purpose a the purpose of this section is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the village of suamico by prohibiting persons under eighteen 18 years of age from possessing tobacco products and vapor products and prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and vapor products to persons under eighteen 18 years of age b persons under age eighteen 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors there are new tobaccoless products however commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking these products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people c ecigarettes and similar devices are a relatively new nicotine delivery system while devices vary in their appearance and specific method of operation they have a few basic elements in common a solution of water dissolved nicotine and other ingredients usually flavoring is heated with a heating element usually batterypowered this vaporizes the nicotine solution which passes into a mouthpiece and is inhaled in a manner similar to cigarette smoking often glycerol or propylene glycol is added to the solution to give the appearance of smoke when the solution is vaporized the concentration of nicotine contained in the solution can be customized by the retailer to the buyers specifications and many manufacturers make nicotinefree solutions d the production and distribution of ecigarettes is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities and the us food and drug administration has not completed testing of these products but initial studies by the fda have determined that ecigarettes can increase nicotine village of suamico 11public nuisances  of 55 adopted 12108 addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks e the use of ecigarettes and similar devices has increased significantly in recent years f existing studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including 1 chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  2 pm 25  acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke g some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine h clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to the fda for the over four hundred 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers have no way of knowing whether electronic smoking devices are safe what types of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain and what dose of nicotine the products deliver i electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products j the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverses the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment k it is the intent of the suamico village board in enacting the ordinance codified in this section to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to minors l therefore the suamico village board determines that prohibiting the sale giving or furnishing of ecigarettes to minors and prohibiting the purchase possession or use of ecigarettes by minors is in the villages best interest and will promote public health safety and welfare 2 definitions for the purpose of construction and application of this section the following definitions shall apply a law enforcement officer the meaning given in wis stats30504s b minor means an individual who is less than eighteen

review standards for commercial multifamily and industrial development 1 design review authority a the village design review standards are adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in wis stat 6135 6223 and 6134 village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 b the review duties included in this ordinance are delegated by the suamico board to the design review committee 2 statement of intent a to encourage growth and development which is consistent with maintaining rural design character and protects and enhances the villages rural appeal for citizen and visitor use and enjoyment and protect against development which uses standard urban and suburban design approaches b to implement the goals and policies of the comprehensive land use plan to safeguard property values protect public and private investments and promote highquality commercial multifamily and industrial development which is consistent with rural character c to safeguard property values protect the public and private investments and promote highquality commercial multifamily and industrial development which is consistent with rural character d to develop and apply design review standards which do not overly restrict innovation and variety but are intended to facilitate and assist in focusing on design practices which result in development which sustain a positive rural design character e to protect against the problem of highway strip commercial development and to encourage welldesigned highway clustered commercial development f to have a minimum number of prescriptive standards and a maximum number of performance standards to allow flexibility in maintaining or enhancing rural character with new development 1 performance standards encourage flexibility and innovation of design in which more than one 1 solution is acceptable the proposals however must meet the range of positive photo examples performance strategy for natural and cultural resources and the criteria listed for each of the relevant design review standards 2 prescriptive standards dictate a specific type of design condition which is a requirement that is deemed necessary to meet rural character g to encourage landscape design which compliments the natural landscape improves the general appearance of the village and utilizes locally native plant species h to protect adjacent landowners from adverse or inappropriate aesthetic impact problems of new development which is not consistent with rural design character i to establish a formal review process which includes appropriate criteria for design review related to new or remodeled buildings site protection landscaping and site development j to maintain the appearance of design approved developments throughout the entire life of the development 3 applicability a the provisions of this ordinance are a furtherance of the land use and development controls of land in the village b all new commercial multifamily and industrial development within the village is subject to design review new development includes one 1 or more of the following types of development  building landscaping signage or parking areas landscaping is subject to design review when new buildings exterior alterations signage or parking is proposed new development does not include landscaping for minor additions to existing landscaping c design review approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit for new commercial multifamily and industrial development or for exterior wall and roof alterations to existing commercial multifamily and industrial development not previously subject to design review village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 d design review approval is required for exterior wall and roof alterations to existing commercial multifamily and industrial development which had not previously been subject to design review painting and the replacement of roofing are not considered design alterations if earth tone colors are used 4 design review standards a performance strategy for natural resource design review natural resources are significant in maintaining high quality aesthetic character for the village the villages desired future condition for commercial multifamily and industrial development is to locate and design new development which respects sensitive natural resources and places the development within or visually related to a forested or wetland setting in which the new development visually compliments the overall naturalness this is contrasted by development which dominates the setting and appears inconsistent with suamicos rural character b performance strategy for cultural resource design review a range of development types buildingsparking is acceptable if they are sensitive to the villages natural resources and contribute to the stated desirable living conditionsuncongested living  beauty peace and quiet  unspoiled rural atmosphere  lack of commercialism  a close friendly community feeling there is not one 1 architectural style or overall historic setting which always needs to be met however the desired future condition for new development is to fit into the existing rural character design and the use of materials colors landscaping and signage which compliment naturalness open space a clean appearance and maintain visual order in applying the standards and strategies the applicant has the burden of showing that the proposed development contains the necessary design qualities which will meet the natural and cultural resource strategies design standards while providing a sustainable positive rural character 5 open spacenatural resources design standards the intent of this section is to ensure that adequate open space and natural resources are incorporated into design solutions to provide an overall appearance of rural character a where open space natural resources or topographic patterns contribute to the beauty and utility of the area they shall be incorporated into the design of the new development b minimum green space which is required to be maintained on a given parcel shall typically be thirty percent 30% however its location and quality in which the green space is incorporated into the design of the development may allow reduction of that to twentyfive percent 25% combining of areasparcels will be considered in the overall green space provided they are under the same ownership and development is accruing on all parcels or in the same planned development overlay c to the extent possible existing topographic grades will be incorporated into the design however when grading or contouring the site the finished grades should appear naturally to the site and surrounding area protect the natural resources and adjacent properties d roadside trees are very important to the rural character of the community and shall be incorporated into the site plan if at all possible e waterfront development needs to be especially sensitive to water quality and riparian vegetation management the design emphasis needs to demonstrate the maximum protection of the natural shoreline along with transition area forest preservation a minimum amount of impervious development along with a village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 minimum level of lawn area would best meet the environmental and aesthetic qualities of rural character 6 existing built environment design standards the intent is to maintain the existing built environment which respects the design review standards and use these examples to serve as a base from which appropriate design solutions are proposed for commercial multifamily and industrial development a existing development can serve as a justification for new development only to the extent that the existing development meets the design review standards b existing development which does not meet the design review standards is encouraged to make changes towards the approved standards however this ordinance does not require changes unless the existing development meets the conditions in 3 7 relationship of building to site design standards the intent of this section is to incorporate into a site plan the design standards for commercial multifamily and industrial development in particular the site plan should integrate natural resources buildings parking and landscaping into a functional and aesthetic solution which respects desired rural character a the areas of green space must be located to provide resource protection transitions between adjacent sites and as a visual transition between the public roads and the building or parking lot b the arrangement of all functions uses and improvements must be designed to reflect positive rural characteristics c where appropriate the design solution should incorporate existing natural features such as forested areas streams wetlands and topography d the size shape scale and location of the structures need to be architecturally compatible with the existing site features e where appropriate the site design needs to integrate the proposed landscapingopen space into the adjacent landscaping open space or forested area f all mechanical equipment hvac exhaust fans etc shall be shielded from view by the use of fencing landscaping or possibly matching paint on roof top units other solutions may be considered g place underground all newly installed utility services and service revisions necessitated by exterior alterations h landscape buffers will be required between all commercial and residentially zoned properties buffers may consist of 1 a twenty foot 20 wide area with a variety of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs 2 a berm and fence with plantings 3 a berm with hedge type plantings 4 other solutions as determined appropriate by the committee i parking areas need to be carefully designated to fit the site and with sensitivity to location size and perimeter screening this is especially critical if the village is to maintain rural character rather than an urban community appearance the committee will review parking area site design performance which includes the following 1 in cases where quality forestland exists existing trees are preserved between the parking area and the rightofway 2 the location of the parking areas relative to the public roads and buildings should be placed at the side or rear of the building and away from direct public view 3 when options of side yard and rear yard parking do not exist front yard parking between the building and public road will require an effective landscape setback which includes extensive landscaping village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 4 parking areas with ten 10 or more spaces will require perimeter landscaping to visually reduce the adverse parking area impacts j new developments with large parking space requirements will need to demonstrate that they will not provide an urban parking lot appearance this will require design attention which locates the parking in the least visual impact area includes extensive perimeter landscaping interior plant islands maintains existing vegetation where appropriate and incorporates several smaller parking areas to meet parking space requirements landscape islands shall be incorporated into all parking areas in excess of ten thousand 10000 square feet required islands shall be a minimum of ten percent 10% of total parking area k trash receptacles shall be kept in enclosures constructed of the same materials as the main structure enclosures shall be large enough to conceal trash from view 8 building design standards the intent is to not restrict developments to a predetermined architectural style however for approval new developments must meet the design standards by clearly demonstrating how the building design maintains or enhances rural character the building design must avoid presenting an appearance of either monotonous similarity or excessive dissimilarity with appropriate existing structures the building standards are intended to prevent these extremes a architectural style is not restricted however extremes of style which do not fit rural character are to be avoided b building architecture needs to compliment rather than dominate the rural character setting of the village such as 1 wood brick stone and other natural materials are strongly preferred 2 earth tone colors are strongly preferred and color accents must be visually compatible 3 roofs with darker earth tone colors are expected 4 buildings which maintain colors style and setting of an earlier era will be considered c all sides of a structure shall receive full design consideration a facade unrelated to the rest of the building is not in keeping with acceptable design d all visually pitched roofs shall have a minimum of a six inch 6 fascia e all projections and mechanical details such as louvers exposed flashing flues vents gutters and downspouts are to be recognized as architectural features and shall be treated to match the color of the adjacent surface or an approved complimentary color f the design must avoid a monolithic big box appearance of frontages and rooflines the large box massing of such a structure must be diminished by breaking up building sections or by the use of such elements as variable planes projections bays dormers setbacks or changes in roofline g if the project is likely to become a village landmark or if it is in a visually prominent area or if it is located so as to become part of the villages gateway the design must acknowledge the special impact the project would have on the entire community by addressing the design solution in an exemplary manner h the signage and lighting fixtures must be compatible with the architectural design i the clustering of smaller visually compatible commercial structures is desired over singular large structures j in very limited situations smaller isolated retail buildings may contrast in color ie white or style english tudor or village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 theme christmas house with the more dominant rural character expectation however in these limited situations the applicant must explain why these design expressions are essential to their business and demonstrate that the new development will 1 include a landscaped backdrop or become part of a rural setting 2 include well maintained landscaping 3 be visually separated from other areas ie not part of visually continuous highway development pattern 4 be a very small structure and present a cottagelike appearance k new building development must avoid 1 the look of franchise architecture 2 buildings which advertise by appearance ie storage buildings 3 buildings which demand visual attention use of bold colors and materials which are not found to be positive in meeting rural character 4 buildings in commercial or industrial areas with the appearance of large metal buildings which lack design details or are otherwise without the positive attributes of rural character 5 the appearance of the big box visual character 9 landscaping design standards the intent is to provide a landscape design which preserves existing natural vegetation and incorporates additional locally native plants which compliment the plant communities and ecosystem of the area the aesthetic intent is to improve the appearance of all areas green space into the development in ways that harmonize and enhance the natural as well as the manmade environment and respect the principles of naturalistic landscaping the design review plan should indicate a a dominant visual character for the landscape design which maintains or creates a strong appearance of rural character it should avoid a design concept which creates a suburban or urban visual character b the size species and location of plant materials to be retained or placed on the site c areas to remain in natural state shall be identified on the site plan all other areas shall be properly maintained as designated on the plan d the percentage of the site which will be maintained in green space and the green space setback distance between the highway property line and the building andor parking lot e as appropriate planting concepts which meet the needs of front yard plantings building entry plantings building corner plantings larger parking lot interior plantings plantings related to signage and buffer plantings at the property edge which effectively screen within three 3 years what the committee deems incompatible land uses f the planted size of shade trees should be not less than one inch 1 diameter measured six inches 6 above ground and eight feet 8 in height  conifers evergreen trees should be at least four feet 4 in height shrubs should be of good nursery stock and provide effective landscape development within three 3 years of planting g plant material which provides interest in structure texture color and its ultimate growth pattern trees and shrubs which are exotic cultivars and provide highly showy aesthetic patterns such as red or bronze summer foliage or variegated leaf patterns are to be avoided h plants which are native to the area and provide a rural appearance village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 botanical name common name trees acer

designer that the variety fits well with the landscape design 10 exterior lighting design standards the intent of the exterior lighting design standards are to provide the necessary lighting which reflects rural character by intensity location placement color and overall design integration with the total development rather than lighting which is typical of urban conditions a all exterior lighting should balance onsite needs of safety security and aesthetic affects without adverse effect upon neighborhood properties especially residential property b all exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural and landscape design concept in color location and type of lighting c in general the height of exterior lighting fixtures shall not exceed the height of the building to which it relates parking lot lights shall not exceed twentyfive feet 25 tall and would typically be of the sharp cutoff type all service wall packs shall be shielded or directed downward d the height location and direction of lighting must be designed and located such a manner as to be shielded from the village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 direct view of the highway user and shielded above to reduce night sky illumination e sign lighting concepts which provide direct illumination from a shielded light source rather than interior sign lighting are preferred 11 signage design standards the intent is to encourage creative distinct and effective signs which are appropriate for the individual proprietors yet meet the community design standards for rural character and promote a positive signage image the design standards are intended to foster signage which respects the residential rural and scenic open space character of the village sign design review is limited to the aesthetic and appropriateness of sign appearance and is separate from the conditions included in the villages sign ordinance the following concepts and standards will be used to review signs for design approval a identification of businesses from moving cars must be balanced with the visual impact of signs on the rural landscape restraint in site design can aid in identification since small simple signs identify business with less confusion limiting counterproductive sign competition protects the quality of the landscape b every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it principally relates and where appropriate to rural character shall be compatible with signs on adjoining premises and not compete for attention 1 sign type the first 1st step in site design is selecting the most appropriate type of sign the three 3 most common types of signs are wall signs projecting signs and free standing signs the choice of sign type depends upon the surroundings and the attention one desires to attract for example free standing signs are best used in situations where there is a large setback from the road where the attention of people in fastmoving vehicles is being sought or where there are several uses in one 1 building or complex projecting signs and wall signs are best used where the attention of people in slowmoving vehicles or pedestrians is desired free standing style signs are preferred and elevated free standing signs are discouraged 2 sign message whatever sign type is used simplicity is the key factor to good design and readability an effectively designed sign utilizing bold easilyrecognized symbols and clear crisp lettering will identify a business or activity efficiently and attractively enhance the area in which it is located and compliment the general appearance of the village pictures and symbols can add individuality and character to signs in addition to making them easier to read the most common problems in commercial areas are an overabundance of signs that are often excessively large all of which contributes to sign overload this creates a visually chaotic situation in which no one 1 sign gains the advantage since the competing signs tend to cancel each other out in an unsuccessful bid to catch the buyers eye 3 sign color restraint should be exercised when selecting colors on most signs no more than three 3 colors should be used  one 1 for background preferably dark a contrasting color for the lettering and a third 3rd color perhaps for emphasis such as for borders motifs or shading lettering to give it a threedimensional look exceptions occur when an illustration is incorporated in the sign in such cases it is important that complimentary colors be used in selecting the principle colors for a sign colors which compliment the general tone of the building as needed 4 sign materials signs made of wood or other natural materials are preferred bases of free standing signs shall be of like materials to the building village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 5 signage landscaping free standing signs will generally require low and medium height plants to provide a positive design appearance for the sign and site appearance 6 master sign plan when more than one 1 sign is proposed for a parcel the applicant must submit for approval all of the proposed and existing signage the intent is to develop and follow a coordinated sign plan with regard to a color scheme b lettering or graphic style c lighting d location on each building or the site e signage material f sign proportions 12 relationship to adjacent sites design standards the intent of this section is to achieve design appearance compatibility among separate individually owned parcels which visually appear as one 1 continuous development the applicant has the burden of clearly demonstrating how the proposed project has the aesthetic qualities to meet the visually continuous compatibility test design solutions might include a proposing a building which is similar or compatible in design style materials color and landscaping with the adjacent development which meets the intent of positive rural character b situations in which the architectural expressions are different and yet acceptable to the standards strive for a strong landscape transition between properties using trees and shrubs or existing natural vegetation which reduces the visual dominance of the buildings c situations in which the land uses are incompatible or the adjacent development is below the minimum standards for rural character in this case the new development should develop a landscape plan or utilize existing vegetation to fully buffer the adjacent property from view d project features which are judged to have negative visual impacts upon adjacent properties such as parking lots service entrances loading zones mechanical equipment and storage areas shall be buffered from view of adjacent properties 13 application appeal completion and performance assurance the applicant must obtain a copy of this document and review the design assessment photos for both positive and negative examples of rural development character the photos are available for review at the village hall or as directed a application process 1 applicants must submit a completed application and eight 8 copies of the required information listed in to the zoning administrator fourteen 14 days before the regularly scheduled public meeting of the committee 2 the committee has fortyfive 45 days from the time a completed application is received to act on the application a completed application must respond to all of the appropriate requirements of this ordinance failure to approvedeny the application in the required time will result in the automatic design approval of the project as submitted however the committee may elect to defer official action which goes beyond thirty 30 days if more information is needed and the applicant agrees to the extension 3 the applicant must be available to present and explain how the project meets the design conditions of rural character the committee reviews the materials and approves as presented approves it with conditions or denies the applicants project proposal b appeal process the intent is to reach design review agreement between the applicant and the committee in the event that the applicant finds the decision or action inappropriate an appeal may be taken to the village of suamico 16building of 39 adopted 12108 board such an appeal shall be initiated by a written request to be placed on the board agenda for consideration the appeal must include the action being questioned and the specific grounds upon which the appeal is made such request must be received by the board no later than thirty 30 days after the date of denial the board shall conduct a review and within thirty 30 days make a finding which either affirms affirms with conditions reverses or reverses with conditions the finding by the board shall be final subject to judicial review c completion requirement the applicant must begin and substantially complete an approved project within two 2 years from the date of final approval if the project is not completed within the required time the design review approval expires d performance assurance 1 landscaping or other site improvement required pursuant to an approved design review plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy or final inspection unless the property owner submits a

that overall density within the subdivision is maintained the remaining undeveloped area within the subdivision provides open space and helps preserve the scenic and natural qualities of the land being divided especially any applicable environmentally sensitive area grouping of residences will facilitate common water and sewage disposal systems village of suamico 17subdivision of 21 adopted 12108 and encourage the improved use of the land respecting the preservation of natural resources 3 applicability any subdivision or csm where the total area of the land to be developed is at least five 5 acres may follow conservation subdivision design other land divisions with less than five 5 acres may be considered for conservation subdivision design with special approval of the village 4 site analysis plan as a part of the concept plan phase described under a study of existing site features shall be prepared and provided to the village prior to the onsite inspection this site analysis must include the following a a topographic map based on a usgs quadrangle map or aerial topography at not less than two foot 2 contours  b soil boundaries as shown on the brown county soil survey maps

preliminary plan which shall show the tentative location of houses streets lot lines and greenway lands 5 general requirements proposed conservation subdivisions shall be platted in accordance with the requirements and procedures of this chapter and the following requirements a density the maximum permitted number of lots in such developments shall be determined by dividing the total adjusted tract acreage by the minimum lot sizes required in the suamico zoning an alternate method the total number of lots within a conservation subdivision may be based upon a yield plan showing how many lots could be attained if the land were platted using the standard lot size and lot width such yield plan shall be subject to village approval and every lot shall be viable for development to be counted greater density may be permitted based upon 5 b described below b water and sewer water supply and sewage disposal shall meet the minimum standards of all state county or village regulations c design the design standards as contained within this chapter may at the discretion of the board be relaxed as an incentive in developing conservation subdivisions standards that can be relaxed in order to permit more creative land division design include but are not limited to lot shape and depth length of culdesac roads and road rightofway width however the lots shall be of sufficient size to provide buildable room for reasonable development based on the intended use d trail connections if pedestrian trails are included within any conservation subdivision such trails may at the developers discretion be connected to any regional pedestrian trails established by the village brown county any adjacent community or the state of wisconsin subject to approval by the owner of the trail 6 open space requirements a open space required for conservation subdivisions shall be based upon the contour character and aesthetics of the land being developed and may include both primary and secondary

primary conservation areas shall be included within the permanent open space to the extent practical 3 of the area gained as a result of reduced rightofway widths or lots less than the normal minimum area at least twothirds 23 shall be included as additional open space the remaining onethird 13 may be used for additional platted lots above the density prescribed in 4 a above c the minimum required open space may include storm water management facilities active recreation facilities and manmade ponds however not more than fifty percent 50% of the required open space shall consist of active

sufficient to allow for the intended use such as agriculture natural resource protection recreation stormwater management etc 7 evaluation criteria the village planning and zoning commission and board shall evaluate proposed conservation subdivisions to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan effectively meets the following criteria a the conservation subdivision design should identify and to the extent possible preserve all environmentally sensitive areas b the design should create sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and other uses c the development should be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by placing lots at the far edges of fields or by a planting screen consisting of a variety of trees shrubs and wildflowers d the conservation subdivision design should recognize and preserve where possible existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or meadows and should minimize impacts on large woodlands greater than five 5 acres especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to situate all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no village of suamico 17subdivision of 21 adopted 12108 large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent practicable e the conservation subdivision design should leave scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public thoroughfares in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be provided to preserve existing vegetation f the conservation subdivision design should respect and preserve sites of historic archaeological or cultural significance and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls barn foundations cellar holes earthworks and burial grounds g the conservation subdivision should protect rural roadside character and promote public safety and roadway carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly on or taking access onto collector or arterial roads h if the conservation subdivision design includes a pedestrian circulation system it should be designed to assure pedestrian safety and consideration should be given to providing a connection to adjoining properties or pedestrian trail systems i the conservation subdivision design should provide open space that is in a reasonably contiguous configuration fragmentation of open space should be minimized and not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development to the greatest extent practical open space should be designed as a single block with logical smoothflowing boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the area needing conservation is linear or unless such configuration is necessary as a trail connection or similar corridor j wherever possible the open space should generally abut or connect with existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such as in other subdivisions public parks or properties owned by or leased to private land organizations such open space may be designed as part of a larger contiguous and integrated parkway or system of trails 8 ownership of open space a ownership options different ownership and management options may apply to the permanently protected open space created by the development the open space shall remain titled

sensitive areas  2 according to the unique resource conditions at around and downstream from a given site  3 according to the principles of low impact development use source controls rather than endofpipe treatment reduce prevent and mitigate the adverse impacts of development by maintaining infiltration reducing frequency and volume of discharges reducing peak flows and maintaining groundwater recharge these goals can be accomplished by using reduced impervious surfaces functional grading to slow runoff and thereby lengthen the time of concentration vegetated channels rather than paving or pipes disconnection of impervious surfaces  drain to vegetated areas bioretention rain gardens and filtration buffer landscape areas any other techniques that reduce the runoff curve number rcn or increase the time of concentration tc use wet detention basins after all source area practices and techniques have been employed overall the goal is to design the site as an integral living part of the environment with careful use of principles and practices that are both low impact on runoff and simple for people to maintain and live with 4 to maintain groundwater recharge areas and the infiltration capacity of native soils by avoiding the unnecessary filling of large natural depressions or compaction of upper soil horizons by construction equipment  5 to maintain soil infiltration by keeping all topsoil onsite  6 to provide the protective area shoreland wetland and environmentally sensitive area setback along all water courses  and 7 according to the sequence in the treatment train a first do source controls reduce impervious areas to the maximum extent possible maintain undisturbed soil maintain existing trees shrubs and vegetation b next do lot controls grade lots to create long areas of overland flow rather than channels minimize directly connected impervious areas by such practices as directing roof water to vegetated areas and draining driveways to grass rather than the street include rain gardens undrained areas that will pond water c then do site controls use grassed waterways and diversions rather than paved channels maintain wetlands use vegetated road ditches rather than curb and gutter use wet detention basins they can have pools five 5 or more feet deep or may be designed as wetlands but existing wetlands cannot be incorporated
