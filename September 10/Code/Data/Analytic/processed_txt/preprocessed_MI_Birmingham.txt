requiring the replacement of lateral sewer lines when necessary and to bring them up to current standards when the city street over which the public sewer is located is open for repairs or reconstruction and access to the public sewer and lateral sewer lines are the most accessible for replacements this is to avoid unnecessarily reopening the city street in the future to repair lateral sewer lines and reconnect them to the public sewer so that the integrity of the newly constructed street can be maintained some of the existing lateral sewer lines are very old and are past or

of determining the integrity of said lines to allow a successful reconnection to the public sewer line during reconstruction 1 if the city engineering department has determined that the lateral sewer line meets the criteria for replacement set forth in the pslr the lateral sewer line will be replaced as a part of the street reconstruction project the cost of the sewer lateral line replacement will be at homeowner expense the cost may be eligible for inclusion in a special assessment district if one is established for this purpose if the lateral sewer line and building sewer line do not meet the criteria in the pslr for replacement and otherwise appears to conform to the city engineering department standards at the time of the street repair and its service life appears to warrant its continued use the existing lines connecting the house to the pubic sewer line may be utilized and maintained a determination that no replacement is required by the city at the time shall not serve or constitute as any warranty or representation as to the condition of the pipe or its continued suitability and the property owner may nevertheless opt to replace the lateral sewer line andor building
