designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the prior to development velocity by ten percent c acceptable management measures measures applied along or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences the commission recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results some alternatives are to 1 avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious 2 avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections 3 provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge these may range from simple riprapped sections to complex structures 4 protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion

it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity 6 energy dissipaters and outlet structures shall not be constructed in riparian buffer areas unless no practical alternative exists in any event there shall be no direct discharge of stormwater into watercourses d exceptions this rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater

residents of the town and the triangle region under the authority set forth in authority of this in ncgs 160a174 in addition the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of the north carolina general statutes entitled water and air resources directed local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare pursuant to the more specific requirements set forth in 15a ncac 2b 0100 15a ncac 2b 0200 and in the jordan water supply watershed nutrient management strategy rules 15a ncac 2b 0262 0311p also pursuant to the federal water

development with the exception of one and twofamily dwellings in the pudcz sdcz and tndcz planned development districts and the morr district  general compatibility requirement all development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the town by using a design that is complementary to existing town architectural styles designs and forms compatibility shall be achieved such as the repetition of roof lines the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces similar relationships to the street similar window and door patterns and the use of building materials that have color shades and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development 92 building aesthetics  purpose building aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures these regulations strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand while avoiding obtrusive incongruous structures on the other the town strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the existing character of the town the town supports the view that inspiring wellmaintained and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses  building design a emphasize human scale building design shall emphasize a human

level for instance brick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level d awnings and canopies awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are affixed e massing a single large dominant building mass shall be avoided where large structures are required mass should be broken up use of setbacks projecting and recessed elements and similar design techniques changes in mass shall be related to entrances the integral structure andor the organization of interior spaces and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect f avoiding garage dominance where garages are located in front of even with or to the side of a principal dwelling the width of garage doors on the house elevation facing the street shall not exceed 40 percent of the total width of the house and garage together g accessory facilities uses and devices that are ancillary to the primary building such as loading trash containment maintenance storage and

these functions and devices are fully contained and out of view from  design standards  building aesthetics  avoiding monotony of design   adjacent properties and public areas  avoiding monotony of design monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail form and siting to the maximum extent practicable within the standards set forth in this article to provide visual interest  harmony of design a purpose the purpose of this section is to preserve the design character of existing development to protect the visual pattern of the community and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings new buildings should respect the scale form and proportion of existing development this can be done by repeating building lines and surface treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail scale proportion texture materials color and building form figure a maintain scale and design character of local architecture b building color shades building color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the development the color shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood c building materials building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or if dissimilar materials are being proposed other characteristics such as scale and proportions form architectural detailing color and texture shall be utilized to ensure that

transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings g varying architectural styles in developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features similar scale and proportions and consistent location of signage 93 architectural character  purpose architectural character focuses on the microlevel details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development these architectural character regulations provide direction in aspects of color facade materials rooflines and the enhancement of entryways the primary goal is to define the finishing touches that provide the development with a sense of permanence style and compatibility the town actively discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account the town desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a good neighbor to its
