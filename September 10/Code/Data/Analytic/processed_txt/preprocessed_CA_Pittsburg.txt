insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 2 the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 3 it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots of existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of pmc  and  have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in pmc  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to the elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of contra costa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency c appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsection c1 c4 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b1 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  exh a 2016   1999 preservation of

compliance with government   regional transportation mitigation fee  findings and purpose a in order to implement the goals of the circulation element of the citys general plan and more specifically the transportation improvements contained in the capital improvement program and to mitigate the transportation impacts caused by new development in the city certain public road improvements must be or had to be constructed the city council has determined that a transportation mitigation fee is needed to finance these public improvements and to pay for new developments fair share of the construction costs of these improvements in establishing the fee described in this chapter the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its general plan and pursuant to government 2 has considered the effects of the fee with respect to regional housing needs and the citys housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan b the purpose of this chapter is to implement the general plan requirements set forth in subsections a and b of this section and under the authority of of the california constitution to impose a transportation mitigation fee to fund the cost of certain facilities and services the demand for which is directly or indirectly generated by the type and level of new development proposed in the city general plan c it is the further purpose of this chapter to require that adequate provision is made for developerfinanced facilities and services within the city limits as a condition to the approval of new development d a transportation mitigation fee is hereby established on issuance of a building permit for development in the city to pay for transportation improvements the city council shall in a council resolution set forth the specific amount of the fee describe the benefit and impact area on which the fee is imposed list the specific transportation improvements to be financed describe the estimated cost of these facilities describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various type of new developments and set forth time for payment e the specific transportation improvements to be financed by the fee are described in the most recent pittsburg local transportation mitigation fee ltmf program update adopted by council resolution and on file with the city clerk f new development will generate new trips which must be accommodated by transportation facilities the amount of trips generated and therefore the benefit gained varies according to the kind or use therefore a dwelling unit equivalent due factor was developed to convert the new trip generation rates for each general plan land use into as ratio of the particular uses rate to the rate associated with a lowdensity singlefamily dwelling

officer or city council in the event of an appeal becomes final  1992  compliance with government  the pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study contains information and analysis which the council finds provides substantial evidence for each of the following findings a the purpose of the fee adopted by this chapter is to provide a source of funding which will be used to construct roadway projects to mitigate citywide traffic impacts associated with new development occurring between 1990 and 2005 within the citys sphere of influence b the fee will be used to construct roadway projects throughout the city including street widening and improvements traffic signalizations new road extensions and connections overcrossings grade separations and similar improvements the project list in of the traffic mitigation fee study was used as a basis for estimating costs but is not intended as a limitation on the projects for which the fee can be used c each of the types of development projects upon which the traffic fee is imposed contributes to the increase in traffic congestion which is projected for the city the relationship between the level of traffic impacts and the type of land uses upon which the fee is imposed is based on trip generation rates published by the institute of traffic engineers for 1987 for each type of land use studied the study also relied upon the pittsburg transportation mitigation fee study 1989 this is described in more detail in appendix b of the 1992 traffic mitigation fee study since the fee will be used for roadway improvement projects which will mitigate these citywide traffic impacts the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee roadway improvements and the type of development projects residential commercial and industrial on which the fee is imposed d currently there is traffic congestion in the city and this congestion will continue to increase due to the development that is expected to occur in pittsburg and eastern contra costa county the need for the planned traffic model projections and the decreased volume to capacity ratios the improvements will increase the capacity of the transportation system to maintain the existing volume to capacity ratios without the projects there will be a degradation in the volume to capacity ratios these projections are presented in of the traffic mitigation fee study and in its attachments based upon this data the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the roadway improvements and types of development projects on which the fee is imposed e the traffic impact fee is being imposed on 12 types of development projects for each of those types of projects the traffic mitigation fee study calculated the appropriate fee amount based upon current estimates for anticipated project costs and the types of future growth projected by abag for the pittsburg sphere of influence these calculations are presented in table 3 of the study the distribution of the costs are based on trip generation rates for each land use classification which contributes to the degradation in volume to capacity ratios the cost of maintaining the volume to capacity ratios has been attributed by development type according to its relative contribution to the degradation in the ratio based upon this data and calculations the city council finds that the amount of fees attributable to the types of developments on which the fee is imposed represents a fair and reasonable distribution of the cost of the public facilities for each type of development project used in the study  1992  regional transportation mitigation fee in the event that any provision of regional transportation mitigation fee is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction then the pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study adopted under pmc  shall be amended to include the development program report for the

necessary under the terms of the jpa  1994  compliance with government  the development program report contains information and analysis which the council finds provides substantial evidence for each of the following findings a the purpose of the fee adopted by this chapter is to provide a source of funding which will be used to construct transportation improvements to mitigate citywide traffic impacts associated with new development occurring between 1994 and 2005 b the fee will be used to construct transportation improvements such as the construction of additional lanes improved median barriers wider medians and hov and mixed flow lanes on projects in the regional area including construction of the buchanan road bypass improvements to state route 4 between bailey road and the state route 4160 junction and construction of the state route 4 bypass or the delta expressway the project list on  of the development program report was used as a basis for estimating costs but is not intended as a limitation on the projects for which the fee can be imposed such projects shall be as determined under the jpa c there is a reasonable relationship between the fees use and the type of development projects on which the fee is imposed in that the types of development projects subject to the fee will generate additional traffic which will increase delays and further congest bridges and roadways in the regional area the additional traffic created by the development projects will result in a need to expand extend and improve existing transportation facilities and a need to construct new facilities to mitigate the adverse traffic affects that would otherwise result from such development projects since the fee will be used for transportation improvements which will mitigate impacts and reduce traffic congestion and delays and improve noise and air quality citywide and throughout the regional area the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee transportation improvements and the type of development projects residential commercial and industrial on which the fee is imposed d state route 4 between bailey road in pittsburg and the state route 4160 junction in antioch is a major access route for traffic throughout the regional area travelers on route 4 currently experience significant congestion and delays which are expected to increase significantly in severity as the result of projected development expansion of route 4 and construction of related improvements to junction 4160 will increase the flow of traffic reduce congestion delays and noise and improve air quality citywide and throughout the regional area based upon this data the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the route 4 expansion and related improvements to junction 4160 and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed e the construction of a new access route known as state route 4 bypass or the delta expressway extending from the junction of 4160 in antioch to highway 4 south of brentwood will reduce congestion and traffic decrease delays and noise and improve air quality throughout the regional area based upon this data the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between construction of the state route 4 bypass or the delta expressway and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed f buchanan road is a heavily used thoroughfare for commuter traffic accessing homes and jobs located within the regional area buchanan road is currently exceeding its capacity and travelers frequently experience delays and congestion which are expected to increase in severity as a result of projected development construction of the buchanan road bypass extending sommersville road to kirker pass road in pittsburg will reduce congestion decrease travel time and noise and improve air quality citywide and throughout the regional area based upon this data the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between construction of the buchanan road bypass and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed g the regional transportation mitigation fee is being imposed on five types of development projects for each of those types of projects the development program report calculated the appropriate fee amount based upon projected development and a trip generation factor designated for each of the five types of development projects these factors were determined utilizing the institute of transportation engineers ite trip generation manual 4th edition and results of the east county traffic model the traffic model indicates that nonresidential development may reduce the impact on the projects by creating a better employmenthousing balance as a result the proposed fee is directly related to traffic generated by each particular land use with nonresidential trip generation factors significantly reduced to approximately one tenth of the standard values in the ite manual based upon this data and calculations the city council finds that the amount of fees attributable to the types of development on which the fee is imposed represents a fair and reasonable distribution of the cost of the transportation improvements for each type of development project used in the development program report  1994

those provided the base density is interpolated between those indicated in the table c the average natural ground slope is s computed by the following formula where i   contour interval in feet l   summation of the length of all individual contours a   gross acreage of property in acres d the base densities in table i are based on an average singlefamily ground level surface coverage including garage of 2100 square feet per unit measured in a horizontal plane e when the proposed average ground level surface coverage of a development is less than or greater than the 2100 square foot average the base density from table i is adjusted as follows 2100 sq feet   base density from table i   adjusted base densityactual average level surface coverage per unit including garage f the total number of residential dwelling units permitted for a site is determined by multiplying the total acreage of the site times the base density in unitper acre from table i g for nonresidential structures within a residential development the equivalent number of dwelling units is determined by dividing the gross covered or uncovered ground level square footage including parking areas and garages by 2100 square feet the equivalent number of dwelling units for nonresidential structures is deducted from the total allowable residential units as calculated above h for a nonresidential development the base density from table i is used in determining the maximum ground level gross building coverage including parking areas the maximum gross building coverage including parking areas is determined as follows base density unitac  2100 sq feet   total acreage of site   maximum total ground level building coverage including parking areas 5 density bonus a the actual density of dwelling units that may

amateur radio facilities provide a voluntary noncommercial communications service of particular value to the community in providing emergency communications the city council further finds that the installation of amateur radio antenna systems unless regulated can adversely affect the safety and aesthetic values of agricultural residential commercial and industrial areas the intent of this chapter is to regulate the installation of amateur radio antenna systems in order to ensure maximum safety to the public and adjacent property owners to minimize visual impacts of the antenna systems on public rightsofway and adjacent properties and to accommodate the reasonable requirements of amateur radio operators within the city  exh a 1990  standards for all radio antenna systems every

exception to use permit requirement a this chapter is enacted based upon existing technology and the prevailing form and mass of radio antenna systems the city council recognizes that modern technology has the capability of changing rapidly and that radio antenna systems may be devised or developed which provide the same capabilities but comprise a form and mass which do not have the same physical characteristics or visual qualities as those existing the purpose of this section is to provide an administrative procedure which balances the interests of amateur radio operators with those of surrounding property owners in the face of radio antenna systems which have visual qualities different from those contemplated or which prevailed at the time the chapter is adopted b a person seeking approval to install an antenna system may request an exception from the use permit requirement of pmc  by complying with the following requirements 1 file the application required by pmc   2 submit a statement justifying an exception from the use permit requirement of pmc  by showing that the form and mass of the proposed antenna system is such that it meets the findings set forth in pmc d without the need of having to comply with specially imposed conditions  3 submit a supportive petition or consent form from property owners in the surrounding affected area c the planning director may either grant or deny the special exception or grant it with conditions if the planning director determines that the request may be controversial or is in doubt as to whether it qualifies for treatment as a special exception he may refer it to the planning commission for decision d the planning commission either grants or denies the special exception or grants it with conditions a person affected by the decision may appeal it to the city council  exh a 1990  enforcement a a person who violates this chapter is guilty of an infraction and shall be punished as provided in pmc  b a radio
