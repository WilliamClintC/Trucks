in unrestricted state aid to the school department 2 the town incurred over $21 million of losses in state aid in fy2012 alone and it anticipates having to expend upwards of $72100000 from its general fund balance in fy2012 to balance the budget 3 the towns unfunded liability arising out of the other post employment benefits opeb obligates the town to provide to current and future retirees is $3451072400 and growing and $1071828900 or 31% of that unfunded debt is attributable to the towns fire department 4 municipal services have been cut to minimize costs yet taxes have consistently increased by levels that residents cannot and should not have to endure most paid fire departments in america operate with a threedivision structure for line firefighting and rescue personnel 5 the town can realize an estimated reduction in costs of $12 million in its first full year of implementation by changing to a threedivision structure in its line firerescue operations without any layoffs or reductions in salaries with even greater savings expected reductions in overtime costs and the towns annual required opeb contribution 6 scientific studies show that a threedivision structure operating in conjunction with a shift schedule in which firefighters are onduty for 24 consecutive hours followed by 48 hours offduty enhances public safety and improves firefighter health and safety as compared with the division structure and shift schedule the towns firefighters currently follow 7 paid firefighters would reduce their work days on average to 100 days per year on a threedivision structure operating in conjunction with a 24 consecutive hours duty schedule 8 the town can increase the number of firefighters on duty by over 30 percent by having a threedivision structure and still eventually realize an estimated savings of over $12 million per year 9 similar savings can only be realized by effecting drastic and unacceptable cuts in public safety and other essential town services contrary to the public good and welfare 10 the same savings efficiencies and level of protection to the town could only be realized in the fire department by changing the nature of firerescue operations in the town including changing from an allprofessional fire department to one that includes volunteers call persons and private contractors 11 the citizens of the town already bear a property tax burden that is among the highest in the state per capita and cannot afford another large tax increase b effective  the town fire department shall convert and reorganize into a

prevention bureau training division fire alarm division and automotive repair division which may or may not be staffed with fulltime personnel as determined by the town council andor the town manager from time to time the department will continue to provide firerescue services 24 hours per day seven days per week c effective  unless a different arrangement is incorporated into an agreement with the collective bargaining representative of affected employees the same annual salaries increased by ten percent shall be provided  the same number of hours of paid sick leave paid vacation leave and other paid time off shall accrue to firefighters per week or month or year of service or event as currently is provided by the parties collective bargaining agreement  and overtime pay shall be given as prescribed by the federal fair labor standards act d effective  unless otherwise agreed between the town and the collective bargaining representative of affected employees the three line firefightingrescue divisions will operate on a regular schedule consisting of one tenhour day tour onduty followed by one fourteenhour night tour onduty followed by one 48hour period offduty e the town manager is urged and supported in exploring options and seeking bids for privatization of any or all functions of the fire department and for developing call and volunteer forces to perform some

sensitive site design low impact development techniques stormwater best management practices and good operation and maintenance at a minimum the annual recharge from the postdevelopment site shall approximate the annual recharge from predevelopment conditions based on soil type the applicant shall demonstrate that postdevelopment recharge rates approximate predevelopment conditions by following the calculation and design process described below the nrcs classifies soils into four hydrologic groups a indicative of the minimum infiltration obtained for a soil after prolonged wetting group a soils have the lowest runoff potential and the highest infiltration rates while group d soils have the highest runoff potential and the lowest infiltration rates each of these soils can be expected to infiltrate up to a certain amount of rainfall for any given rain event regardless of the size of the storm studies of rainfall data and soil recharge rates illustrate that the four hydrologic soil groups will recharge up to the following amounts for any given rain event hydrologic soil group potential rate of recharge event based a 060 inches of recharge b 035 inches of recharge c 025 inches of recharge d 010 inches of recharge therefore runoff from impervious cover must be recharged in accordance with the soil type that will be covered by that impervious cover the required recharge volume from impervious surfaces for any given storm the stormwater volume that must be infiltrated shall be determined by multiplying these recharge coefficients by the amount of impervious cover that lies above a particular hydrologic soil group an applicant must demonstrate to the planning commission that the stormwater management practices selected adequately captures treats and infiltrates the total required recharge resulting from these calculations for stormwater management strategies that recharge water root zone within the first 12 inches of soil it will be assumed that 50 percent of the captured runoff is lost to evapotranspiration the applicant shall therefore need to compensate for this loss in hisher recharge volume estimates where recharge occurs below the root zone it shall be assumed that all captured runoff will reach the water table sample calculation for stormwater recharge in the sample calculations provided below stormwater recharge facilities on the site must be capable of recharging at least 12124 gallons of runoff from impervious surfaces for any given storm event square feet of impervious cover required recharge 25000 over a soils 06 in  25000 sq feet    9350 gallons 12000 over b soils 035 in  12000 sq feet    2618 gallons 1000 over c soils 025 in  1000 sq feet    156 gallons 0 over d soils 0 total required potential recharge 12124 gallons square feet of impervious cover required recharge 4 stormwater recharge for redevelopment or constrained sites the town recognizes the difficulties associated with recharging groundwater on sites with certain unique constraints these constraints may include previously developed sites with considerable amounts of poor quality fill sites comprised entirely of hydrologic group c or d soils or sites with contaminated soils in these situations the recharge standards listed under section 2194b3 above shall be met to the maximum extent practicable for the purposes of determining compliance with this standard the planning commission shall require the applicant to demonstrate that a a complete evaluation was performed of all feasible infiltration measures including environmentally sensitive site design that minimizes land disturbance and impervious surfaces low impact development techniques reduced parking requirements and structural stormwater best management practices  and b if the postdevelopment recharge does not at least approximate the annual recharge from predevelopment conditions the applicant has demonstrated that heshe is implementing the highest practicable method for infiltrating stormwater 5 nonconformity preexisting nonconforming land or structures shall be governed by those provisions listed in article xii of the zoning ordinance in addition to those

zoning purpose the purpose of inclusionary zoning is to guide new development and reuse projects so that they support the towns goal of housing diversity consistent with the town comprehensive plan and with statewide planning and housing guidance the intention of these provisions is to assure that all new residential developments of five or more dwelling units will contribute to the supply of housing at affordable prices in the town to achieve that intention a share of the units resulting from such developments is to be affordably priced subject to a price limitation to assure initial affordability with deed rider or land lease assuring that purchasers or tenants incomes meet prescribed limits at the time of initial purchase or occupancy and that such affordability and income eligibility will again be observed at the time of future turnover the following is the towns preferred progression of affordable housing options 1 affordable units developed on site 2 offsite

type of land development project which utilizes prescribed site planning techniques to conserve open land protect site features and provide flexibility in the siting of structures services and infrastructure in a conservation development a percentage of the buildable land is set aside as open space in conformance with the comprehensive plan  buildings and developed areas are concentrated in specific areas on the site  and development plans are reviewed in accordance with procedures set forth within the subdivision and land development regulations under conservation development there is no increase in the number of lots or dwelling units that would be permitted under conventional subdivision or development except where ordinance provisions include incentive bonuses for certain types or conditions of development pursuant to and consistent with article ix of the zoning ordinance the purposes of this article conservation development are a to conserve open land including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands steep slopes streams floodplains wetlands aquifers and their recharge areas and agricultural lands by setting them aside from development  b to preserve historical and archaeological resources  c to provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure including sewage disposal systems and wells and to reduce length of roads utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential development  d to provide for a diversity of lot sizes building densities and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups and residential preferences so that the population diversity of the community may be maintained  e to implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally important resources as set forth in the comprehensive plan  f to provide reasonable incentives for the creation of a greenway system within the town  g to implement adopted land use transportation and community service policies as set forth in the comprehensive plan  h to protect areas of the town with productive agricultural soils to encourage continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm operations  i to create neighborhoods with direct visual andor physical access to open land with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space and with a strong neighborhood identity  j to provide for the maintenance of open land set aside for active or passive recreational use stormwater drainage or conservation lands  k to conserve and create scenic views and preserve the rural character of the town  l to provide a buffer between new development and existing streets neighborhoods active farmland and adjacent park or conservation land applicability the planning commission may allow conservation developments only in the zoning districts specified in article ix of the zoning ordinance and in accordance with all requirements and standards specified in said article procedures applications for conservation development approval shall be made in accordance with the procedures for approval of a major or minor subdivision or land development project based on the number of lots or dwellings in the development as provided in article 50 of these regulations design process the design of a conservation development shall follow the design process specified in the following steps when the master plan is submitted for major land development projects or subdivisions or preliminary plans for minor land development projects or subdivisions applicants shall demonstrate to the planning commission that this design process was considered in determining the layout of proposed streets building locations and open space a understanding the site the first step is to inventory existing site features taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural scenic and cultural resources on the site and to determine the connection of these important features to each other and strategies for protection this information shall be submitted in the form of an existing resources and site analysis map as specified in section 1317 of this article b evaluating site context the second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context by identifying physical eg stream corridors wetlands transportation eg street and bicycle networks and cultural eg open spaces recreational opportunities connections to surrounding land uses and activities this information shall be submitted in the form of a site context map as specified in section 136 of this article c designating the open space the third step is to identify the open space to be preserved on the site the open space shall include the most sensitive and noteworthy resources of the site and where appropriate areas that serve to extend neighborhood open space networks tofrom surrounding property the designation of open space shall reflect consistency with the comprehensive plan d location of building sites the fourth step is to locate building sites using the proposed open space as a base map as well as other relevant data on the existing resources and site analysis map the design shall take into account the potential negative impacts of residential development on nearby conservation areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences with emphasis on consistency with the towns rural character e alignment of streets and trails upon designation of the building sites a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each building complying with the standards of article 14 herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions f lot lines upon completion of the preceding 5 steps the final step is simply to draw in the lot lines to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots if applicable sketch plan overlay sheet the design process described above shall be documented by the applicant and presented to the planning commission to expedite this process a conceptual sketch plans for development shall be presented as overlay sheets to be superimposed on top of more detailed site surveys and environmental data at the same scale at the preapplication

information and surveys are not available a separate diagrammatic sketch plan may be presented at the preliminary stage of review for minor land development projects and subdivisions and at the master plan stage of review for major land development projects and subdivisions the sketch plan of development shall be presented as an overlay to the existing resources and site analysis map site context map a map showing the location of the proposed development within its neighborhood context shall be submitted the site context map which shall be superimposed on an aerial photograph shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 400 feet or as necessary to show the area within onehalf mile of the subdivision parcel it shall show the locations of all streets existing lot lines and zoning district
