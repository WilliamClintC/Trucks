city council finds there are a substantial number of sexuallyoriented businesses in the denver metropolitan area that require regulation in order to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizenry the city council and staff have conducted a review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses in other cities including 1 garden grove california 2 tucson arizona 3 austin texas 4 oklahoma city oklahoma 5 indianapolis indiana 6 houston texas 7 phoenix arizona 8 amarillo texas 9 los angeles california 10 new york new york  two studies 11 denver colorado regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses furthers substantial governmental interests and is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity has included prostitution narcotics and liquor law violations violent crimes against persons and property crimes sexuallyoriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature the concern over sexually transmitted diseases including aids is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of citizens sexuallyoriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas causing an increase in crime and a decrease in property values it is recognized that sexuallyoriented businesses have serious objectionable characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area the city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of citizens  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  deter the spread of urban blight and protect citizens from increased crime it is necessary to have a manager on the premises of sexuallyoriented businesses at all times that such establishments are offering sexuallyoriented entertainment in order to ensure an individual will be responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees the license fees required are necessary as nominal fees designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating sexuallyoriented businesses  the fees are related to the actual costs of regulation restricted hours of operation will further mitigate or prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of citizens and thus certain requirements with respect to the licensing and operation of sexuallyoriented businesses are in the public interest sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexuallyoriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexuallyoriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv offering sexuallyoriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions sanitary conditions in some sexuallyoriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexuallyoriented businesses where persons view sexuallyoriented films these findings raise substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexuallyoriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to ensure that sexuallyoriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexuallyoriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein the regulation of nudity in sexuallyoriented businesses will further these substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sexrelated crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare removal of doors on

district created there is hereby created a planned development district to further promote the public health safety and general welfare by permitting greater flexibility and innovation in land development based upon a comprehensive integrated plan for the purpose of ensuring maximum flexibility of this district the district is divided into the following planned development zone district categories based on the primary land use of a proposed development plan or portion thereof 1 planned residential developmentprd 2 planned commercial developmentpcd 3 planned industrial developmentpid 4 planned hospital developmentphd 5 planned mixed used developmentpmud the city council recognizes these zone district categories may exist singly or in combination within any approved planned development b applicability on and after the effective date of this chapter as set forth in section 261003 all applications for a zone change shall be to a planned development district where any one 1 of the following conditions exist 1 an application for a zone change to any commercial district with the exception of a rezoning to any mixed use district or to the industrialemployment zone district

taken together with the property that is the subject of the application totals more than one 1 acre this article shall apply to 1 any new application for a rezoning to a planned development district 2 any application for amendment to an existing planned development zone district c purpose the intent of the planned development district is to permit the establishment of welldesigned innovative developments which may not be feasible under a standard zone district but which may be permitted use of an approved development plan by assuring greater control and specificity of intended development character use operations and maintenance while at the same time allowing flexibility and diversity while the city council recognizes that planned developments may vary certain design and other requirements the planned development process may not be used to circumvent the intent and spirit of the protections afforded by this chapter the planned development district recognizes the great variety of land use intensities densities and environmental and land use interfaces which are possible the general purposes of this article are as follows 1 to accommodate extraordinary or unique development proposals that are not feasible under standard zone districts 2 to accomplish compatible development with adjacent commercial residential andor industrial land uses land use transitions and buffering techniques 3 to promote flexibility in design and permit diversification in the location of structures 4 to promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of building circulation systems land use and utilities 5 to preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape features and to minimize impacts on other natural features of the site 6 to combine and coordinate architectural styles building forms and building relationships within the planned developments 7 to promote conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan established policies and guidelines for the area and for the community  7912   10812 planned development review procedures a development plans there are two 2 distinct steps in establishing a planned development approval

aesthetic integrity of the city of wheat ridge and the neighborhoods thereof in adopting said section the city council has attempted to adopt regulations which provide for such aesthetic protection while placing the least possible restrictions or limitations upon the legitimate ability of residents to avail themselves of the current and future technology represented by satellite signalreceiving earth stations the city council has knowingly and intentionally provided for restrictions on such aspects of satellite signalreceiving earth stations as color and location and roof mounting because those aspects of regulation relate directly to aesthetic considerations which are important to all residents of the city not just those who choose to avail themselves of the technology of satellite signalreceiving earth stations and those aspects of regulations which are deemed not to interfere unreasonably with the right of a homeowner or business owner to avail himself of and to receive said technology in addition the right of an aggrieved property owner to seek a variance from the provisions of this section provides adequate protection without unreasonable or excessive cost of the rights

governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights andor velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas flood losses are also caused by uses that are inadequately floodproofed inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage c public objectives to be achieved the city council hereby finds it in the public interest and in the furtherance of the public health safety and welfare that the following objectives be fulfilled 1 to promote the public health safety and general welfare to minimize flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards and to promote wise use of the special flood hazard area by a prohibiting certain uses which are dangerous to life or property in time of flood b restricting uses which would be hazardous to the public health in time of flood c restricting uses which are so particularly susceptible to flood damage so as to alleviate hardship and reduce demands for public expenditures for relief and protection d restricting permitted special flood hazard area uses including public facilities which serve such uses to be protected against floods by providing floodproofing and general flood protection at the time of initial construction 2 to protect occupants of the special flood hazard area from a flood which is or may be caused by their own or other land use and which is or may be undertaken without full realization of the danger a regulating the manner in which structures designed for human occupancy may be constructed so as to prevent danger to human life within such structures b regulating the method of construction of water supply and sanitation systems so as to prevent disease contamination and unsanitary conditions c delineating and describing areas that could be inundated by floods so as to protect individuals from purchasing lands for purposes which are not in fact suitable d ensuring that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard e ensuring that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions 3 to protect the public from the burden of extraordinary financial expenditures for flood control and relief a regulating all uses within the special flood hazard area so as to produce a method of construction and a pattern of development which will minimize the probability of damage to property and loss of life or injury to the inhabitants of the flood hazard areas b minimizing the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public c minimizing prolonged business interruptions d minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard e helping maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future floodblight areas f participating in the national flood insurance program to assist property owners in obtaining adequate insurance coverage 4 to protect the hydraulic characteristics and storage capacity of the special flood hazard area and small watercourses including the gulches sloughs and artificial water channels used for conveying floodwaters so as to promote retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows which can reasonably be expected to occur by a regulating filling dumping dredging and alteration of channels by deepening widening or relocating so as to maintain natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics b prohibiting unnecessary encroachments c encouraging uses such as agriculture open space recreation greenbelt trails and intermittent parking d preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas e restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities f requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  1 11314 definitions unless
