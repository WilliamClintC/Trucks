flight path of the salt lake city international airport of the impacts associated with aircraft operation and to institute general safety requirements the salt lake city international airport provides a regional transportation link for the entire united states that is vital to the economic welfare of the region therefore it has been determined that an airport overlay zone should be established which recognizes the impacts present outside of the airport boundaries obstructions that affect the size available for landing take off and maneuvering of aircraft impair the utility of airports and the public investment therein therefore it is necessary in the interests of the health safety and general welfare of the public that an airport overlay zone be established to prevent hazards to the

except remodeling shall provide a navigation easement that notifies current and subsequent property owners that their property is located within the flight corridor and may be subject to impacts generated by aircraft the navigation easement grants perpetual rights to the salt lake city airport authority for the airspace above the land for the free and unrestricted passage of all aircraft to the extent that aircraft using salt lake city airport authority facilities do not exceed current federal guidelines including any amendments for airport noise 714603 height limitations no structure
