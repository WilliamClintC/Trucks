beach means the zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low water line to the place where there is marked change in material or physiographic form or to the line of permanent vegetation usually the effective limit of storm waves the term beach is alternatively termed shore breakaway building wall and frangible building wall mean a partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces but will fail under hydrostatic wave and runup forces associated with the design storm surge under such conditions the wall shall fail in a manner such that it breaks up into components that will minimize the potential for damage to life or adjacent property building support structure means any structure which supports floor wall or column loads and transmits them to the foundation the term shall include beams grade beams or joists and includes the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles columns or footings coastal building zone means all of the land in the city east of the western bank of the indian river as defined by the mean high water line column action means the potential elastic instability in piles or columns resulting in axial or lateral bending of the member due to compressive stress construction means the carrying out of any building clearing filling or excavation or the substantial improvement in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land other than coastal protective structures and beach fillnourishment when appropriate to the context the term construction refers to the act of construction or the result of construction design storm means the 100year storm event including a storm surge equivalent to the base flood elevation as determined by the federal emergency management agency dune means a mound or ridge of loose sediments usually sandsized lying landward of the beach and deposited by natural or artificial means major structure includes but is not limited to residential buildings including mobile homes commercial institutional industrial and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones other than coastal

purpose and intent a the purpose of this chapter is to more uniformly regulate the size number type and location of commercial communication towers antennas and support facilities advances in information technology and the federal telecommunications act of 1996 are anticipated to generate an increase in the number of requests to site commercial communication support facilities in the city of vero beach the city encourages advances in communication technology that better serve its residents and does not prohibit commercial telecommunication facilities however the purpose of the ordinance is to protect city character and public safety by controlling tower location height aesthetics and use of rightsofway b the intent of this chapter is to accomplish the following 1 minimize the impacts of wireless communication facilities on surrounding areas by establishing standards for location structural integrity and compatibility 2 encourage the location and collocation of wireless communication equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual aesthetic and public safety impacts effects upon the natural environment and wildlife and to reduce the need for additional antennasupporting structures 3 accommodate the growing need and demand for wireless communication services 4 encourage coordination between suppliers of wireless communication services in the city 5 respond to the policies embodied in the telecommunications act of 1996 in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless service or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless service in the city 6 establish predictable and balanced regulations governing the construction and location of wireless communications
