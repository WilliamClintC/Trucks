condition at the point of discharge during a design storm of fixed intensity the formula for quantifying runoff utilizing the rational formula is given as q  cia where q  quantity of runoff in cubic feet per second c  coefficient of runoff dimensionless i  rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a given storm event a  size of the disturbed area in acres a runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient will vary depending on the slope and surface materials for the site a weighted coefficient can be obtained for predevelopment and post development conditions by selecting values from table 1 and averaging them according to the size of contribution in the disturbed area 1810 b rainfall intensity the rainfall intensity is derived by calculating the time of concentration time of concentration is the time it takes runoff water to reach the downstream point of discharge in the disturbed area from the farthest point upstream in the disturbed area the method for calculating this time in minutes is given by figure 11 in no case will time of concentration be less than five 5 minutes once a time of concentration has been determined the rainfall intensity can be selected from the chosen storm event curve rainfall intensity curves are shown in figure 2 c area this is the disturbed area in acres it will be the same value for both the predevelopment and post development conditions as added by #998 oct 2005 18603 technical guidelines 1 drainage system the city consists of four main drainage basins that have different degrees of runoff sensitivity depending on the current or proposed land use the design storm interval for runoff in each basin is defined as follows for purposes of runoff calculations drainage basin 1 10year storm event drainage basin 2 10year storm event drainage basin 3 10year storm event drainage basin 4 25year storm event the definition of these drainage basins is shown in figure 3 the drainage system within a drainage basin is made up of major and minor components defined as follows a major drainage components drainage components with fifty 50 cubic feet per second or greater capacity are considered major and will be designed to pass a 100year storm event development is encouraged to utilize natural drainage as major components wherever possible to prevent the disturbance of existing runoff patterns b minor drainage components minor drainage components are those with a capacity of less than fifty 50 cubic feet per second these components will be designed to pass a 10year storm including an overflow design in the event of failure to be diverted to the major drainage system with no damage to property 2 design storm all storm events utilized for design are based on the national weather service records for nashville tennessee for a 24hour rain event see figure 2 the design frequency interval utilized will vary depending on the function and location of the drainage component as defined elsewhere in this ordinance 3 retentiondetention ponds the use of drainage ponds is encouraged where excessive runoffs from newly developed property threaten the 1figures are included at the end of this chapter 1811 capacity of downstream drainage structures ponds are designed to delay runoff until sufficient time has elapsed to provide the needed capacity to pass the design storm downstream utilization of the retentiondetention pond as a storm water control feature is subject to the following rules and regulations a residential commercial or industrial site developers are responsible for the overall development of site detentionretention detentionretention improvements must be completed or the developer must post a performance bond or a letter of credit approved by the lawrenceburg regional planning commission before the developer can transfer ownership b sites wit a developed increase of less than ten 10 percent not exceeding ten 10 cubic feet per second total runoff are not required to have detentiondetention ponds as a storm water control feature c sites with direct discharge to a usgs blueline stream are not required to have detentionretention ponds as a storm water control feature d detentionretention ponds will have a warranty period of one 1 year from date of completion and successful operation e detentionretention outlet structures will be designed to provide water polishing in cases where potential pollutants may be discharged f detentionretention ponds will be provided with spillway structures sized to pass the 100year storm event g all detentionretention ponds will have an outlet structure that is designed to accommodate downstream flow without increased erosion h if the drainage way downstream of the point of discharge a distance of one tenth of the longest reach of the developed property is shown to have a capacity for the increased runoff then the site is not required to have detentionretention pond as a storm water control feature i modifications to detentionretention ponds will require design calculations by a design professional to verify proper performance under this ordinance and approval by the lawrenceburg regional planning commission 4 offsite improvements existing offsite drainage system improvements rnay be utilized to accommodate increases in runoff these improvements are subject to the written approval of the affected property owner and the city 5 exemptions the following sites are exempt from the conditions of this ordinance a sites with less than one half 12 acre of disturbed area b single lot

relief all relief is subject to a recommendation by the lawrenceburg regional planning commission to the lawrenceburg board of mayor and council for approval on a casebycase basis 7 maintenance drainage ways and structures including detentionretention ponds will be contained within permanent easements for maintenance access the property owner will have the responsibility of maintaining all drainage system components contained within the site for residential sites within the corporate limits the property owner has the option of deeding drainage easements to the city after one year of successful operation transfer of ownership will relieve the property owner of all responsibilities pertaining to the drainage system including maintenance 8 drainage structures under public roads
