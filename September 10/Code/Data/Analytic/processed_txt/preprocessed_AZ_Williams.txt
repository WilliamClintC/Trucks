this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature ba variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners cthe characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bappeal board 1the floodplain board of the city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter 2the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 3in passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter  and athe danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bthe danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  cthe susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  dthe importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  ethe necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  fthe availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  gthe compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  hthe relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  ithe safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jthe expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and kthe costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges 4upon consideration of the factors of division b3 above and the purposes of this chapter the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  bsuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and cthe land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for

surrounding areas as a place to live visit and conduct business that encourages the continued development of tourism  4promote signs that are of appropriate scale and integrated with the surrounding buildings and landscape  5promote clear views of natural surroundings by minimizing visual clutter reducing competition for airspace and encouraging the construction of signs of natural materials which are compatible with the historic cultural and natural surroundings  6protect the public from hazardous conditions that can result from signs that are structurally unsafe obscure the vision of motorists create dangers to pedestrian traffic or which compete or conflict with necessary traffic signals and warning signs  7eliminate distracting lighting excessive glare and light pollution by reasonably limiting the illumination of signs and buildings to subdued adequately shielded or concealed light sources  8impose reasonable time place and manner restrictions while not interfering with
