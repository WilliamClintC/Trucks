sexually oriented business regulation provisions  802 purpose and findings 22199  2 1 purpose a pursuant to the authority granted in the second class township prohibit nuisances to promote the health welfare cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of north strabane township hereinafter township and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment amusement and recreation the township of north strabane enacts this minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens to protect the citizens from increased crime to preserve the quality of life to preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight b the board of supervisors hereinafter supervisors has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation c the supervisors do not intend by this suppress any speech or expression activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses 2 legislative findings the supervisors find that a sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration b a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a  801 administration and government  802  licensing procedure will place a hereto fore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein c removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters d requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments e the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented businesses will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses f it is desirable for the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity g the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases i the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this the limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to  am to  pm mondays closure of such businesses on sundays and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes the public health safety and welfare  802 north strabane code  803   803 definitions 22199  3 as used in this following words and phrases shall have the meaning
