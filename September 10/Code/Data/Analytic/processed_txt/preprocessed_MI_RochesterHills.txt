mutually agreeable to the city council and the developer or sponsor limits on height bulk density and area by land use a boundary strip all of the standards of the schedule of regulations which were in effect at the time of the original approval of the project for the applicable onefamily district shall be applied to a strip at least 360 feet in depth around the outer boundaries of the area proposed for a planned neighborhood development where such area abuts a onefamily district development of this strip shall be in complete conformity with the zoning requirements of the abutting onefamily district and shall be developed only with onefamily detached residential structures provided that the strip may be penetrated by park golf course or other related open space subject to the approval of the planning commission all other uses permitted in the onefamily districts shall be prohibited from this strip the city council may vary or eliminate this 360foot requirement when the parcel in question cannot be practicably developed at this depth due to topography existing or proposed abutting development or abutting heavily traveled major thoroughfares existing or proposed it may also be waived when the abutting land use does not require a buffer of singlefamily homes b density the overall maximum permitted density within any planned neighborhood development pnd shall not exceed the following density 1 in those use districts zoned r1a or r1b onefamily residential prior to approval of a plan was approved under section 14023 of the maximum density of the pnd shall not

14023 of the maximum density of the pnd shall not exceed 56 dwelling units per acre subject to subsection b3 of this section 3 the overall density of the pnd shall be averaged for the entire pnd area included within the proposed plan nonresidential use areas and subaqueous or submerged bottom land of lakes or streams except as provided in b4 shall be excluded in computing the area of the parcel and therefore the related density areas where a public or semipublic use is located or placed shall be included for density computation on the basis of 67 percent of the area a semipublic use shall be defined as a use involving a major office or headquarters of a recognized charitable organization a ymca church etc c onefamily dwellings required not less than 65 percent of the area planned for residential development must be devoted to singlefamily detached dwellings  however the board after the recommendation of the planning commission may vary this when the parcel in question cannot practically be developed on this basis d common areas on the final development plan of any one project area the common areas and open spaces shown on the plan may be used to maintain the average density as required under subsection b of this section e yard requirements except as set forth for the 360foot strip around the outer boundary of the planned neighborhood development all yards for onefamily development may be reduced from the requirements of the schedule of regulations as follows subject to the review and approval of the planning commission front yards may be reduced by ten feet at least 20 feet of combined side yards shall be provided between buildings f multiple family only areas zoned for multiplefamily residential on  shall be developed under the schedule of regulations in effect at the time of the original approval of the project with the inclusion of the open space and common areas in the computations of density any new areas rezoned to multiplefamily residential after  shall be developed under the schedule of regulations in effect at the time of development land area once used in computing density for one project shall not again be used to compute density in another where oneunit and twounit structures are proposed there shall be compliance with the following 1 a property owner desiring to develop land zoned multiplefamily residential with onefamily andor twofamily dwelling units other than as a subdivision which meets the requirements of the regulations for the r4 singlefamily residential district shall first obtain the approval of the city council after recommendation by the planning commission approval under these provisions shall allow the property owner certain latitude for innovative designs and concepts as an alternative to the normal setback requirements etc therefore special provisions for regulation of the development are necessary in order to ensure a harmonious development and the avoidance of potential problems after the project is completed 2 before tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be given a site plan shall be presented and approved which meets the requirements of pertaining to site plan review 3 before approval shall be given the property owner of the total area approved for a planned neighborhood development and the city shall agree to the number of dwelling units allowed for the total planned neighborhood development which shall include the designation of density limitations for specific areas of the development the property owner and the city shall agree to a specific reduction in density for an area zoned multiplefamily residential which is developed under these provisions for onefamily and twofamily dwelling units once an area is so developed under these provisions another area of the planned neighborhood development may not be increased in density to compensate for the allowable units not used in the areas developed under these provisions for onefamily andor twofamily dwelling units 4 no more than 56 dwelling units per gross acre on the average of the acres with lots located thereon may be allowed for any area designated in a site plan and developed under these specific provisions for onefamily andor twofamily dwelling units 5 before approval the property owner shall provide and the city council shall approve a written agreement which will be recorded and will be binding upon and run with the land that will provide for an association which will be continuous and have the authority to enforce deed restrictions andor covenants and

singlefamily units and the total number of multiplefamily units planned for the entire development article 8  flex business overlay districts chapter 1  administration intent the flex business fb overlay districts are designed to foster vital lively and sustainable development that creates an imageable neighborhood identity for the various portions of the city located in one of the fb overlay zoning districts the fb districts are adopted to implement the vision of the master land use plan these formbased zoning regulations are at a basic level similar to traditional usebased zoning techniques because they regulate the same characteristics of development both traditional usebased zoning regulations and the formbased regulations regulate four major components of development  use site design building design and management the difference between the formbased regulations and traditional usebased regulations is the emphasis and specificity of regulation placed on each of the four elements where traditional usebased zoning regulations emphasize the regulation of uses and contain much less specificity about design the formbased regulations emphasize design and permit greater flexibility in use the intent of the formbased regulations is to create proper physical form clear regulations for the design of new development or redevelopment for the purposes of this proper physical form means development that permits a mixture of land uses in close proximity  streets that serve the need of pedestrians bicyclists and motor vehicles equitably  provides places for informal social activity and recreation  and creates building frontages that define the public space of streets with proper urban form a wide range of uses within the building may be comfortably and naturally accommodated flex business overlay districts established the fb overlay districts are optional overlay districts any land that is located within the boundaries of a fb overlay district will have two zoning designations the fb overlay and the standard underlying zoning district as shown on the zoning map property in a fb overlay district may continue to be used as permitted by the standard zoning district any new development or major redevelopment in a fb overlay district may be accomplished following either the requirements of this or the regulations applicable in the underlying zoning district minor redevelopment of existing buildings and uses developed in accordance with the standards of the underlying zoning district may be permitted to redevelop according to the dimensional standards of this even if those dimensional standards may violate the dimensional standards applicable in the underlying zoning district in the case of such minor redevelopment the planning commission shall determine which regulations of this shall apply based on the size scale and location of the proposed minor redevelopment instructions a application of requirements the provisions of this are activated by shall or must when required should or encouraged when recommended and may when optional b conflict wherever there appears to be a conflict between the regulations of this other sections of the zoning as applied to a particular development the requirements specifically set forth in this shall prevail for development standards not addressed in this the other

soils minerals andor vegetation within a natural feature setback is prohibited any land located within a natural features setback is intended to be kept in a natural state reduction of setback the minimum setback may be reduced upon application by the property owner and determination by the official or body responsible for review and approval of the proposed construction activity or operation that such construction activity or operation is not likely to endanger or materially and adversely affect the natural feature incidental to the consideration of an application to reduce a natural feature setback the city may require at the applicants expense an investigation to determine the nature location and boundaries of the natural feature in determining whether to authorize a reduction of the minimum setback the official or body responsible for review and approval of the proposed construction activity or operation shall consider the following criteria a the nature environmental sensitivity and size of the natural feature b the nature necessity and economic value of the proposed construction activity or operation c the feasibility of alternatives d the probable impact of the

of ordinances are specifically authorized in the natural features setback protective barrier the city may require that a suitable protective barrier be erected and maintained along the perimeter of the natural feature setback area to prevent construction or development activity from encroaching into the natural feature setback and to maintain the natural feature setback area in a natural and undisturbed state in perpetuity after construction is completed a permanent barrier required protective barriers shall be permanent and not easily removed barriers should also be decorative and highly visible to discourage encroachments into the natural features setback area boulder walls are an example of a permanent and visible barrier b signs delineating the perimeter of the natural features setback area are easily removed and therefore are not sufficient by themselves to fulfill the intent of this section however signs are encouraged in conjunction with a permanent barrier chapter 2  steep slopes findings and purpose a findings the city council of the city of rochester hills finds that 1 the establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect public health safety and general welfare experience has demonstrated a need for effective protection of steep slopes including careful review and regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures where in the opinion of the reviewing authority no practical alternative to such disturbance exists however in all cases where the reviewing authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is not practical such disturbance should constitute the minimum disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use of the property 2 the disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural processes erosion and sedimentation often include the loss of topsoil a valuable natural resource and can result in the disturbance of habitats degradation of surface water quality degradation of wetlands alteration of drainage patterns gullying of land obstruction of drainage structures intensification of flooding both on and off the subject site failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth and danger to the natural environment manmade structures and the safety of persons 3 steep slopes including stabilizing deeproot vegetation located thereon are important environmental features that contribute significantly to the natural beauty of the city overdevelopment of or improperly managed disturbance to these steep slopes is detrimental to the environment and the overall character of nearby areas 4 regulation can allow the reasonable use of private property by encouraging flexible development design so as to avoid disturbance of steep slopes regulation can also permit limited disturbance of steep slopes that are conducted in accordance with acceptable engineering practices and will not negatively impact the integrity of the steep slope or other nearby environmental features b purpose these regulations are adopted with the intent of providing a reasonable balance between the rights of the individual property owners and the public interest in preserving the valuable functions of steep slopes the purpose of these steep slope regulations are to 1 provide qualitative and quantitative development controls in order to preserve protect and conserve steep slopes within the city of rochester hills 2 to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its vegetative features wetlands water bodies and watercourses 3 prevent flooding protect important scenic views and vistas preserve areas of wildlife habitat and provide safe building sites 4 protect property within the city by preventing erosion creep and sudden slope failure applicability steep slope areas fall into three categories a moderate steep slope is a slope equal to or greater than one vertical on five horizontal 20 percent but less than one vertical on four horizontal 25 percent and with a vertical elevation change of ten feet or greater a very steep slope is a slope equal to or greater than one vertical on four horizontal 25 percent but less than one vertical on 25 horizontal 40 percent and with a vertical elevation change of ten feet or greater a bluff slope is a slope greater than or equal to one vertical on 25 horizontal 40 percent with a vertical elevation change of 15 feet or greater the provisions of this apply to lands defined andor designated as steep slope
