chapters 7 23 and 25 articles 5 and 7 and title 6 amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and council of the town of surfside beach south carolina does ordain as follows  findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the town of surfside beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increased flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage  statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited the provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion and habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs  lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all

the former art iii pertained to similar subject matter and derived from adopted  division 1  generally short title this article shall be known and cited as the stormwater management  of the town of surfside beach att a 12914 findings of fact the town finds that inadequately or improperly designed constructed or maintained drainage facilities and the development of land without due consideration of potential problems associated with stormwater runoff may have significant adverse impact upon the quality of the waters of the community and that in the absence of adequately and properly designed constructed and maintained facilities the following situations have occurred and may occur again which have potential adverse impact on the publics health safety and welfare 1 unregulated land use changes may result in increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff contributing to local and area flooding which is potentially harmful to human health welfare and safety and creates a risk of harm to property and unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of life or property 2 development requiring the alteration of natural topography or removal of vegetation may increase the rate and volume of stormwater runoff thereby increasing soil erosion and sedimentation and degrading water quality 3 the siltation of a drainage facility resulting from increased erosion may significantly decrease the drainage facilitys capacity to transport stormwater thereby increasing the potential for more frequent and aggravated flooding 4 the piecemeal strategies practiced in the absence of stormwater management techniques most often result in increased offsite flooding erosion and property damage 5 uncontrolled surface water runoff carries pollutants including nutrients heavy metals debris oils and greases into receiving bodies thereby degrading their water quality 6 increased rates and volumes of stormwater discharged onto the beach may further increase beach erosion reducing the aesthetic value of the beach and increasing the potential for property damage to oceanfront structures 7 the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes phase ii municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 permit requires the town to implement a stormwater management program that meets the requirements of the clean water act att a 12914 objectives the objectives of this article include the following 1 protect maintain and enhance the shortterm and longterm public health safety and general welfare this objective will be achieved by a establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with both future land development and existing developed land within the town of surfside beach  b providing proper management of stormwater runoff to minimize damage to public and private property and reduce the effects of land disturbing activities on land and stream channel erosion  c protecting preserving and enhancing water quality and fish and wildlife habitat within the town of surfside beach and in downstream receiving waters  and d alleviate street and property flooding and its adverse impacts caused by urban development 2 comply with state and federal epa stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the clean water act these requirements include a control pollutants from stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharge from residential commercial and industrial developments  b prohibit illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system  c control discharges to the stormwater drainage system from spills and dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater  d control agreements contribution of pollutants from one 1 municipal system to another 3 require plans to minimize the transport of pollutants to the local stormwater drainage system by requiring approval and implementation of stormwater management and sediment control plans 4 establish procedures which minimize damage from flooding caused by development while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial 5 require construction where possible of drainage facilitiessystems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems 6 establish procedures for the planning and implementation of stormwater improvements using a basinwide or subbasin approach which considers the total stormwater basin system or major portions of the basin system beyond individual subdivisions and developments 7 to design construct and maintain stormwater management facilities to minimize mosquitorelated problems 8 to protect the water quality of the ocean and the physical characteristics of the beach area by minimizing the rates volumes and velocities of stormwater entering drainage systems discharging to the beach att a 12914 application the application of this article and the provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute in addition if site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or residents it is the designers responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary town of surfside beach officials shall be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this article att a 12914 jurisdiction of this chapter pertaining to stormwater

into the surrounding soil the surface of the system can be covered with grating andor consist of stone gabion sand or a grassed area with a surface inlet utilizing underground pipes within the trench can increase the temporary storage capacity of the system and can sometimes provide storage for flooding control a infiltration systems are suitable for use where the subsoil is sufficiently permeable to provide a reasonable rate of infiltration they are also practical where the water table is sufficiently lower than the design depth of the facility to prevent pollution of the groundwater b infiltration systems are not practical for large drainage areas generally infiltration systems should be limited to five 5 acres multiple systems can be considered c infiltration practices are generally suited for low to medium density development thirtyeight 38 percent to sixtysix 66 percent impervious cover d determine if the development conditions and drainage area are appropriate for an infiltration system application e infiltration systems are assumed to have rectangular crosssections f all systems should be designed to capture sediment prior to entering the reservoir g backfill

high infiltration rates of twentyseven hundredths 027 inches per hour or greater d depth to water table should be at least three 3 feet e determine if the development conditions and drainage area are appropriate for an infiltration system application f a swale should have a trapezoidal crosssection to spread flows across its flat bottom minimum bottom width should be two 2 feet and maximum six 6 feet in order to maintain sheet flow across the bottom and to avoid concentration of low flows g flow depth is determined by vegetation height and hydraulics h velocity should be no greater than one and onehalf 15 feet per second maximum design velocity is five 5 feet per second i the minimum slope is between threefourths 075 and one 1 percent the maximum slope depends upon what is needed to maintain the desired flow velocities to provide adequate storage generally longitudinal slope should be between one 1 to three 3 percent the slope should never exceed five 5 percent j a swale should have the capacity to convey the peak flows from a tenyear event without exceeding the maximum permissible velocities k vegetation must be maintained to design standards with a dense cover of watertolerant erosionresistant species appropriate vegetative species for use in the swale are but not limited to tall fescue reed canary grass redtop bulls tongue and others l check dam maximum
