and objectives statutory authorization municipal the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the city council of the city of marion north carolina does ordain as follows  1 71508 findings of fact 1 the floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the city of marion are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards  1 71508 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  1 71508 objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1protect human life safety and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas  and 7ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area  1 71508 secs 85825 reserved

permit natural pollutant discharge elimination system permit potw publicly owned treatment works rnc reportable noncompliance show cause meeting formal meeting requiring the siu to appear and demonstrate why the control authority should not take a proposed enforcement action against it siu significant industrial user  1 purpose this enforcement response plan outlines procedures the city of marion will use in order to identify document and respond to violations of pretreatment regulations by significant industrial users sius this plan describes how the city will investigate violations and describes the types of enforcement to be taken identifies the officials responsible for each type of response and reflects the city of marions responsibility to enforce all pretreatment requirements and standards the city of marions enforcement response plan is to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations and to ensure that all industries are given fair and equal treatment if enforcement of pretreatment standards and regulations are necessary  2 enforcement authorities available of the city of marions sewerage and waste discharge standards gives the potw the authority to take a wide variety of enforcement actions each of these actions can be viewed as having a certain degree of punitiveness the citys enforcement response plan will utilize all of the enforcement tools available to the potw in a system which outlines escalating enforcement actions dependent on the nature of the violations and the cooperativeness or recalcitrance of the violator listed below are remedies authorized by the suo and the list is presented in order of punitiveness least punitive first and most punitive last 1notice of violation section 2099a 2consent order section 2099d 3show cause orderhearing section 2099c 4administrative order section 2099d 5emergency suspensions section 2099e 6termination of permit section 2099f 7criminal penalties 1 and 2 in addition to this section 20100 of the suo authorizes the director to assess civil penalties of up to two thousand five hundred dollars $250000 per day violation civil penalties are normally used along with one of the other seven 7 activities listed above and the punitiveness of the penalty depends on the dollar amount  3 noncompliance determination a the city of marion will investigate siu compliance by 1inspections of the siu 2reviewing siu selfmonitoring data 3reviewing compliance data collected by the potw b the sewer use ordinance and guidance provided by the epa and the division of environmental management has been used by the city to identify these categories of noncompliance 1unpermitted discharges unpermitted discharges can result from several activities the siu might fail to obtain a permit prior to discharging to the wastewater treatment plant the siu might discharge to a point in the collection system which is not identified in the sius permit the siu might begin to discharge a pollutant which was previously identified as absent by the industry also the siu might continue to discharge when its permit has expired unpermitted discharges will normally be discovered during the inspection of an industry the inspector will be responsible for determining the severity of the violation during his inspection the severity will depend on whether the unpermitted discharge poses an immediate threat to the potw or the environment and whether the industry was unaware of the requirements or seeking to avoid the regulations 2permit noncompliance the four 4 areas permit noncompliance falls into are discussed below apermit limit noncompliance permit permit limit violations are fairly straightforward and the severity depends on whether the violation is considered reportable noncompliance rnc rnc is defined in north carolinas general pretreatment regulations it is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to evaluate compliance with pretreatment limitations each time data is received and at the end of each semiannual reporting period bselfmonitoring noncompliance noncompliance with monitoring occurs when the siu fails to conduct all of the selfmonitoring required by its pretreatment permit the severity of the violations depends on how much selfmonitoring was actually completed if the siu conducted less than eighty 80 percent of the sampling and analyses required in a sixmonth period the violation is considered significant or rnc each time a selfmonitoring report is received from the siu it is the responsibility of the pretreatment coordinator to compare the report to the permit requirements and evaluate compliance with monitoring requirements creporting violations reporting violations occur when the siu fails to provide information which is required by the permit within the time period stated in the permit or when the information is incomplete or false reports required by the permit can include selfmonitoring reports spill prevention plans baseline monitoring reports ninetyday compliance reports and sludge handling plans in the case of late or incomplete reports the severity of the violation depends on the length of time the report is late if a complete report is not submitted within thirty 30 days of the due date the violation is considered rnc knowingly submitting false information is always considered a significant violation it is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to track the report due dates included in the pretreatment permits and to evaluate compliance in terms of the tardiness and completeness of the submission dviolations of other permit conditions the pretreatment permits issued by the city contain about twenty 20 conditions which do not fall into the category of limits monitoring or reporting requirements for example the pretreatment permit prohibits slug loads and requires the siu to properly operate its pretreatment facility violations of these conditions would normally be discovered as part of an inspection or in conjunction with another enforcement action the pretreatment coordinator is responsible for evaluating compliance with these requirements and the severity of the violation is determined by the director  4 violations of enforcement orders violations of enforcement are actually very similar to pretreatment permit noncompliance in that they can be broken down into limits violations interim limits monitoring violations increased monitoring required by order and reporting violations in addition violations of enforcement orders would include missing milestone dates and noncompliance with final limits once the order has expired however all violations of enforcement orders with the exception of interim limits violations are considered rnc interim limit violations would not be considered significant if they did not meet the criteria listed in the pretreatment regulations of north carolina and if the siu paid the stipulated penalty assessed once the siu has been put on an enforcement order the citys initial response to violations becomes simply a matter of notifying the siu of the violation and collecting the stipulated penalty outlined in the order it is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to track compliance with the order and notify the director when penalties should be assessed once the director is informed of noncompliance with an order he will determine whether the violations are so severe as to warrant elevated enforcement for example an escalated enforcement action would be needed if its were clear that the siu could no longer meet the remaining milestone dates in the existing order  5 response to noncompliance in order to ensure that the city is taking timely and effective enforcement actions two 2 tools will be employed an enforcement response guide and an enforcement flowchart the purpose of the enforcement response guide erg is to identify initial responses and time frames for each of the types of violations discussed under noncompliance determination once the enforcement action is taken the flow chart can be used to identify the more punitive action which will be taken if the siu failed to return to compliance as a result of the previous or initial action attached to and made a part of this article by reference is the erg and the flowchart these tools will help make enforcement of violations of pretreatment regulations much easier to identify document and respond to  6 penalties the city shall charge the siu in addition to the amounts established in table i of the enforcement response guide any amounts assessed the city of marion by the federal andor state governments for any violations caused by the siu  7 zoning __________ editors note printed herein is the zoning ordinance adopted by city council
