capacity to one pipe of a larger size at the same velocity of flow the volume delivered by two 2 pipes of different sizes is proportional to the squares of their diameters  thus one fourinch pipe will deliver the same volume as four 4 twoinch pipes with the same head however the velocity is less in the smaller pipe and the volume delivered varies about as their diameter ratio to the 265 power this

submitted 5allocation of lands the vacation and abandonment of city streets alleys utility easements special purpose easements canals water bodies and other nonfee interests of the city can be accomplished in several ways the citys authority to accomplish this is derived from the home rule powers act fs   as adopted by the state legislature via as amended from time to time therefore the city ordinances control this issue there are several ways that vacation and abandonments can de delineated the area to be vacated or abandoned can be divided equally with the adjacent property owners or divided unequally with the adjacent property owners curvilinear areas usually are divided equally amongst the property owners via the adjacent property line extensions irregularshape water bodies are usually divided from property line extensions that are at right angles to the determined centerline of the water body this is normally performed by a registered land survey licensed with the state to determine the centerline of an irregular shaped water body and provide a map of survey of the determined centerline this is also known as a specific or special purpose survey the definition of a map of survey is a graphical or digital depiction of the facts of size shape identity geodetic location or legal location determined by a survey the term map of survey survey map includes the terms sketch of survey plat of survey or other similar titles map of survey or survey map may also be referred to as a map or the map the common types of vacations or abandonments are as follows aequal split typically the process of vacation or abandonment is divided equally to be allocated to each adjacent property owner this is the most equable way of elimination of city ownership of a rightofway easement of special easement figure a below depicts this concept  bunequal split there are unusual circumstances that originally created a street rightofway or a utility easement most notably this is done by different deeds or adjoining record plats that create the noted rightofway or easement when vacating or abandoning a segment of land created by such unusual input the reversion of the land should be divided along the common line that created the rightofway or easement thus the allocation to each adjacent property owner will be unequal based on the instruments that created the original rightofway or easement figure b below depicts this mechanism  coneway allocation when rightofways or easements are adjacent to a quasijudicial entity ie an interstate highway or regional roadway or a transportation corridor ie fec rr the vacation or abandonment process tends to allocate said action to the adjacent property owner on one 1 side of the vacation or abandonment task this is normally due to no requirements to allocate any excess land to a quasijudicial entity or a transportation corridor that has not previously been required figure c below depicts this action  dequal split on a curvilinear parcel generally the process of vacation or abandonment is divided equally to be allocated to each adjacent property owner this is done by extension of those adjacent property lines extended to the longitudinal centerline of the curvilinear parcel it should be noted that not all allocated parcels will be the same i size in that those properties located on the inside of curvilinear portion will be slightly larger and those properties located on the outside of the curvilinear portion figure d below depicts this action  eirregular water body or land parcel when an irregular configuration or land mass is to be vacated or abandoned difference divisional characteristics are used as a rule a dimensional meander or survey line may be used to create the longitudinal centerline of the parcel this is usually performed by a registered land survey licensed with the state this is plotted on a map of survey as defined previously to reflect all existing property lines external to the land mass to be vacated or abandoned where said property lines are connected to the external edge of the land mass or shoreline in water body cases a connection is made to the determined centerline of the land mass or lake or stream at right angles to the determined centerline in general this provides the best equitable division of the land mass or water body to the adjacent property owners refer to figure e below for this delineation  fother there are other ways to assign vacated or abandoned land mass components rightofways or easements but those noted above are the most commonly used when allocating vacations or abandonments passed 12710  am passed 61912  am passed 10615 planned industrial development pid applications amaster site plan including

applied in conjunction with the design and buffering standards of this article anatural landscapes landscape designs should preserve and enhance existing natural landscapes specimen trees and native vegetation where previous landscaping has dramatically altered natural landscapes new designs should reestablish original landscape patterns and plantings bcomposition the quality of a landscape design is dependent not only on the quantity and selection of plant materials but also on how that material is arranged landscape materials should be arranged in a manner as to provide textured appearance and contrasting color use of a variety of plant materials the threedimensional form of the landscaping should be considered so that the final design presents a coherent whole cbuffering and screening the use of natural landscape materials trees shrubs hedges is preferred over the sole use of humanmade materials such as buffer walls and fences for buffering differing land uses for providing a transition between abutting properties and for screening the view of any parking storage or service areas visible from a public street or pedestrian area dresponsive to local character landscape designs should build on the unique physical characteristics of the site and general area conserving and complementing existing natural features naturalistic design elements such as staggered plant spacing undulating berm contours and mixed proportions of plant species should be used to ensure that new landscaping blends in and contributes to the quality of the surrounding area euse of drought resistant and native plants landscape designs should utilize drought tolerant plant materials to the maximum extent feasible the use of droughttolerant plants should enrich the existing landscape character conserve water and energy and provide as colorful and varied a visual appearance as plants that require more water landscape designs should feature native andor related plant species especially in areas adjacent to existing native vegetation to take advantage of the unique natural character and diversity of the region and the adaptability of native plants to local environmental conditions where feasible the reestablishment of native habitats should be incorporated into the landscape design plant selection should be based on the plants adaptability to site conditions and existing native plant communities particularly considering appropriate hardiness zones soil type and moisture conditions light mature plant size desired effect color and texture plant species that are droughttolerant and freezetolerant are preferred fcontinuity and connection landscaping should be designed within the context of the surrounding area provided that the landscaping is also consistent with these design principles whether the design intent and surrounding landscape is naturalistic or formal plant materials and design should blend well with adjacent properties particularly where property edges meet to create a seamless and natural landscape genhancing architecture landscape designs should be compatible with and enhance the architectural character features and scale of the buildings onsite and help relate the building to the surrounding landscape major landscape elements should be designed to complement architectural elevations and rooflines texture density and form on both vertical and horizontal planes henergy conservation and sustainable design attention should be given to locating landscape elements in a manner that supports energy conservation large tree canopies should be utilized to provide daytime shading for buildings reducing energy consumed for interior air conditioning landscape designs should also consider natural drainage features and the use of pervious surfaces and areas to minimize stormwater runoff the use of pervious surfaces is preferred therefore impervious surfaces and materials within landscaped areas should be limited to borders sidewalks step stones and other similar materials gravel river rock shell and similar materials should be used minimally because they increase the need for herbicide use have no habitat value reflect rather than absorb heat and do no produce oxygen like plants finally the solar orientation of the project and its relationship to other properties should be considered as

2standards aeach building shall meet the buildto line and reduced setback areas of the respective zoning district or overlay zone whichever is applicable the location of offstreet parking areas is strongly discouraged between buildings and rightsofway however in certain instances this type of design may be impractical and strict adherence may deter incremental improvements or upgrades to individual properties which therefore perpetuates the blighted conditions of the redevelopment areas in these circumstances deviations from the buildto line and reduced setback area requirements may be allowed but only contingent the submittal of a community design appeal application that satisfactorily addresses the evaluation criteria and when such application is approved by the city commission bwithin mixeduse and nonresidential developments structures proposed along arterial roadways shall be required to occupy the entire length of the street frontage notwithstanding adjustments for
