the city 2the demand for telecommunications services has grown exponentially in recent years requiring the continual upgrading of telecommunications equipment and services to satisfy such demand 3the placement of telecommunications equipment and facilities in the public rightsofway to satisfy the demand for telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the citys responsibility to manage its public rightsofway 4the public rightsofway must be managed and controlled in a manner that enhances the health safety and general welfare of the city and its citizens 5the use and occupancy of the public rightsofway by providers of communications services must be subject to regulation which can ensure minimal inconvenience to the public coordinate users maximize

provides for procedures for adoption of an ordinance which is a regulation of general and permanent nature and enforceable as local law 7fla stat   provides that because federal and state law require

legislature that municipalities and counties treat providers of communications services in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner when imposing rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public roads or rightsofway 8the city finds that to promote the public health safety and general welfare it is necessary to i provide for

with applicable state and federal law iii manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rightsofway by all communications services providers iv minimize disruption to the public rightsofway and v require the restoration of the public rightsofway to original condition 9the citys intent is that these rules and regulations must be generally applicable to all providers of communications services and notwithstanding any other law may not require a provider of communications services to apply for or enter into an individual license franchise or other agreement with the city as a condition of placing or maintaining communications facilities in its roads or rightsofway 10it is also the citys intent to exercise the citys retained authority to regulate and manage

finds 1sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2certain workers of certain sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 253448  and currently there are 1400000 people infected with the disease nationally with 40000 people becoming infected annually 8as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state of florida with over 100000 aids cases being reported in the state of florida from 1983  2005 florida ranks third in cumulative aids cases in the united states and has the second highest aids rate in the united states 9from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the twentyeight 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10the number of cases of early less than one 1 year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 and between 2004 and 200 the national syphilis rate increased eleven and onetenths percent 111% 11the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 500000 cases being reported in 1990 and currently 350000 cases of gonorrhea are reported annually with florida reporting over 20000 cases of gonorrhea annually 12the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14sanitary conditions in some sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films which gives rise to health and aesthetic concerns 16the findings noted in divisions b1 15 above and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20requiring licensees of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexuallyoriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexuallyoriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printed material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments novelties devices or paraphernalia which depict illustrate describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas 25commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in florida where adult entertainment and sexuallyoriented commercial activities in the form of nude seminude or topless dancers entertainers performers or other individuals who for commercial gain perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas  or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers 26commercial sexuallyoriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in florida where sexuallyoriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexuallyoriented businesses operating in florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit palm bay who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28when the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials and an unhealthy and unsanitary environment possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29when the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods discourage wholesome tourism adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are incongruous with other business signage lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 32physical contact or touching within sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 33in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 34the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexuallyoriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 35requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 36prohibiting sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses 37straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 38workers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of fla stat operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage 39physical contact or touching between workers of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmittable diseases 40the practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 41sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 42requiring sexuallyoriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 43the general welfare health good order morals and safety of the citizens of the

adequate in size to transmit to the applicants property an adequate quantity of water under adequate pressure or transmit wastewater collected on the applicants property to the treatment plant or disposal site it is the citys policy to apportion the cost of the offsite facilities pro rata against the properties receiving service from such offsite facilities using the refundable advance approach since each applicant draws from the hydraulic capacity of such facilities the city will require that the applicant install such facilities and pay his propertys hydraulic share as a minimum of the cost of the offsite facilities service is rendered to the applicants property applicants are required to advance all or a portion of the offsite facilities in order to provide a physical

terminus of the facilities adequate in size to provide service as deemed appropriate by the city the applicant shall always be responsible for his hydraulic share of the cost of offsite facilities however this policy recognizes the instances in which an applicant will be required to advance the hydraulic share applicable to other undeveloped property in order that offsite facilities may be constructed to serve the subject property all amounts expended by the applicant over and above the hydraulic share for offsite facilities shall be rebated to the applicant in accordance with the terms and conditions of a rebate agreement which the city will execute the rebate agreement shall provide for a plan of rebate based upon the connection of other properties to the extent of their hydraulic share which properties will be served by the offsite facilities installed by the applicant notwithstanding the provisions of this section the city will limit the life of such rebate agreement to a term of not more than six 6 years after which time any portion of the rebates not made by the terms and conditions of the rebate agreement will have lapsed and thereafter such rebate agreement will be canceled in no event shall the rebate cover an amount greater than the difference between the capitalized cost of such offsite facilities and the applicants own hydraulic shares of such facilities the city shall not include any interest upon the rebates fmain line extension charges in order to recover those costs associated with the contributed capital portion of the water or reclaimed water

director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 4a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following provisions of this subsection acategorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this subsection any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subparagraph b below are met bcriteria 1either athe applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or bthe industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2credit for generic pollutants such as bod tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this subsection 4credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the utilities director or said representative the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subparagraph a below ato be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control

information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment

treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 5a3 of this subsection upon notification of a revised production rate the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph 5a1 of this subsection so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit cwhen developing equivalent mass limits the utilities director 1will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the iu by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the ius actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to the iu must also be in compliance with the prohibition of bypass 6the utilities director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts
