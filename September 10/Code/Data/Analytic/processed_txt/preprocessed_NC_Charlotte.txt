regulation or this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the floodplain regulations of charlotte north carolina  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of charlotte and charlottes land use jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life increased health and safety hazards destruction of property and disruption of commerce and governmental services inundation from flood waters results in public expenditures for flood protection flood disaster relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  objectives a the regulations of the special flood hazard areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating flood waters and to permit and encourage the retention of openland uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the city as provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and amended from time to time b the specific intent in establishing special flood hazard areas composed of floodways and flood fringe areas includes the following 1 to control uses such as fill dumping storage of materials structures buildings and any other works which acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage  2 to protect human life and health  3 to minimize the expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  4 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  5 to permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 to protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of storm water in periods of heavy precipitations  8 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  9 to meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased  10 to inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a special flood hazard area as well as the associated flood risks and development restrictions  11 to minimize future flood losses by depicting community flood fringe areas on the flood insurance rate maps  and 12 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas c this chapter is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved the regulations hereinafter set forth shall apply to all property located within the special flood hazard area as shown on the flood insurance rate maps firm including fema andor locally approved revisions to data shown on the firms it is the intent that these regulations combine with and coordinate with the zoning ordinance regulations for the zoning district in which such property is located

development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reduce groundwater recharge  2 these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and 3 these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt the minimum

street network and blocks a street network a network of interconnected streets providing both external and internal connectivity is required for all types of new development this network can be constructed with either public streets or private streets as allowed under section 2025 the following uses are exempt from the street network requirements 1 schools 2 parks 3 places of worship 4 cemeteries b external connectivity 1 existing street stubs a extend any existing adjacent street stubs into the development on its proper projection b extend any existing adjacent paper street stub into the development where the city commits to construct the paper portion of the street no later than the time of permit approval c complete any existing adjacent half street located along any property line 2 additional new local streets shall be required as follows a measure the length of each property boundary and divide by the appropriate preferred block length spacing from table 1 preferred street spacing to determine the overall number of blocks required along that boundary round down to the nearest whole number where a fractional number results this is the required number of block faces along that boundary where the result is less than two but the boundary exceeds the maximum block length table 2 maximum street spacing one street is required where an oddshaped parcel has a series of boundary segments shorter than the preferred block length but separate blocks would be required if the site is measured across as opposed to along the boundary segments then a local street shall be required where the extension of nonlocal and adjacent local streets creates a street network that meets the required number of blocks no additional new streets are required if the distance from the nearest adjacent street to the parcel boundary exceeds the maximum block length then a street may be required table 1 preferred street spacing location 1 land use block length along property

any required stub streets or half streets when the property abuts a local street begin by aligning where possible with streets or driveways across the local street to create fourway intersections the average street spacing measured from centerline to centerline for an entire site shall not exceed the maximum spacing shown in the table 2 maximum street spacing no individual block face shall exceed 1000 feet exceptions as noted in subsection 2023d are allowed and will be included in the block averaging calculation based on its length or 1000 feet whichever is smaller the following streets shall

for creating blocks b new street stubs are not required to existing singlefamily developments with the following two exceptions 1 a street stub may be required to an abutting singlefamily lot that may be further subdivided based on the size and shape of the singlefamily lot making a stub street extension feasible new street stubs shall be public and connect to the existing public street system deed restrictions on the singlefamily lots may be considered in determining whether a lot is likely to be redeveloped and therefore whether a street stub should be provided 2 a paper street may be required to singlefamily lots located adjacent to thoroughfares 4 ingress and egress a all new development should provide for more than one access for ingress and egress at the time of development if feasible b new streets and driveways should align with existing streets across intersections to create fourway intersections c internal connectivity once the external streets are created connect them and ensure no block lengths exceed 1000 feet and the average of the block lengths for the entire site does not exceed the maximum block spacing shown in table 2 maximum street spacing streets eligible for inclusion in the average block length calculation are described in subsection 2023b2b d the city staff may modify the maximum local street spacing eliminate the need for a stub or paper street where 1 a physical impedance to a connection exists such as a freeway railroad line rapid transit line or gas pipeline 2 a natural impedance exists such as areas of steep slopes wetlands floodplain creeks or streams 3 an industrial use is located adjacent to a proposed residential property allowing future traffic to the nonresidential use to traverse the residential property to reach a nonlocal street 4 the shape of the property does not allow the requirements to be met 5 there are rightofway sight distance or access constraints to providing the recommended spacing 6 accessibility to the subject property or an adjacent property requires modification of the requirements 7 special manufacturing distribution warehousing industrial or security functions do not allow the street spacing requirements to be met 8 it is advantageous to the street network to align a new street with an existing street major driveway or traffic signal and therefore not creating smaller than desirable block faces e block widths block widths must be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots except where single tiers of lots will facilitate nonresidential development the separation of nonresidential and residential developments or the separation of residential development from thoroughfares f street offsets where there is an offset in the alignment of a street across an intersection the offset of the centerlines may not be less than 125 feet staff may reduce this requirement based on analysis of safety and operational conditions g culdesac culdesacs and other permanently deadend streets are allowed only where no feasible alternative has been documented no culsdesac are permitted in transit station areas culsdesac shall not be longer than the preferred street spacing in table 1 preferred street spacing flag lots along the turnaround portion of the culdesac shall not be used as a way to minimize the length of the culdesac where a vehicular connection is impractical and limited additional connections exist or when environmental conditions make a vehicular connection impractical a pedestrian and bicycle connection culdesac may be required h half streets new half streets are allowed only where the dual objectives of achieving a network of streets and ensuring the burden of creating streets is reasonably shared among property owners are achieved this determination shall be made by city staff based on the configuration of parcel boundaries and the anticipated impact of future extension and completion of the half street on the viability of the adjacent parcels no new half streets are allowed for singlefamily residential development where a half street partially improved exists adjacent development shall complete the street a half street must be constructed to a minimum of onehalf the width of the appropriate local street where more than onehalf of the width is constructed sufficient rightofway must be dedicated to contain the constructed portion of the street i traffic calming wherever a street exceeds the maximum block length the following conditions shall apply 1 for residential wide or officecommercial wide provide at least one pair of midblock curb extensions as described in the charlotte land development standards manual or another approved slow point 2 for all other street types the developer must consult with city staff about the possible use of other traffic calming devices as available in the charlotte land development standards manual or as approved by the city engineer j reserved k parking pedestrian green zone design while a common design for parking pedestrian and green zones on both sides of a street is preferred there may be instances where opposite sides of a street contain significantly different land uses where such instances are located parallel to a thoroughfare city staff may approve the design of each side of the roadway separately with regard to the parking pedestrian and green zones streets that extend perpendicular to a thoroughfare shall be designed for the most intense adjacent land use l collector street designation if a street is designated on the adopted collector street map dated  or meets at least two of the criteria the street will be designated as a collector street and must be built to the appropriate standard 1 the street intersects directly with a thoroughfare and provides access to an area with an overall density of one dwelling unit per acre or provides access to more than 125 dwelling units 2 the street by its general configuration in relationship to the existing development of the area in effect serves a collector function 3 the street serves as a primary access to a significant nonresidential institutional or recreational land use as well as access to a residential area  12202010   1 12152014 alternative compliance for street design a purpose and intent it is the purpose of this section to provide for the consideration of alternative street designs which differ from the conventional design standards outlined in sections 2022 and 2023 of this article but which are based upon sound engineering transportation and urban design practice alternative street design means alternative designs for physical improvements such as street crosssections street network and street block design b authority the development review board will have the authority to hear and decide applications for alternative compliance c initiation an application for alternative compliance may be initiated only by the owner of the subject property an agent authorized in writing to act on the owners behalf or a person having written contractual interest in the affected property 1 an applicant requesting alternative compliance shall schedule a preapplication conference with staff to discuss the procedures standards and regulations 2 an application in a form prescribed by the planning director must be filed with the planning department accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee as established by city council the application shall include an explanation of why the development proposal is not allowed by the ordinance standards d determination of completeness 1 within ten days of receiving an application for alternative compliance the planning director will determine whether the application is complete if the planning director determines that the application is not complete he or she will notify the applicant or specifying the applications deficiencies the planning director will take no further action on the application until the deficiencies are remedied if the planning director fails to notify the applicant the application will be deemed complete if the application is deemed complete the planning director will schedule the application for consideration at a hearing before the development review board within 30 days 2 a determination of completeness will not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these regulations but will only allow review of the application to proceed under this section in the event that the application is automatically deemed complete due to the failure of the planning director to notify the applicant of any deficiencies in the application the deficiency of information may result in rejection of the application by the development review board e staff review 1 after receipt of a complete application for alternative compliance the planning director will review the application and send a written recommendation to the development review board setting forth whether the application for alternative compliance should be granted or denied and the reasons for such recommendation in making such recommendation the planning director may consult with other city and county agencies and may allow them to review the application for alternative compliance the recommendation of the planning director will be submitted to the development review board and mailed to the applicant at least five days prior to the scheduled public hearing f notice and hearing 1 the development review board will hold hearings on any application for alternative compliance which comes before it in accordance with rules adopted by it for such purpose 2 the planning staff will mail written notice of the time place and subject of the hearing to the person or persons filing the application to the owners of the subject property and to the owners of property which adjoins or is directly across a street or alley from the subject property at least 15 days prior to the hearing g action by the development review board the development review board will grant or deny the application for alternative compliance the board must state the reasons used to reach its decision h approval criteria before granting approval of an application for alternative compliance the development review board must determine that 1 while the proposed alternative design does not strictly meet all of the standards of the urban street design guidelines it nevertheless satisfies their intent and is not an inferior improvement design 2 the proposed alternative design will have the same or higher level of service or adequacy as the standard required improvements it is not the intent of the alternative compliance procedure to allow an inferior improvement design to the standards required by this chapter for the purpose of reducing cost 3 the departure from the standard is the minimum necessary given the specific circumstances of the request 4 the proposed alternative design will not materially endanger the public health or safety if constructed where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved i rehearing the development review board may refuse to hear an application for alternative compliance which is substantially similar to an application that has been previously denied j appeal from development review board any appeal of a decision rendered by the development review board under this section must be to the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari any petition for review by the superior court must be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the development review board is filed in the office of the planning director or after a written copy thereof is mailed to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the planning director at the time of the hearing whichever is later k effect of grant of application for alternative compliance after the approval of a application for alternative compliance the applicant will be required to follow the procedures for preliminary and final plat approval in order to proceed with development of the subject property all decisions made by administrative officers under those procedures will comply with the alternative compliance to the regulations granted to the applicant by the development review board or court  12202010 editors note

be allowed in place of public streets with approval by staff 2 where lots or building sites that are part of a multifamily development exceed the maximum street spacing in subsection 2023b2b at least one street extending development in both directions shall be a public street the location of the required public street shall be determined based on the location with the greatest value for connectivity to the existing roadway network where no extension of a multifamily public street into adjacent sites is possible the applicant may construct such a street as a private street 3 for certain planned multifamily dwellings need not front on a street provided that all portions of the dwelling unit proposed for such lots are located within 400 feet of a public street or private street

determination of the crest elevation of the flood expected to be equaled or exceeded on the average of one time in one hundred years the year flood in accordance with generally accepted engineering practice which is to be submitted with the seal and signature of a professional engineer to the city or county engineer this determination must reflect the actual conditions imposed by the completed subdivision and must give due consideration to the effects of urbanization and obstructions upon request and subject to available staff and any applicable fees the city engineer will make the necessary determination of the 100year flood crest if the necessary existing and proposed conditions are provided by the subdivider no proposed building lot that is wholly or partly subject to flooding shall be approved unless there is established on the final plat a line representing an actual contour as determined by field survey at an elevation one foot above the 100year flood crest such line shall be known and identified on the final plat as the stormwater elevation line in addition a stormwater protection elevation for each lot subject to flooding shall be noted on the lot plan as determined by the county engineer based on the stormwater elevation line or for lots upstream of street crossings the low elevation of the street plus one foot whichever is greater all habitable

the stormwater protection elevation where only a portion of a proposed lot is subject to flooding as defined herein such lot may be approved only if there will be available for building a usable lot area of not less than 1200 square feet the usable lot area shall be determined by deducting from the total lot area the area of all yards and setbacks required by the applicable zoning district regulations and any remaining area of the lot lying below the stormwater elevation line during the construction of a subdivision the developer shall maintain the streambed of each stream creek or backwash channel contiguous to the subdivision in an unobstructed state and shall remove from the channel and banks of the stream all debris logs timber junk and other accumulations of a nature that would in time of flood clog or dam the passage of waters in their downstream course installation of appropriately sized stormwater drains culverts bridges or erosion control devices will not be construed as obstructions in the stream in areas of the county that are covered by the provisions of the floodway regulations the floodway regulations will supersede the provisions of this chapter regarding land within the regulatory floodplain g water access lots the water access lots must equal at least ten percent of the area exclusive of streets of all the interior property which lies within 450 feet of the waters edge however where the ten percent would equal less than 20000 square feet the subdivider will not be required to provide any water access lots all water access lots

7202009 part 2  conditional zoning districts purpose conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules regulations and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property the following zoning district categories are conditional zoning districts 1 parallel conditional zoning districts a parallel conditional zoning district is a conditional zoning district in which the potential permitted use or uses are except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district of the same character or type as the use or uses permitted in a general district having a parallel designation or name 2 conditional zoning districts identified in mixed use districts manufactured housing development commercial center district neighborhood services district and hazardous waste district and research 3 district 3 mixed use development district optional uptown mixed use district optional and transit oriented development optional described in chapter 9 parts 85 9 and 12 respectively and re3 optional described in chapter 11 part 7 4 pedestrian overlay district optional and transit supportive optional described in chapter 10 parts 8 and 9 respectively a conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards there are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could if properly planned be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations the adopted generalized land plan and adopted district and area plans the review process established in this part provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district subject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties a conditional zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal except when that proposal is consistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate that

areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities in order to foster the urban characteristics of these areas development here should promote an environment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which encourages pedestrian activities needs and movement while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of urban land as such this requires special zoning classifications in order to implement the goals and objectives of these vital areas of the community further it is necessary and desirable to promote the residential nature of these areas classifications which are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and redevelopment such residential development properly located and developed can enhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of urban areas therefore the purpose of this section is to establish the urban residential districts 2 urban residential districts are intended for use in special areas of the community and thus may be considered for limited application generally special plans or policy guides will be used to determine applicability the official zoning map of the city of charlotte will designate urban residential district boundaries 3 these districts are designed to provide standards and incentives which will promote the development or redevelopment of urban areas that contain a mix of land uses with a predominantly residential character emphasis is given to provisions which will provide opportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development objectives of these areas accordingly the development objectives are a to maximize residential development potentials in urban areas  b to establish a predominantly residential character with residential neighborhoods  c to provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas  d to protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses  e to maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas  f to protect and enhance existing singlefamily residential areas from uses which by their scale and characteristics may be inappropriate  g to provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urban land  and h to reward development projects density bonus system for including specific development features which significantly further the overall goals for these areas and which enhance the urban residential environment urban residential districts  established in order to provide densities and other development standards which are compatible with urban characteristics the following zoning classifications are established 1 urban residential1 district ur1 the intent of this district is to protect and enhance designated singlefamily areas and to encourage appropriate infill development within these areas 2 urban residential2 district ur2 the intent of this district is to promote maximum opportunities for moderate density residential development this district functions as both a transition between lower and higher density and as the predominant residential district throughout much of the fringe of the uptown area 3 urban residential3 district ur3 the intent of this district is to provide for high density residential development this district is located nearer the employment core and in areas identified for their special adaptability and appropriateness for this type of housing 4 urban residentialcommercial district urc the intent of the urc district is to promote a diversity of residential retail office recreational and cultural uses in a mixed use higher density pattern this district is restricted in location to the periphery of an employment core or to areas designated as community or neighborhood centers where a high level of commercial or other services are desired urban residential districts  uses permitted by right 1 ur1 uses permitted by right within the ur1

adopted   1820 adopted   111 adopted   8 adopted   h6 adopted    adopted    adopted    adopted  and  adopted  purpose the purpose of the pedestrian overlay district ped is to reestablish an urban fabric by promoting a mixture of uses in a pedestrianoriented setting of moderate intensity and to support economic development along business corridors the district encourages the reuse of existing structures particularly those that contribute to the unique character or history of the area the standards also encourage high quality design mixed use development the use of public transit and development which complements adjacent neighborhoods  7182011 applicability the ped will be applied to selected corridors as an overlay to existing zoning districts but will not be applicable to the mixed use development district mudd uptown mixed use district umud and the neighborhood services district ns if the regulations and standards of this pedestrian overlay district conflict with those of the underlying district those of this overlay district shall apply with one exception if the regulations and standards of this pedestrian overlay district conflict with those of an historic overlay district then historic overlay district regulations and standards for exterior features as described in section  shall take precedence over the ped regulations and standards a ped is not established until a rezoning petition is approved designating the boundaries for the particular corridor and a streetscape plan is approved by the city council the designated ped shall be shown on the official zoning maps the development and urban design standards for a ped are stated in sections  and  respectively  7182011 administrative approval to offer some degree of flexibility the planning director or designee has the authority to administratively alter any of the development and urban design standards by five 5 percent in this overlay district if administrative approval is for parking the planning director or designee will only grant this approval after consulting with cdot on matters that do not involve quantitative measurements the planning director or designee may also make minor alterations if it is determined that such changes would be an innovative design approach to development andor would be in keeping with the general intent of the ped administrative approvals shall be considered

pedestrian overlay district ped establishes minimum standards for development however circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee therefore this section establishes an alternative process by which the city council may evaluate and approve development which does not meet the minimum standards of the ped the pedestrian overlay district optional or pedo is established to provide a mechanism to review and address new development concepts innovative designs special problems publicprivate ventures and other unique proposals or circumstances which cannot be accommodated by the standards of the ped it also serves as a mechanism for altering or modifying of these minimum standards as they relate to a specific development the ped standards form the basic framework as guidelines that will be used to evaluate a pedo proposal but any of the standards in the ped may be modified in the approval of the pedo application  7182011 pedestrian overlay district optional  application petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a pedo should be submitted to the charlottemecklenburg planning department a pedo classification will be considered only upon

their natural functions stream systems are comprised of the stream and their drainage basins streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and groundwater storing floodwater and supporting aquatic and other life vegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin serve as a buffer to protect the stream systems ability to fulfill its natural functions primary natural functions of the buffer include  protect water quality by filtering pollutants   provide storage for floodwaters   allow channels to meander naturally  and  provide suitable habitats for wildlife  11151999 definitions for the purposes of the following words and phrases shall be defined as specified below 1 best management practices bmps a structural or nonstructural managementbased practice used singularly or in combination to reduce nonpoint source input to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals nonstructural bmps nonengineered methods to control the amount of nonpoint source pollution these may include landuse controls and vegetated buffers structural bmps engineered structures that are designed to reduce the delivery of pollutants from their source or to divert contaminants away from the water supply these may include wet detention ponds detention basins grass swales and ditches and infiltration devices 2 buffer a natural or vegetated area stormwater runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants 3 buffer zones the stream buffer is comprised of three 3 zones as shown below 4 buffer widths viewed aerially the stream buffer width is measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water landward from the top

drainage areas of > six hundred forty 640 acres 1 the fema fringe and flum floodway encroachment lines will be used for floodplain and buffer calculations 2 if the floodplain is less than one hundred 100 feet side the total width of the buffer on that side of the stream will be one hundred 100 feet except as provided in footnote 4 below 3 the landownerdeveloper has discretion to designate the buffer zone beyond the 100foot minimum the additional buffer area beyond one hundred 100 feet must be contiguous with at least a portion of the required 100foot buffer and be configured in such a manner as to benefit water quality 4 so long as the total buffer width is maintained the buffer may vary in width on either side of the stream based on individual stream side topography provided that the owners control both sides of the stream and the stream side zone is maintained on both sides of the stream 5 buffer requirements do not apply to the main channel of the catawba river including lake norman mountain island lake and lake wylie 2 buffer description buffer function vegetation and use vary according to the different buffer zones as described in the following table characteristics stream side zone managed use zone upland zone function protect the integrity of the ecosystems provide distance between upland development and the stream side zone prevent encroachment and filter runoff vegetative targets 1 undisturbed no cutting or clearing allowedif existing tree density is inadequate reforestation is encouraged limited clearing existing tree density must be retained to a minimum of 8 healthy trees of a minimum 6 inch caliper per 1000 square feet  if existing tree density is inadequate reforestation is encouraged grass or other herbaceous ground cover allowedforest is encouraged uses 2 very restricted permitted uses limited to flood control structures and bank stabilization as well as installation of utilities and road crossings with stabilization of disturbed areas as specified in section  restricted permitted uses limited to all uses allowed in the stream side zone as well as storm water best management practices bmps bike paths and greenway trails not to

noncommercial and not to exceed 150 square feet footnotes 1 revegetation of disturbed buffers is required as specified in the charlotte land development standards manual when such disturbances result in the failure of the buffer system to comply with the vegetative targets specified above the manual also contains recommended tree densities for each zone for voluntary reforestation efforts 2 fill material can not be brought into the buffer grading is allowed only in the upland zone commercial buildings or occupied structures are not allowed in the buffer permitted uses within the buffer zones should be coordinated to ensure minimal disturbance of the buffer system for example if it is necessary to install utilities within the buffer every attempt should be made to build greenway trails so they follow the cleared areas instead of additional clearing 3 diffuse flow requirement diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the buffer by dispersing concentrated flow and reestablishing vegetation techniques for providing diffuse flow are specified in the charlotte land development standards manual a concentrated runoff from ditches or other manmade conveyances shall be converted to

addition to what is allowed in section 4a provided this is not below the minimum requirement for the next lower zoning classification 3 relax lot setback requirements for all lots within a development requiring a swim buffer setback requirements as specified in section 4 are reduced as follows a front setbacks can be reduced to a minimum of fifteen 15 feet as measured from the rightofway line for all lots along local and collector streets however front loaded garages must maintain a minimum setback of twenty 20 feet measured from the back of sidewalk or back of rightofway whichever is greater subsection 3 b rear yards can be located one hundred 100 percent within a swim buffer rear yards can be reduced to thirty 30 feet on all internal lots rear yards forming the outer boundary of a

minimums for the development if dedicated 5 density bonus in addition to the provisions 1 above a singlefamily development projects may be granted a density bonus provided the entire required swim buffer area or the entire swim buffer area plus any additional buffer area is dedicated as common open space such dedication must be to a homeowners association or a public or private agency that agrees to accept ownership and maintenance responsibilities for the space the density bonus is calculated as follows the entire dedicated buffer area in acres multiplied by the maximum residential density number of the underlying zoning district b singlefamily projects that meet the above density bonus need not meet the minimum lot width requirements set out in subsection 1 provided that each lot meets the minimum lot width requirements set forth in table 5  11151999   12202010   10172011   1 10202014 mitigation 1 purpose the purpose of this section is to set forth the basis on which
