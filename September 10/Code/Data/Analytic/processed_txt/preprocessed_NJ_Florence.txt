this amended 462016 by  a the township council of the township of florence hereby finds that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guidance for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents b the township council further finds that the offensive activities of the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles c the township council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in florence is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community in the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles that sense of community is reflected by the curfew hours declared by this chapter which take into consideration  65a6 curfew  661   662 definitions  word usage the following terms used in this chapter are defined as follows guardian  a person other than a parent to whom legal custody of the juvenile has been given by court order or who is acting in the place of the parent or is responsible for the care and welfare of the juvenile juvenile  an individual who is under the age of 18 years also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of juveniles with potential risk incident to immaturity d in enacting this chapter the township council adopts the findings of the legislature expressed in pl 199 has taken note of the peculiar vulnerability of children both as victims of crime and as perpetrators of offenses because of peer pressure this chapter is intended not only to prevent children from causing harm but also is intended to protect children themselves from being harmed as victims of nocturnal crime e florence is basically a family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years the township council has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases and that there is a need for a nocturnal curfew for juveniles in florence and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in their care and custody f it is not the intent of this chapter to supplant parental supervision the township council recognizes the right of parents to direct their childrens upbringing and family autonomy against unreasonable interference the township council is also aware that in cases in which harm to the physical or mental health of a child or to the public safety peace order or welfare is threatened the legitimate interests of the community as a whole may override the parents qualified right to control the upbringing of their children g the township council also recognizes that juveniles are protected with certain constitutional rights and guaranties that are enjoyed by all citizens of this community it is not the intention of this chapter to deprive juveniles of the ability to exercise valid rights secured to them under the constitution of the united states or the state of new jersey the function of this chapter is instead to protect juveniles and to balance the right of all citizens of the township of florence so that all may enjoy the rights and privileges of citizens as guarantied to them by the constitution and the laws of this country and this state 40editors note see njsa 252  661 florence code  662  public place  any place to which the
