adopted nov 7 2005 cross reference motor vehicles and traffic ch 5 division 1  introduction project background street addresses are the location identifiers most widely used by state and local government and the public street addresses are critical information for administrative emergency response research marketing mapping gis routing and navigation and many other purposes because they have evolved over many decades under the control of thousands of local jurisdictions in many different record and database formats and to serve many purposes different address formats and types pose a number of complex geoprocessing and modeling issues as a consequence government agencies struggle with these issues as they seek to integrate large missioncritical files into master address repositories the lack of a unified system for address assignment and maintenance limited the practical usage of government address records and was often the source of serious errors and omissions these errors resulted in increased operating costs error recovery costs and in the case of emergency services could have affected response times resulting in lifedeath consequences during the past few years some governing agencies within the region have migrated their mapping systems to computerbased geographic information systems gis the gis mapping systems are being served via desktop intranet internet and mobile vehicle system applications and are beginning to replace total reliance upon hard copy maps this has a major impact upon government addressing systems as maps are heavily used in the assignment storage and access of site addresses the progression to gis mapping offers the advantages of rapid access more efficient update procedures geointegration with other relevant computerbased information and more comprehensive data sharing between agencies however almost all such computerbased mapping applications and software programs rely upon the site address as the key locational identifier when the database supporting that key is incomplete or inaccurate then the applications are limited in their usefulness and in some cases can incur serious problems for their users a comprehensive and accurate addressing system can tremendously enhance many aspects of village and county government operations if integrated with a wellplanned computer mapping system the added benefits of georeferencing and spatial analyses may be realized  accurate and complete mailingnotification lists  identification of all properties with a particular political boundary tax unit

enhance the effectiveness of address matching procedures used between government agencies this is a process whereby two 2 or more address lists or databases are compared for matches based upon the address fields this process is practiced extensively at this time due to the multitude of address database formats existing throughout the village and county agencies resolving the mismatches is typically a tedious and timeconsuming process and generally does not result in a one hundred 100 percent match iiexh a 12606 project purpose a related address project has been completed to build and

i 11209    iv 1719  iv 2419 soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance findings and purpose a findings the board of trustees of the village hereby finds that 1 excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  2 the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  3 soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washedout fills and embankments  4 sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  5 sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and 6 sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety b purpose the board of trustees therefore declares that the purpose of this ordinance is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village it is the intention of this ordinance that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited as closely as practicable to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state the ordinance is applied to all development as defined in section 7181 in the village definitions for the purposes of this ordinance certain terms used herein are defined as

support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for line if saturated soil conditions general principles it is the objective of this ordinance to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities including clearing grading stripping excavating and filling of land in the village measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10year frequency of less the erosion and sedimentation control practices discussed in the illinois urban manual and the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under section 4000 of this ordinance 1 development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2 natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossings of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures 3 special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation 4 the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 5 sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development 6 the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved 7 in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 8 provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will no create additional erosion onsite or downstream 9 permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development 10 those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development 11 all waste generated as a result of site development activity should be property disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water 12 all construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways site development permit a permit required except as otherwise provided in this ordinance no persons shall commence or perform any

districts general the residential districts r districts are primarily for residential land uses and for other selected uses that are deemed compatible with residential environments the various residential districts are intended to maintain and promote a variety of housing types within the village purposes of the r districts 1 re residential district this district is intended to provide areas for relatively large singlefamily detached homes on lot sizes of approximately one acre because of the intended estate character of the housing nonresidential and nonrecreational land uses are not permitted as of right in this district this zoning district corresponds to the countryside residential land use category in the villages comprehensive plan residential density is intended to be approximately 01 dwelling units per acre 2 r1 low density singlefamily residential district this district is intended to provide areas for low density singlefamily detached housing on lot sizes with a minimum of twelve thousand 12000 square feet compatible government religious educational and recreational uses may be permitted within the district this zoning district corresponds approximately to the low density residential land use category in the villages comprehensive plan residential density is intended to be a maximum of 21 dwelling units per acre if a part of a pd 3 r1 overlay district this overlay district is established to address the unique issues within the residential areas of the villages historic core area this area is illustrated on map x1 on  4 r2 singlefamily and twofamily residential district this district is intended to provide areas for a mix of singlefamily detached housing and twofamily attached housing on lot sizes with a minimum of twelve thousand 12000 square feet a limit of two 2 dwelling units per lot shall be maintained compatible government religious education and recreational land uses may be permitted within the district this zoning district corresponds approximately to the medium density residential land use category in the villages comprehensive plan residential density is intended to be a maximum of 315 dwelling units per acre as a part of a pd 5 r3 townhouse residential district this district is intended to provide areas for a variety of housing types at medium densities compatible government religious education and recreational uses may be permitted within the district this zoning district corresponds to the density but not necessarily location of the village residential land use category in the villages comprehensive plan residential density is intended to be a maximum of six 6 dwelling unit per acre if a part of a pd 6 r4 multiplefamily residential district this district is intended to provide areas for all forms of attached multifamily housing including duplexes townhouses condominiums and apartments this zoning district corresponds to the multiple family residential land use category in the villages comprehensive plan residential density is much higher than in the other districts and is intended to be a maximum of fifteen 15 dwelling unit per acre within a planned development the maximum height of a building is limited to fortyeight 48 feet 7 cv conservation district this district with a residential density of approximately 13 dwelling units per acre is intended to foster the creation of clustered residential areas that preserve natural and cultural resources the goal of this district is to retain the rural character of the site by minimizing the destruction of existing vegetation maintaining environmental corridors creating common open space conserving the natural topography and designing around thereby preserving sites of significant historic archaeological or architectural value see section 956 for specific standards and additional goals of the cv district 8 tn traditional neighborhood district this district is intended to regulate new development with more traditional forms of neighborhood layout it allows various housing types singlefamily duplex and townhouse residential density is intended to be approximately 56 dwelling units per acre although it is similar to the r3 district it differs from the r3 in allowing limited commercial uses permitting alleys and smaller lot dimensions and it has unique site design standards one of the overall goals of the tn district is to stimulate nonmotorized travel modes such as walking and biking see section 955 for specific standards for the tn district this district is not appropriate within the village core area designated as the r1 overlay district 9 hd historic district this district is intended to identify the designated historic districts as approved by the village board there may be more than one designated district but each district will have its own regulations to maintain its individual character as described in section 957 permitted and special uses in the r districts uses are allowed in the r districts in accordance with section 913 and table ii1 general standards for the r districts specific minimum and maximum standards for lots and buildings in the r districts include 1 table

five 5 foot setback subject to maintaining a minimum of five 5 feet of green space between adjacent driveways v 2507  ii 1509 tn district standards 1 intent the traditional neighborhood district is intended to regulate new development consistent with historical building patterns featuring smaller lots alleys and gridlike street patterns such development would generally be appropriate in areas planned for village residential use on the comprehensive plan this zoning category is not appropriate in the existing downtown area 2 permitted and special uses one of the goals of the tn district is to promote the creation of compact neighborhoods where daily destinationssuch as a school or grocery storecan be reached with ease on foot therefore the tn district permits a limited range of commercial activities that citizens normally frequent on a daily or weekly basis such commercial activities are typically situated on corner locations 3 design standards the tn district has unique design standards these standards are in addition to any standards or requirements found elsewhere in this ordinance or in other applicable ordinances in case of any conflict or discrepancy between a standard found in this section of the ordinance and standards found elsewhere in this ordinance or found in the village subdivision the standard found in this section shall have precedence table v1
