apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot 1 at any point within

reduction provisions of this section 7142  7143 variance procedure 71431 nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section 7143 are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the governing body to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  71432 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of sections 7141 and 7142 of this article have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in section 7139 of this article upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this article for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the governing body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the governing body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that  sterling codifiers inc  157636 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the tulare recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  71433 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the governing body shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this article and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see definition of public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of subsection 71432a of this article and the purposes of this article the

fortune telling 1 purposes and findings a the practice of fortune telling as defined in this subsection has historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners using the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients b it is the purpose of this subsection to regulate the practice of fortune telling in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to clients while allowing fortune tellers to provide their services to clients with only minimal restrictions c the provisions of this subsection requiring a permit posting of fees providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation will make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortune teller to commit fraud or larceny and yet as informational regulations will not affect the nature of the information conveyed by the fortune teller nor the manner in which it is conveyed these regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the part of the fortune teller and will not therefore impose any undue burden on their practices d fortune telling for entertainment purposes as defined in this subsection does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous practitioner as would the practice with an individual client because it is done with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to deal with the private concerns of an individual e for these and other reasons the provisions of this subsection are necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the community 2 permit required no person shall conduct engage in carry on participate in

individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks automated teller machines or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who without permission wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections despite explicit instructions by drivers not to do so people driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with persons seeking money by offering to open car doors or locate parking spaces such activities carry with them an implicit threat to both persons and property d the city council is enacting this article pursuant to its police power as stated in article xi section 7 of the california constitution in

percent 259% slope and there is a contiguous ten 10 acre area of between eleven 11 to twenty and ninetenths percent 209% the ten 10 acres with an average slope of eleven 11 to twenty and ninetenths percent 209% can be used to recalculate allowable density 18 unitsunit per acre x 10 acres   18 units 3 for the purposes of this article floor area ratio far is defined as the ratio of the total gross square footage of the dwelling unit excluding both attached and detached garage square footage and any accessory structure on a lot to the square footage of the pad or that portion of the lot containing the dwelling and having a gradient of five percent 5% or less after constraints and performance criteria have been addressed to develop a maximum yield the maximum yields for a parcel is
