protection of the towns water bodies and groundwater and to safeguard the public health safety welfare and the environment increased and contaminated stormwater runoff associated with developed land uses and the accompanying increase in impervious surface are major causes of impairment of water quality and flow in lakes ponds streams rivers wetlands and groundwater in addition land disturbances can cause harmful impacts due to soil erosion and sedimentation a impairment of water quality and flow in lakes ponds streams rivers wetlands and groundwater  b contamination of drinking water supplies  c erosion of stream channels  d alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat  e flooding  and f overloading or clogging of municipal catch basins and municipal storm drainage systems therefore this construction and postconstruction stormwater management bylaw bylaw establishes stormwater management standards for the final conditions that result from development and redevelopment projects to minimize adverse impacts offsite and downstream which would be born by abutters townspeople and the general public in addition the bylaw establishes stormwater management standards for land disturbances that have harmful impacts of soil erosion and sedimentation the objectives of the bylaw are 83 a to require practices to control the flow of stormwater from new and redeveloped sites into the municipal storm drainage system in order to prevent flooding and erosion  b to protect groundwater and surface water from degradation  c to promote groundwater recharge and infiltration  d to prevent pollutants from entering the towns municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and to minimize discharge of pollutants from the ms4  e to ensure adequate longterm operation and maintenance of structural stormwater best management practices bmps so that they work as designed  f to require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation and control the volume and rate of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbances  g to ensure that soil erosion and sediment control measures and stormwater runoff control practices are incorporated into the site planning and design process and are implemented and maintained  h to encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management measures and better site design practices or lowimpact development practices such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of green space and other natural areas to the maximum extent practicable  i to require practices to control waste such as discarded building materials concrete truck washout chemicals litter and sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality  j to comply with state and federal statutes and regulations
