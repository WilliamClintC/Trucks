should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns p a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein q the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity r it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 59 s the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business or employee license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this ordinance and the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases t this ordinance is necessary and proper to provide for safety to

council does hereby ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of bountiful utah are subject to periodic inundation which may potentially result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood plains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses 1 in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 2 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  3 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  4 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  5 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  6 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 143 616102 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this

objectives the singlefamily residential zone r is established to provide areas for singlefamily detached dwellings on individual lots within the singlefamily residential zone are various subzones with individual criteria that have been created to address specific needs pertinent to the areas these subzones encompass a the residential foothill subzone is created to provide standards guidelines and criteria which permit reasonable development of private property while minimizing flooding erosion and other environmental hazards and which protect the natural scenic character of the foothill areas and which ensure the efficient expenditure of public funds b the goals to be achieved by the residential foothill subzone include but are not limited to the following 1 the protection of the public from natural hazards of storm water runoff and erosion by requiring drainage facilities and the minimal removal of natural vegetation while still allowing reasonable use of the land 2 the minimizing of the threat and damages of fire in foothill areas by establishing fire protection measures 3 the preservation of natural features wildlife habitat and open space consistent with the provisions of this title and state law 4  2 r  single family residential docx 4 the preservation of legal public access to mountain areas trails and natural drainage channels 5 the preservation and enhancement of

disturbance to the natural ground with the most harmony with natural conditions and with the greatest conformity with the purposes and requirements of this as possible under individual circumstances it is the finding of the city council that all possible circumstances and the best means of dealing with them cannot be anticipated in the preparation of these regulations therefore the city council may unless expressly stated to the contrary in this chapter grant a reasonable use exception to the provisions of this chapter to implement its purposes by modifying requirements in the rf subzone as individual circumstances may merit subject to the criteria set forth below the provisions set forth in this chapter regarding the rf subzone shall be the standard but when conditions merit a
