be cited as the township of cumru storm water management  statement of findings the township of cumru commissioners finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout  a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township of cumru and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d inadequate management of accelerated stormwater development throughout a watershed poses a threat to quality runoff resulting from surface and groundwater e stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality f impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage storm water runoff is of cumru storrnwater management

township of cumru stormwater management file 3022068 issued  rev l ordinance appendix d stormwater management district watershed map ordinance appendix e low impact development lid practices alternative approach for managing stormw ater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will mm1m1ze proposed conditions runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions reqmres careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the al temati ve approach  preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site protecting natnral depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a ~torm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff  volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent  possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or pervious bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measures other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding water quality degradation of receiving streamswater bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage ordinance appendix f west nile virus guidance this sburce is from the monroe county pa conservation district

source brodhead mcmichaels creeks watershed act 167 stormwater management 2304 the monroe county conservation district recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces the new stormwater policy being integrated into act 167 stormwater management regulations by the pa department of environmental protection dep will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans in addition to meet postconstruction antidegradation standards under the state national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permitting program applicants will be required to employ best management practices bmps to address nonpoint pollution concerns studies conducted throughout the united states have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants united states environmental protection agency 199 center for watershed protection 2000 from maryland to oregon studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surface increase in a watershed the streams in those watersheds become degraded cwp 2000 although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20% there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater bmps are not implemented although constructed wetlands and ponds aie desirable from a water quality perspective there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes the conservation district feels that although it may be a valid concern municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management mosquitoes the questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquitoborne west nile virus as is the case with all vectorborne maladies the life cycle of west nile virus is complicated traveling from mosquito to bird back to mosquito and then to other animals including humans culex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first documented cases from new york in 1999 this species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit pennsylvania along with c pipiens three other species have been identified as vectors of west nile virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors the four known vectors in ne pennsylvania are culex pipiens c restuans c salinarius and ochlerotatus japonicus all four of these species prefer and almost exclusively use artificial containers old tires rain gutters birdbaths etc as larval habitats in the case of c pipiens the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes the dirtier the water the better they like it the important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high the remaining four species aedes vexans ochlerotat us canadensis 0 triseriatus and 0 trivittatus are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests except the 0 trivittatus which did have one confirmed vector pool for west nile virus in pa during 2002 all four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains these species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days this can be mitigated however by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands stormwater facilities if a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops mosquitoes should not become a problem wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community if a wetland is plarmed proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators in natural wetlands predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes the design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding in particular species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable by limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface larvae lose protective cover and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes when incorporated into an open space design a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check publications from the pa department of health and the penn state cooperative extension concerning west nile virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers tires trash cans rain gutters bird baths as the most effective method to control vector mosquitoes conclusion the conservation district understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into stormwater designs as momoe county continues to grow conservation design groundwater recharge and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces when designed and constructed appropriately the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes bmp manuals california

procedures for projects meeting the land cover exemption criteria what are the act 167 stormwater management requirements pennsylvania act 167 was authorized on  32 ps pl 864 and gave pennsylvania municipalities the power to regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff surface and groundwater quantity and quality who is affected by these requirements the act 167 stormwater management requirements affect all new development in the township of cumru individual home construction projects on single family lots which are exempt under of this are not required to submit formal drainage plans to the municipality or county  however they are still required to address water quality and groundwater recharge criteria specified in this  do i require professional services to meet these requirements this brochure has been developed to assist the individual homeowner in meeting the water quality and groundwater recharge goals of this the guidelines presented in this brochure are followed the individual homeowner will not require professional services to comply with these water quality and groundwater recharge goals what do i need to send to the municipality even though a formal drainage plan is not required for individual lot owners a brief description of the proposed infiltration facilities including types of material to be used total impervious areas and volume

appropriateness depends on the amount of infiltration volume required and the amount of land available more than one method can be implemented on a site depending on site constraints dry wells should be used only for receiving runoff from roof drains infiltration trenches are appropriate for receiving runoff from driveways sidewalk or parking areas other methods may be appropriate but these should be discussed with the township engineer prior to installation dry wells dry wells are effective methods of infiltrating runoff from roof leaders these facilities should be located a minimum of 10 feet from the building foundation to avoid seepage problems a dry well can be either a structural prefabricated chamber or an excavated pit filled with aggregate construction of a dry well should be performed after all other areas of the site are stabilized to avoid clogging during construction compaction of the subgrade soil should be avoided and construction should be performed with only light machinery depth of dry wells in excess of 3 y feet should be avoided gravel fill should be an average 15  30 inches in diameter dry wells should be inspected at least four times annually as well as after large storm events figure i1 typical dry well configuration building foundation roof leader source maryland stonnwater design manual 2000 example sizing step 1  determine total impervious
