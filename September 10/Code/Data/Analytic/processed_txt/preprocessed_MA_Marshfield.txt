town of marshfield requires industrial commercial community facilities and residential uses except existing onefamily detached dwellings to provide documentation that demonstrates that the concentration of nitratenitrogen in groundwater resulting from these uses shall not exceed five parts per million ppm at the downgradient property boundary these requirements are based on the following findings whereas the town of marshfield does not have a sewer system to treat wastewater from development within its water resource protection district the disposal of this wastewater systems within the district poses a threat to the drinking water quality of the public supply wells the district is designed to protect the primary contaminant of concern coming from the septic systems is nitrogen 1 once nitrogen released from septic systems reaches groundwater it is not attenuated but it is diluted with recharge from precipitation road and roof runoff and lawn irrigation these dilution waters also transport some nitrogen though not as concentrated as septic system wastewater wastewater contributes between 70% and 80% of the nitrogen in groundwater in developed areas 2 excessive nitrogen in drinking water has been linked to serious health effects consumption of excessive nitratenitrogen by infants has been linked to methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome  nitrate occupies the hemoglobin site on red blood cells limiting the transport of oxygen blood there is also a concern that excessive nitrogen in drinking water can be converted to excessive nitrosamines carcinogenic nitrogen forms in stomach acid excessive nitrogen in groundwater has also been linked to excessive levels of other contaminants 3 a  4174 marshfield code  4175 c590 due to these health concerns the us environmental protection agency epa and the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep have adopted maximum contaminant levels in drinking water if these levels are exceeded in a drinking water supply well utilization of the well must cease and an alternative supply must be found treatment technology to remove excessive nitrogen from drinking water prior to its use is currently prohibitively expensive 4 since the town of marshfield has invested significant public funds in the development of its current drinking water supply and wishes to avoid the expense and potential health and economic concerns that excessive nitrogen in its drinking water would cause the town of marshfield has adopted a nitrogen loading assessment requirement in its zoning bylaw for development in its water resource protection district 5 applicability the following projects which require a special permit in accordance with the table of uses in the marshfield zoning bylaw71 shall be subject to the provisions of this regulation 1 new commercial and industrial development  2 new community facilities  new residential uses including residential subdivisions of five or more new lots  and 3 existing commercial industrial or community facilities where a change of use is proposed that will increase the concentration of nitrogen on the site 4 b nitrogen loading assumptions and calculations nitrogen loading for the purposes of this regulation nitrogen loading shall be calculated using the attached form titled town of marshfield  planning board nitrogen loading calculation form 1 nonresidential wastewater flow although title 5 wastewater flows will be used conventionally in the calculation of nitrogen loading commercial and industrial development and community facilities may use measured water use flows to calculate nitrogen loads from wastewater in order to use measured water use flows an applicant must present annual water bills or equivalent information to support the use of these flows it is recommended that measured water use information from at least three comparable developments or three years worth of water records be provided the town of marshfield planning board shall determine the validity 2 c 71editors note see  305504 72editors note the form is available at the planning board office  4175 charter  4175 c591 of supporting information and may reject or modify the use of wastewater flows other than title 5 wastewater flows residential wastewater flow residential developments may use a wastewater flow that is the mean of standard title 5 wastewater flows and modified title 5 flows based on occupancy data modified title 5 flows shall be calculated by multiplying actual title 5 flows by the fraction represented by dividing the average singlefamily residence occupancy in the town by two times the number of proposed bedrooms average occupancy shall equal total town population divided by occupied housing units

approved denitrification system 19 4  4175 marshfield code  4175 c592 source of nitrogen concentration of nitrogen milligrams per liter wastewater effluent from a centralized wastewater treatment facility 10 runoff from roadways and driveways 15 runoff from rooftops 075 rainfall runoff on natural surfaces 005 nutrient loading from turf fertilization to calculate the loading of nitrogen from turf areas the applicant shall first multiply the area of turf by the estimated application rate of 30 pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet of turf the applicant shall then multiply this value by 025 assuming a 25% leaching rate to groundwater a the area of turf associated with a residential development shall be equal to 50% of the lot area the planning board may allow for a reduction in this value based upon area calculations performed from an engineered site plan where landscaped areas are proposed to be unfertilized on a site plan the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide assurance that the area will not be fertilized in the foreseeable future based on plant selection and landscape design b 5 recharge rates recharge rates assigned to the site shall be based on preexisting hydrologic soils groups in accordance with the following table nrcs hydrologic soils group recharge rate inches per year a soils 24 b soils 18 c soils 10 d soils 3 wetlands and surface waters 0 6 nutrient loading from impervious surfaces nitrogen loading from impervious surfaces will be calculated by multiplying the appropriate nitrogen loading coefficient by the recharge rate associated with the soil that will be covered by the impervious surface this approach is based on the assumption that postdevelopment recharge volumes shall approximate predevelopment recharge rates pursuant to the massachusetts stormwater 7  4175 charter  4175 c593  4176 fees all applications shall be accompanied by two certified checks made payable to the order of the town of marshfield one check shall be for administrative standards where an alternative approach is used specifically for redevelopment pursuant to the massachusetts stormwater standards the planning board may accept annual recharge volume calculations associated with impervious cover that are provided and stamped by the applicants engineer the final average concentration of nitrogen the final average concentration of nitrogen in groundwater shall be calculated by dividing the total annual mass load of nitrogen by the total annual volume of recharge and shall be expressed as milligrams per liter mgl 8 aggregate concentration calculations for those applicants who require a special permit pursuant to  3051303e4d of the zoning bylaw an aggregate concentration calculation shall be developed to demonstrate that the concentration of nitrogen in groundwater shall not exceed five mgl at the boundary of the zone i for the public water supply description of calculation the aggregate concentration calculation is used to examine the aggregate effect of adding larger individual wastewater systems to the district these analyses determine the area that the wastewater effluent will occupy on its way to the zone i boundary and the extent to which the flow is or is not diluted by overlying land use activity similar to onsite nitrogen loading calculations the aggregate concentration calculations will use a mass balance approach dividing the total load of nitrogen from overlying land uses by the annual volume of recharge to determine an average downgradient concentration 1 area of impact aoi the nitrogen aggregation calculation shall first determine the aoi created by the plume from the leach field of the onsite wastewater treatment system the applicant shall develop a flow net analysis that includes a groundwater mounding analysis to delineate the wastewater plume as it travels from the leach field to the edge of the zone i 2 calculating nitrogen concentration the concentration of nitrogen at the zone i boundary shall be calculated using the same assumptions as those provided in  4174b of these regulations to estimate the different land use categories for areas within the aoi that are off site the applicant shall use best available information from readily available gis databases interpretation of aerial photography to estimate the coverage of different land features may be allowed along with any vector files that represent impervious cover the planning board shall make the final determination as to which data is the best suited for the analysis 3 d  4175 marshfield code  4176 c594
