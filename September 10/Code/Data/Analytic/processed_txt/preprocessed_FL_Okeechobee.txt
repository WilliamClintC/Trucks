fiveyear community investment program cip includes a transportation capital improvement that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development b the city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the five year cip where one of the following conditions apply 1 the city adds the improvement to the five year cip no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the comprehensive plan provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by fs  16b1  or 2 if the funds in the fiveyear cip are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement the city may enter into a proportionate fair share agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of

upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the cip the okeechobee county mpo transportation improvement program or the florida department of transportation work program where such information is not available the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods 1 an analysis by the city administrator or designee of costs adjusted by the florida department of transportation price trends index from the previous year by cross section type that incorporates date from recent projects  or 2 the most recent issue of florida department of transportation transportation costs as adjusted based upon the type of cross section urban or rural  locally available data from recent projects on acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events d if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section e if the city has accepted rightofway dedication for the proportionate fair share payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the okeechobee county property appraiser or at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair share obligation for that development then the developer must also pay the difference  122007 transportation facilities impact fee credit a proportionate fair share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution is calculated additionally if the proportionate fair share contribution is based on only a portion of the developments traffic the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fair share contribution is based b at the time the proportionate fair share obligation is being determined the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development if the developers proportionate fair share obligation is less than the developments anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee then the developer must pay the difference to the city  122007 proportionate fair share agreements a should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair share agreement then the agreement shall be considered null and void and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this article b payment of the proportionate fair share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable if the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement then the proportionate fair share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to determination of proportionate fair share obligation and adjusted accordingly c developer improvements authorized under this article involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements on receipt of a warranty bond the form of the warranty bond shall be approved by the city attorney d developer improvements authorized under this article not involving dedications to city must be

of intersections shall take into consideration both safety and efficiency of access to abutting parcels every parcel shall abut an approved private street an approved access easement or a street dedicated to and accepted by the city for maintenance 12 minimization of traffic movements streets through traffic shall be discouraged use of discontinuities in local street patterns by offsetting local street intersections and by channeling or controlling street medians along peripheral major or collector streets this will reduce the amount and speed of traffic thereby making local streets more safe and amenable to residents 13 logic and consistency in street numbering and naming a consistent and logical pattern shall be developed to simplify local street naming and numbering to assist visitors in locating addresses and facilitate access by emergency vehicles delivery vehicles etc 14 efficient traffic circulation and development patterns driveways intersection placement and access shall be controlled so that no parcels require direct access to major or collector streets provisions shall be provided for continuing existing principal streets from adjoining areas subdivisions where streets are extended to subdivision boundaries and abut either undeveloped adjoining land or connect to collector or arterial roads the location of the subdivision street shall be coordinated with the city administrator to facilitate future street development in adjoining areas for overall efficiency of traffic flow and for safety considerations of future intersections 15 design for purpose intended local streets shall not be overdesigned or overbuilt ie extra width higher speed etc to a degree which will detract from the residential character and which will encourage higher use and higher traffic speed the use of curvilinear alignment and discontinuities is encouraged to minimize speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour and discourage 6 minimum of intersections intersections shall be kept to the minimum number practicable particularly between local streets and collector or arterial roads to reduce accident potential consistent with other requirements t intersections are preferable to fourway or crosstype intersections streets shall be arranged to intersect as closely as possible to right angles in no case shall streets intersect at an angle of less than 75 degrees 2
