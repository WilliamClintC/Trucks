proliferation of towers and the adverse visual impact associated with such proliferation and clustering collocation of antennas on existing towers or attached wcf shall take precedence over the construction of new towers provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following 1 a tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower 2 if additional height is required for collocation then the tower shall be relocated to accommodate all setback requirements required by the increased height 3 the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city taking into consideration the intent and purpose of this section and other requirements of this article 4 owners of existing towers shall not be permitted to charge excessive fees for collocation b additional requirements 1 collocation is required as a condition of the wcf authorization permit no new structures are permitted unless an applicant demonstrates the inadequacy of existing facilities as provided for in this article if a wcf provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the city in such a case such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect 2 in addition the city may take such action as allowed by statute and ordinances to require conformity including requiring collocation and revocation of the wcf authorization permit and the annual wcf permit the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the city 3 collocation of an additional wcf on an existing wcf is treated the same as construction of a new wcf and requires compliance with all terms of this article each separate wcf collocated on the same tower or structure is subject separately to the requirements of this article 4 for all collocations served by an accessory building there must be a single architecturally uniform accessory building for all operators at the wcf    maintenance and repair a as a condition of issuance of the annual wcf permit the wireless communications provider must submit and the building official must approve a maintenance plan the planning commission and city council shall in its discretion with respect to the design and appearance of the tower and all accessory buildings require construction and maintenance which creates harmony with the surrounding area minimizes distraction reduces visibility maximizes aesthetic appearance and ensures compatibility with surroundings

applicable ordinances of the city and any applicable state or federal regulations b the landowner and wireless communications provider are jointly responsible for maintaining the site in a neat safe and orderly condition both during and after construction of the facility to ensure the structural integrity of towers a tower shall be maintained by the wireless communications providers in compliance with standards contained in applicable state and local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the electronic industries association as amended from time to time if upon inspection the city concludes that a wcf fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property then upon notice being provided to the wcf provider the provider and landowner shall have 30 days to bring such wcf into compliance failure to do so shall constitute grounds for the removal of the wcf at the providers and landowners expense c each facility is subject to inspection as the building official may deem necessary at a minimum each facility must be inspected annually and must pass inspection as a condition of issuance of the annual wcf permit inspections will include an assessment not only of the structural soundness and overall safety of the facility but will also address routine maintenance and repair issues d failure to pass inspection at any time shall be deemed a violation of this article and subject the wireless communications provider and landowner to all actions allowed by this article and by local state and federal law e the wireless communications provider shall be required as part of the annual permit report to submit an inspection of the wcf inspecting such aspects of the wcf as the building official may require

provided in this section upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events 1 when the wcf has not been used for 60 days or more it will be deemed to be abandoned for purposes of this section the removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility or the cessation of operations transmission andor reception of radio signals shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse 2 six months after new technology is available at reasonable cost as determined by the city council which permits the operation of the communications system without the requirement of the tower or with a tower which is lower andor more compatible with the area 3 when the facility is not maintained in accordance with the standards set forth in this article and written notice of the deficiencies is

failure to qualify for renewal of the annual wcf permit b the situations in which removal of a facility is required as set forth in subsection a of this section may be applied and limited to portions of a facility c upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal or lowering of the tower specified in subsection a of this section the wireless communications provider and landowner

communications providers using the wcf and a description of their use of the facility changes to the information about the wcf the wireless communications provider or the owner of the property on which the wcf is located contained in the original application the annual report is due on the anniversary date of the date of issuance of the wcf authorization permit c nonassignability no wcf construction or annual wcf permit is assignable without the written consent of the city d resubmission after ten years after ten years of operation the wireless communications provider and landowner
