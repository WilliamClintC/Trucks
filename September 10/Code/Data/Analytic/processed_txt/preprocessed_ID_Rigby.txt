within jefferson county and as such is subject to the countys land use zoning which as of  is zoned commercial two c2  772 purpose a this chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by idaho code1 it is hereby stated that certain constructions or structures may constitute hazards to aerial operation and navigation and such hazards may endanger the lives andor property of users of the city of rigby airport additionally if the construction or structure in effect reduces the size of the area available for taking off maneuvering and landing of aircraft the construction andor structure destroys or impairs the utility of federal airspace the airport and the public investment therein b it is further found that certain activities and uses of land in the immediate vicinity of the airport are not compatible with normal airport operations and may if not regulated also endanger the lives of the participants adversely affect their health or otherwise limit the accomplishment of normal activities accordingly it is declared 1 that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and injury to the region served by the city of rigby airport  2 that it is necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment hazards to the airport be prevented  3 that the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the police powers without compensation  4 that appropriate notice be given to property owners buyers or sellers within a reasonable operating radius of the airport informing them that the airport exists that airport operations may occur at all hours of the day or night throughout the calendar year and persons within that operating radius should not expect relief from reasonable airport operation the city of rigby airport board subscribes to the following fair disclosure statement the statement means a notification to prospective buyers of property near or adjacent to the airport that they may be exposed to potentially impactive levels of aircraft overflights these statements in no way abrogate an individuals right to take later action against the airport but rather give the buyer a fair notice use of a fair disclosure statement is not meant to provide pilots crews owners of aircraft or any other person protection from liability for negligence committed on their part c it is further declared that both 1 the prevention of creating or establishing airport hazards 2 the elimination removal alteration mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interest in land  773 summary of effect the provisions of this chapter may be summarized as follows a for structures and trees on the airport property heights may be restricted as determined by the airport board subsection 776a1 of this chapter  sterling codifiers inc  80201 b for structures and trees off the airport property heights of less than thirty feet 30 above airport elevation are exempted from the requirements of this chapter subsection 776a3 of this chapter except that structures and trees in the primary zones subsection 775a of this chapter and visual approach zones subsection 775c of this chapter immediately off the ends of each airport runway may be prohibited or restricted in height c for structures and trees off the airport property which may exceed thirty feet 30 above airport elevation certain zones are established in section 775 of this chapter these zones provide sloping criteria based on location from the active runways at the airport the zones are more restrictive to the ends of the takeoff and landing runways than to the sides of the runways  774 definitions as used in this chapter unless the context otherwise requires airport the city of rigby airport u56

certain zones which include all of the land and airspace within instrument approach zones visual approach zones transitional zones horizontal zones and conical zones such areas and zones are shown in approximation on the city of rigby airport zoning map on file in the city the various zones are hereby established and defined as follows a primary zone a primary zone is centered longitudinally on a runway when the runway has a specially prepared surface the primary zone extends two hundred feet 200 beyond each end of that runway  but when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface the primary zone ends at each end of the runway the elevation of any point on the primary zone coincides with the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline the width  sterling codifiers inc  81201 of a primary zone is two hundred fifty feet 250 for utility runways having nonprecision instrument approach the width of the primary zone of a runway will be that width prescribed in this subsection for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway 1 effect the primary zone has the effect of limiting the heights of structures or trees off the ends of active hard surface runways for a distance of two hundred feet 200 b approach zone an approach zone is longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extends outward and upward from each end of the primary zone an approach zone is applied to each end of each runway based upon type of approach available or planned for that runway end 1 inner edge the inner edge of the approach zone is the same width as the primary zone and it expands uniformly to a width of a one thousand two hundred fifty feet 1250 for that end of a utility runway with only visual approach  b two thousand feet 2000 for that end of a utility runway with an instrument approach 2 approach the approach zone for utility runways with a nonprecision instrument approach andor visual approach extends for a horizontal distance of five thousand feet 5000 at a slope of twenty to one  3 outer width the outer width of an approach zone to an end of a runway will be that width prescribed in this subsection for the most precise approach existing or planned for that runway 4 effect the effect of the approach zone at the city of rigby airport is to further extend the twenty to one  slope and height limitations of visual and nonprecision zones to a distance of five thousand feet 5000 from the active runways c visual approach zone a visual approach zone is established at each of all visual runways the visual approach zone shall have a width of two hundred fifty feet 250 at a distance of two hundred feet 200 beyond each end of the runway widening thereafter uniformly to a width of four hundred fifty feet 450 at a distance of one thousand feet 1000 beyond each end of the runway the zone centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway and the zone slope will be twenty to one  1 effect the visual zone has the effect of limiting the heights of structures or trees off the ends of visual approach runways for a distance of one thousand feet 1000 from the height of zero 0 on the airport property section 776 of this chapter to approximately fifty feet 50 in height at a distance of one thousand feet 1000 from the end of the active runways d nonprecision approach zone a nonprecision approach zone is established at each end of all nonprecision runways for noninstrument landings and takeoffs the nonprecision approach zone shall have a width of two hundred fifty feet 250 at a distance of two hundred feet 200 beyond each end of the runway widening thereafter uniformly to a width of four hundred fifty feet 450 at a distance of one thousand feet 1000 beyond each end of the runway the zone centerline will be the continuation of the centerline of the runway and the zone slope will be twenty to one  1 effect the effect of the nonprecision approach zone is identical to that of the visual approach zone above e transitional zone transitional zones extend outwards and upwards at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven to one  from the sides of the primary zone and from the sides of the approach zones transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zone which project beyond the limits of the conical zone extend a distance of five thousand feet 5000 measures horizontally from the edge of the approach zone and at right angles to the runway centerline 1 effect the effect of the transitional zone is to limit heights of structures or trees from zero 0 at the edge of the active runway section 776 of this chapter to approximately one hundred fifty feet 150 above airport elevation at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet 5000 from the edge of the primary zone on a slope of seven to one  f horizontal zone a horizontal zone is established consisting of a plane one hundred fifty feet 150 above the established airport elevation the perimeter of the horizontal zone being established by swinging arcs of specified radius from the center of each end of the primary zone of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by line tangent to those arcs the radius of each arc is 1 five thousand feet 5000 for all runways designated as utility or visual  and 2 ten thousand feet 10000 for all runways other than utility designated as instrument runways the radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value that value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway when a five thousand foot 5000 arc is encompassed by tangents connected to adjacent ten thousand foot 10000 the five thousand foot 5000 arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal zone 1 effect the effect of the horizontal zone is to limit the height of structures or trees to less than one hundred fifty feet 150 above airport elevation for a distance of approximately five thousand feet 5000 horizontally from the active runway g conical zone a conical zone extends outwards and upwards from the periphery of the horizontal zone at a slope of twenty to one  for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet 4000 1 effect the effect of the conical zone is to provide additional height limitations for structures or trees a distance greater than five thousand feet 5000 horizontally from the active runway as of  the city of rigby airport has no approved or planned instrument approaches the runways are open for visual approaches at all hours of the day and night weather permitting however nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting or discouraging future development of instrument approaches at the airport faa regulations for such approaches may require future modifications of this chapter runwaytaxiway lighting can be activated by pilots prior to a visual take off or landing and may remain active for a period of time following such activities  776 height limitations a except as otherwise provided in this chapter no structure tower or tree shall be erected altered allowed to grow or maintained in any surface created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such a zone such height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows  sterling codifiers inc  82201 1 conflict where an area is covered by more than one height limitation the more restrictive limitation shall prevail 2 airport property on the airport property as established by the airport board in accordance with faa guidelines 3 excepted height limitations nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting growth construction or maintenance of any tree or structure off the airport property to a height up to thirty feet 30 above the airport except as provided for primary and visual approach zones in subsections 775a and c of this chapter 4 nonprecision instrument or visual approach zone no trees or structure may penetrate the nonprecision instrument or visual approach zone for any utility runway 5 transitional zone no tree or structure may penetrate the transitional zone for any runway 6 horizontal zone no tree or structure may penetrate the horizontal zone for any runway 7 conical zone no tree or structure may penetrate the conical zone for any runway  777 use restrictions notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter no use may be made of land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to a create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft  b make it difficult for aviators to distinguish between airport lights and other lights  c result in glare coherent light beams or other visual distractions to aviators using the airport  d impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport  or e otherwise endanger the taxiing off maneuvering or landing of aircraft at the airport  778 nonconforming uses a regulations are not retroactive the regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal lowering or other changes or alterations of any structures or trees not in conformance with this chapter as of  or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use reasonably established prior to that date nothing in this chapter shall require any change in the construction alteration or intended use of any structure the construction or alteration of which began prior to  and which has diligently prosecuted b notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a of this section the owners of any nonconforming structures or trees is hereby required to permit the installation operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport board to indicate the presence of such hazards to aviators in the vicinity of the airport such markers and
