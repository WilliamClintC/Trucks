oxygen demand cod greater than 625 mgl 3 where the dco has approved the admission of high strength bod tss or cod into the potw that discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the dco the surcharge may be calculated on bod and tss values different from the normal concentrations of 250 mgl or a cod concentration of 25 times that of the bod concentration 4 at the discretion of the dco users may be surcharged either as a individual facilities with flow and concentration data from the single user or b groups of similar facilities or a class of comparable uses with analogous wastewater characteristics with flow and concentration data averaged from typical users selected by the dco 5 in no case shall a discharge of abnormally elevated conventional pollutants bod tss or cod be accepted that will prevent the potw from meeting its limits or damage the potw or endanger or harm any person 6 the surcharge will be billed monthly in addition to the usual monthly sewer service

must be provided within five days a a description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time

establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof e users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon

damage means damage which can reasonably be expected to occur if the user did not elect to perform the bypass such impairment would be a substantial physical damage to property  b damage to the users treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable  or c substantial and permanent loss of natural resources severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these

dco may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance
