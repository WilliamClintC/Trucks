24hour duration assuming hydrologic soil group b soils according to methods in the hydrology guide for minnesota published by the soil conservation service d the city council finds that assigning

peddlers and solicitors 1 2 st anthony  business regulations chapter 110 sexuallyoriented businesses city council findings 11002 standards for sexuallyoriented businesses  11001 city council findings a the city council has reviewed various reports regarding sexuallyoriented businesses and has considered studies done in other cities ordinances of other cities court cases regarding sexuallyoriented businesses and other materials pertaining to adult uses and sexuallyoriented businesses in particular the city council has reviewed materials related to the adverse secondary characteristics related to adult uses and sexuallyoriented businesses the city council has reviewed evidence taken from the city of minneapolis where studies have shown a strong correlation between sexuallyexplicit businesses and increased crime rates and from the city of st paul where studies have suggested such a correlation as well as a possible correlation between sexuallyoriented businesses and depressed property values the city council has also relied upon evidence taken from reported court cases involving other municipalities which are smaller suburban cities in minnesota and in other states the city council believes that the experiences of the cities of minneapolis and st paul are relevant to the city of st anthony because of their close proximity and that the smaller cities involved in cases from minnesota and other states are similar in their position as relatively small suburbs to major metropolitan areas b after careful consideration of these materials and other materials including the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses minnesota attorney generals office 661989 and in order to prevent the problems that cities around the nation have encountered with the unregulated location of adult uses and sexuallyoriented businesses in their communities the st anthony city council has arrived at the following findings and conclusions 1 the city council finds that sexuallyoriented businesses have adverse secondary characteristics particularly when they may be accessible to minors or are located near residential properties or schools churches temples synagogues daycare centers libraries recreational areas and parks and the businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending or using the properties 2 sexuallyoriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which the businesses are located 3 4 st anthony  business regulations 3 sexuallyoriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which the businesses are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents 4 the concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses in 1 area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which the businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses the presence of the businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be very detrimental in many cases other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area declining real estate values which can result from the concentration of the businesses erode the citys tax base and contribute to overall urban blight 5 the regulation of the location and operation of sexuallyoriented businesses is warranted to prevent the adverse secondary effects of the businesses on the citys crime rate its retail trade its property values and in general the quality of the citys neighborhoods commercial and industrial districts and urban life 1993 01  11002 standards for sexuallyoriented businesses a generally the following standards shall

the area of the wall to which it is applied passed 4222008 penalty see  1099 15529 dynamic displays a findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of roadway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character spacing requirements enforced by the city interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for multiple dynamic displays to exist along a corridor if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a corridor the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate signs 140 additionally a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign the
