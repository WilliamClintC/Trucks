oswego finds that the coastal erosion hazard area is prone to erosion from action of lake ontario such erosion may be caused by the action of waves currents running along the shore and winddriven water and ice such areas are also prone to erosion caused by the wind runoff of rain water along the surface of the land or groundwater seepage as well as by human activities such as construction navigation and certain forms of recreation experiences coastal erosion which causes extensive damage to publicly and privately owned property and to natural resources as well as endangering human lives when this occurs individuals and private businesses suffer significant economic losses as do the city and the state economies either directly damage or indirectly of economic return large public expenditures may also be necessitated for the removal of debris and damaged structures and replacement of essential public facilities and services experiences erosionrelated problems that are often contributed to by mans building without considering the potential for damage to property by undertaking activities which destroy natural protective features such as dunes or vegetation  by building structures intended for erosion prevention which may exacerbate erosion conditions on adjacent or nearby property  and by water action produced by wakes from boats is the subject of programs which foster erosion protection structures either with private or public finds which are costly often only partially effective over time and may even be harmful to adjacent or nearby properties in some sections of the city major erosion protection structures of great length would be required to effectively reduce future damage due to erosion  956 definitions the following terms used in this chapter

conversion factor of 834 pounds per milligram per liter per million gallons the total industrial flow shall be determined by adding the maximum flow from each permitted user a limit using the industrial contributory flow method is determined by dividing the mail listed below for a pollutant by the portion of each permitted users contributory flow and by a conversion factor of 834 pounds

limits are applicable to wastewater effluents at the point just prior to discharge into the potw and are to be applied as daily maximum limits these limits are to be included in wastewater discharge permits independent of any massbased limits as specified in this section if a permitted user can demonstrate that a pollutant is not present in his or her wastewater discharge at levels above the

stringent limit is applicable to the potw discharge as specified in other sections of this article and is included in this permit if both concentration and massbased limits are included in an
