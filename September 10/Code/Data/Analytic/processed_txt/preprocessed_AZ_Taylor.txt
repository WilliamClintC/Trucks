findings based on public testimony and other evidence before it including information studies and court decisions from other jurisdictions and in accordance with ars section 9461 the town of taylor makes the following legislative findings and statement of purpose the town of taylor recognizes that some activities which occur in connection with adultoriented businesses are protected as expression under the first amendment to the united states constitution the town of taylor further recognizes that first amendment rights are among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights the town is aware however that adultoriented businesses may and do generate secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare among these secondary effects are a prostitution and other sexrelated offenses b drug use and dealing c health risks spread of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases and d infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of drug and sexrelated business activities laundering of money and other illicit conduct this chapter is not intended to interfere with legitimate expression but to avoid and mitigate the secondary effects enumerated above specifically the town of taylor finds the licensing of persons who operate and manage adultoriented businesses and persons who provide adult services will further the goals of this chapter by enabling the town to ascertain if an applicant is underage or has engaged in criminal or other behavior of the sort this chapter is designed to limit this information will enable the town to allocate law enforcement resources effectively and otherwise protect the community the town of taylor finds that limiting proximity and contact between adult service providers and patrons promotes the goal of reducing prostitution and other casual sexual conduct and the attendant risk of sexually transmitted diseases the town of taylor finds the foregoing to be true with respect to places where alcohol is served and where it is not the town of taylor finds that individual and interactive sexual activities in adult video facilities pose a risk of sexually transmitted disease especially aids and that the booth configuration options of this chapter will reduce that risk the town of taylor finds that the harmful secondary effects of adultoriented businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or during late night hours the fees established for licenses and permits in this chapter are based on the estimated cost of implementation

other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter  variance procedure nature of variances appeal board conditions for variances  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the town council of the town of taylor arizona to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate   appeal board athe floodplain board of the town of taylor arizona shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this title bthe floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title cin passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and 1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive or general plan and floodplain management program for that area  9the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges dupon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this title the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title eany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by ars title 26 chapter 2 article 2 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the navajo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land fthe floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency   conditions for variances agenerally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided the procedures of chapters 1420 and 1425 ttc have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon a 1showing of good and sufficient cause  2determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in ttc in the definition of functionally dependent use  and 4determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause

dwelling unit  conducted entirely within the dwelling unit and carried on by one or more persons one of which resides within the dwelling unit  provided that the use is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for residence purposes and does not change the character thereof or adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential zoning district of which it is part in general a home occupation is an accessory use so located and conducted that the average neighbor under normal circumstances would not be aware of its existence all storage associated with the home occupation is encouraged to be stored within the dwelling or its accessory structures and any exterior storage must be screened from public view by an opaque wall or fence any indoor storage construction alterations or electrical or mechanical equipment used for the home occupation shall not change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in which it is located it is the intent of this chapter to eliminate as home occupations all uses except those that conform to the standards set forth in this chapter      terms and conditions home occupations are a permitted accessory use in residential zoning districts only so long as all of the following conditions are observed asuch occupation shall employ at least one person who resides within the residence  bno use
