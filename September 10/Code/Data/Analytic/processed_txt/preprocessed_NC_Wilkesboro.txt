necessary commercial and educational facilities conveniently located to such housing and to other areas of the community which require such facilities  to encourage innovations in residential and commercial development so that the growing demands of the population may be met by great variety in type design and layout of the buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space and so that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation and shops conveniently located to each other may extend to all citizens and residents of the town  to encourage a more efficient use

delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the town council of wilkesboro north carolina does ordain as follows 2findings of fact athe flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of wilkesboro are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards 3statement of purpose it is the purpose of this subchapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 4objectives the objectives of this subchapter are to aprotect human life safety health and general welfare  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dminimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  eminimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  fhelp
