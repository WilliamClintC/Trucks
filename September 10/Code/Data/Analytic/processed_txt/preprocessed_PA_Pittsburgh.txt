pursuant to applicable federal and state law is authorized to grant one 1 or more nonexclusive franchises to construct operate maintain and reconstruct cable systems within the city 2 the council finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens lives and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to the city at the same time the rapidly emerging role of the cable modem as an integrated broadband communications platform coupled with the relative lack of competition faced by the incumbent cable operator within the city limits necessitates a finding that local government has a legitimate and vital role to play in regulating cable services in a manner that ensures customer service while at the same time fostering competition to the extent permitted under law the council further finds that the public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the city or such persons as the city designates 3 in order to ensure that the city and its residents receive state of the art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves all franchises granted pursuant to this be subject to periodic review and modifications to keep current with changing law technology and services it is the intent of this provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable service to residents of the city and any franchises issued pursuant to this be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof 4 the council further finds that ongoing industry consolidation has resulted in less local accountability and that therefore stringent customer service standards including liquidated damage provisions may be the only practical means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise agreement noncompliance to the city and its residents  42502  definitions

medical counseling and treatment is important for residents and visitors to the city the exercise of a persons right to protest or counsel against certain medical procedures is a first amendment activity that must be balanced against another persons right to obtain medical counseling and treatment in an unobstructed manner  and the city of pittsburgh bureau of police has been consistently

and indefinite appropriation of policing services which is being provided to the neglect of the law enforcement needs of the zones in which these facilities exist the city seeks a more efficient and

the first duty of the governments of the city of pittsburgh and the commonwealth of pennsylvania is to protect their people  and 2 as demonstrated by the following findings and purposes gun violence presents a significant and undeniable public safety risk to the people of pittsburgh and pennsylvania and both the city and the commonwealth have a moral imperative to take lawfully available steps to reduce gun violence  and 3 empirical study and recent history demonstrate that assault weapons and large capacity magazines should be prohibited because they present an unacceptable and needless public safety risk prohibitions of assault weapons and large capacity magazines are correlated with reductions in mass shootings and the use of assault weapons and large capacity magazines results in a higher number of fatalities and injuries during mass shootings and other serious crimes including murders of police officers shooters using assault weapons and large capacity magazines can fire more rounds more quickly than shooters using other guns more suitable for selfdefense and fire rounds with greater destructive capacity that tragic truth has been proven and reproven in mass shootings around the country including on  at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh especially in a crowded urban jurisdiction like this one there is no legitimate need for assault weapons and large capacity magazines that can justify the consequences of tolerating the proliferation of militarystyle weaponry in the community  and 4 the united states supreme court has recognized that the right protected by the second amendment is not absolute the pennsylvania supreme court has recognized likewise with regard to of the pennsylvania constitution courts in many jurisdictions have thus upheld prohibitions on assault weapons large capacity magazines and other weaponry that poses a particular threat to public safety which leave many other options for selfdefense and other legitimate uses of firearms  and 5 the city council recognizes that 18 pa cs  6120a and 53 pa cs  2962g restrict municipal regulation of ownership possession transfer and transportation of firearms and as to 18 pa cs  612 ammunition and ammunition components and that pennsylvania courts including the supreme court of pennsylvania have concluded that municipalities have no authority to wholly prohibit ownership possession transportation and transfer of assault weapons under existing pennsylvania law  and 6 the city council also recognizes its responsibility to respect governing law and thus may not impose a prohibition on ownership possession transfer or transportation of assault weapons unless and until governing law allows it to become effective  and 7 a second class city has the power under 53 ps  231 and city council has the authority under the city of pittsburghs home rule charter to regulate prevent and punish the discharge of firearms rockets powder fireworks or any other dangerous combustible material in the streets lots grounds alleys or in the vicinity of any buildings  to prevent and punish the carrying of concealed deadly weapons  and 8 the city council has authority under 53 ps  3703 to regulate or to prohibit and prevent the sale and use of fireworks firecrackers sparklers and other pyrotechnics in such cities and the unnecessary firing and discharge of firearms in or into the highways and other public places thereof and to pass all necessary ordinances regulating or forbidding the same and prescribing penalties for their violation  and 9 the city council hereby calls upon and petitions the pennsylvania general assembly either to protect all pennsylvanians by prohibiting assault weapons or to allow the elected representatives of pittsburgh and other municipalities to honor their own constituents justified demands for protection  and 10 the city council has authority to legislate regarding the use of firearms as distinguished from their ownership possession transfer or transportation in order to protect members of the public  and 11 appropriate restrictions on the use of assault weapons will promote public safety even if not as completely as a prohibition both by imposing criminal liability on those who would use assault weapons in public spaces and by allowing police officers to intercede earlier and deter future tragedies iii eff 4919

health and public safety crisis in the united states  and 3 from 2013 to 201 the centers for disease control and prevention reported that the average number of firearm deaths for all ages was thirtysix thousand three hundred eightythree 36383 per year and the average number of firearm deaths for persons under eighteen 18 years old was one thousand four hundred ninetynine 1499 per year  and 4 from 2013 to 201 seven thousand five hundred seventeen 7517 pennsylvania residents died from a firearm injury including three hundred one 301 children under the age of eighteen 18  and 5 from 2013 to 201 a child or teen under the age of eighteen 18 was killed by gunfire in pennsylvania every six 6 days on average  and 6 law enforcement agencies in pittsburgh and allegheny county have partnered with the national shooting sports foundation to distribute free gun locks to pittsburgh residents childsafe  and 7 a february 2018 politicomorning consult poll found that seventysix 76 percent of registered voters across america supported requiring that all gun owners store their guns in a safe storage unit  and 8 every year in the united states on average more than two hundred fifty 250 children under eighteen 18 gain access to a gun and unintentionally shoot themselves or someone else and nearly six hundred 600 more die by suicide performed with a gun  and 9 storing household guns locked unloaded or separate from the ammunition is associated with reductions in the risk of selfinflicted shootings among and unintentional shootings by children and teenagers  and 10 an estimated 46 million american children and teens under eighteen 18 still live in homes with at least one 1 gun that is loaded and unlocked despite the lifesaving effect that responsible gun storage can have  and 11 available evidence as compiled by the rand corporation indicates that child access prevention laws or safe storage laws reduce selfinflicted fatal or nonfatal firearm injuries among youth and reduce unintentional firearm injuries or unintentional firearm deaths among children  and 12 over twentytwo thousand 22000 americans every year including over one thousand 1000 children and teens die by firearm suicide  and 13 a metaanalysis of fourteen 14 different scientific studies concluded that access to a firearm triples the risk of death by suicide of anyone in the household  and 14 among commonly used methods of selfharm firearms are by far the most lethal with a fatality rate of approximately eightyfive 85 percent compared to less than five 5 percent with other methods such that while firearms are used in less than six 6 percent of suicide attempts over half of suicide deaths result from suicide attempts performed with firearms  and 15 extreme risk protection order laws have been shown to help prevent firearm suicides as shown by the empirical evidence of reduced suicide rates under connecticuts and indianas laws  and 16 extreme risk protection order laws can also prevent gun crimes as an analysis of mass shootings from 2009 to 2017 revealed that in 51 percent of incidents the shooter exhibited warning signs that he posed a danger to himself or others before the shooting  and 17 the city council recognizes that 18 pa cs  6120a and 53 pa cs  2962g restrict municipal regulation of ownership possession transfer and transportation of firearms and as to 18 pa cs

following site conditions that may prevent the utilization of green infrastructure and low impact development technologies and stormwater strategies such as infiltration evapotranspiration and harvesting and reuse 1 the conditions on the site preclude the use of infiltration practices due to the presence of shallow bedrock contaminated soils landslide prone areas near surface ground water or other factors such as underground facilities or utilities  2 the design of the site precludes the use of soil amendments plantings of vegetation or other designs that can be used to infiltrate and evapotranspirate runoff  3 water harvesting and use are not practical or possible because the volume of water used for irrigation toilet flushing industrial makeup water washwaters or other is not significant enough to warrant the design and use of water harvesting and use systems  4 modifications to an existing building to manage stormwater are not feasible due to structural or plumbing constraints or other factors as identified by the facility owneroperator  5 small project sites where the lot is too small to accommodate infiltration practices adequately sized to infiltrate the volume of runoff from impervious surfaces  6 soils that cannot be sufficiently amended to provide for the requisite infiltration rates  7 situations where site use is inconsistent with the capture and use of stormwater or other physical conditions on site that preclude the use of plants for evapotranspiration or bioinfiltration  8 retention andor use of stormwater onsite or discharge of stormwater onsite via infiltration has a significant adverse effect on the site or the down gradient water balance of surface waters ground waters or receiving watershed ecological processes including areas that may exacerbate acid mine drainage or subsidence  9 state and local requirements or permit requirements that prohibit water collection or make it technically infeasible to use certain green
