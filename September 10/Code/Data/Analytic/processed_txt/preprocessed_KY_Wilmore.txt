channel  a perceptible watercourse with a definite bed and banks which confine and conduct the normal flowof water channel flow pertains to that water which is flowing within the limits of the defined channel flood  a temporary rise in stream flow that results in water overtopping its banks and inundating areas that areadjacent to the channel flood plain or flood hazard area  the channel and the land adjacent thereto which has been or may behereafter covered by flood water  including but not limited to the regulatory flood general flood plain district gfp  primarily includes the area defined as the flood plain or flood hazardarea  and with proper hydrologic studies may be further subdivided into a floodway and flood fringe as definedin the following floodway  the channel of a stream and those portions of the flood plain adjoining the channel that arerequired to carry and discharge the flood water within designated heights and velocities  including but notlimited to flood flows associated with the regulatory flood the floodway is intended to carry the deep and fastmoving flood water and the two principal factors in its determination are the selection of the flood dischargeand the permitted increase in flood heights flood fringe  the portion of the flood plain beyond the limits of the floodway flood waters in this area usuallyare shallow and slow moving a wider range of development filling buildings and other structures is permittedin this area provided that it is protected from the waters of the regulatory flood level this development ofcourse tends to reduce flood water storage capability and somewhat increases flood height but theseundesirable effects must be weighed against the economic losses to landowners and the community ifdevelopment is completely prohibited flood discharge  is the quantity of water flowing down a stream valley as a result of runoff from rainfall snowmelt or a combination of both the volume of water passing any point along a stream usually is measured incubic feet per second cfs gallons per minute gpm or million gallons per day mgd one cfs equals694 gpm   pm zoning document viewer onlineencodepluscomregswilmorekydocvieweraspx#secid5 871 flood frequency floods along a single stream are commonly compared in terms of their frequency ofoccurrence for example a flood may be referred to as a 50year frequency flood which means that it has aprobability of occurring once every fifty years or two percent probability of occurring in any one given year thisflood of course may actually occur only once in a 50year period or it may happen more or less frequentlyalthough flood discharge increases as the return period lengthens the discharge of a 100year flood is notsimply twice that of a 50year flood this is dependent upon the hydrologic characteristics of the watercourse flood profile  a graph of longitudinal profile showing the height of the flood discharge measured at pointsalong the watercourse generally in feet above mean sea level the profile elevations are used to determine theexact limits of the flood plain in the field to solve mapping disputes to specify floodproofing levels forconstruction and to determine the degree of nonconformity of existing structures there is a different floodprofile for every size of flood discharge even identical flood discharges occurring at different time periods onthe same watercourse can result in different flood profiles because of physical changes within the watershedsuch as vegetation growth or reduction addition of new structures etc flood proofing  a combination of structural provisions changes or adjustments to properties and structuressubject to flooding primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages

subject to periodicinundation resulting in damage to or loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption ofcommerce and governmental services public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment ofthe tax base all of these adversely affect the public health safety and welfare b general causes of periodic flooding the general cause of the periodic flooding and resulting losses are 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions within flood hazard areas which intensify flood height and velocity  2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by users vulnerable to flood damage or by uses hazardous to otherlands which are inadequately elevated or otherwise properly protected from flood damages  3 increased storm water runoff from upstream areas as a result of natural ground cover being replaced bybuildings streets parking lots  etc c flood hazard delineation the method used for reasonably analyzing and delineating the flood hazard areais described in and objectives the delineation of the flood hazard areas and the regulations applied thereto are intended to   pm zoning document viewer onlineencodepluscomregswilmorekydocvieweraspx#secid5 2971 a promote the public welfare by protecting human life and health and minimizing public and private propertydamage b provide for public awareness of the flooding potential and protect individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards c minimize pollution of surface and ground water which could affect human animal and plant life d control development which acting alone or in combination with similar development will create an unjustifieddemand for public investment in flood control improvements because uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities  were not protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  will create anadditional burden to pay the costs of any relief measures such as rescue pumping dikes storm sewers etc and will create an additional burden to the public in terms of business interruptions street closings utilityservice disruptions and other happenings which result in loss of safety wages

of thecity of wilmore or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on thisordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder  method of delineating

floodingbased upon evidence of past floods the information used as evidence of past flooding include soil surveymapping by the soil conservation service of the us department of agriculture united
