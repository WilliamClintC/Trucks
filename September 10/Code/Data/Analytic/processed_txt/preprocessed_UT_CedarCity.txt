sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material it is a purpose hereof to protect the citizenry from the detrimental secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities thus the city desires to make the owners of these establishments responsible for activities that occur on the premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in 23a 2 sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 1985  253448 in 1992  and 621329 as of  8 as of  there are 1467 reported cases of aids in the state of utah 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in utah 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the office of the surgeon general of the united states in a report dated  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 prohibiting doors or similar partitions on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 23a 3 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this ordinance 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this ordinance definitions adult arcade means any place to which the public is permitted or invited wherein coinoperated slugoperated or for any form of consideration or

adequately handle the storm water runoff generated in the city c the citys anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate storm drainage system d the city has constructed significant flood control improvements which need adequate maintenance in order to remain effective e uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm and flood waters cause erosion and property damage f uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm and flood waters hinder the citys ability to provide emergency services to its residents g uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city  h uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm and flood waters pose hazards to the citizens of the community i storm water runoff carries concentrations of oil grease nutrients chemicals heavy metals toxic materials and other undesirable materials that may jeopardize the integrity of ground waters receiving waters including the citys culinary water supply j all developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the storm drainage system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces k al developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the citys operation and maintenance of the storm drain andor flood control systems l inadequate drainage along existing streets due to the lack of adequate storm drain systems cause the street pavement to deteriorate and fail thus increasing street maintenance costs m absent effective maintenance operation regulation and control of existing storm water drainage and flood control systems in the city constitute a potential hazard to the health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and its businesses n a storm drain utility is the most
