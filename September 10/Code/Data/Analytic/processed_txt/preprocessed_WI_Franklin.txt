uncontrolled runoff has a significant impact upon water resources andthe health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and useof natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scourdiminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing streamtemperature  diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and watersupply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids

increasing pollutant loading  threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other drainage facilities  threaten public health safety property

restored or constructed wetlands one potential maintenance concern inrestored or constructed wetlands is clogging of the outlet restored or constructed wetlandsshould be designed with a nonclogging outlet such as a reverseslope pipe or a weir outlet with atrash rack a reverseslope pipe draws from below the micropool extending in a reverse angle upto the riser and establishes the water elevation of the micropool because these outlets drawwater from below the level of the micropool they are less likely to be clogged by floating debris restored or constructed wetlands should incorporate design features that make sedimentcleanouts of both the forebay and the shallow pool easier restored or constructed wetlandsshould have direct maintenance access to the forebay to allow this relatively routine five to sevenyear sediment cleanouts in addition the shallow pool should generally have a drain to drawdown the restored or constructed wetland for the more infrequent dredging of the main cell of therestored or constructed wetland in general the introduction of natural features in constructed wet detention basins will not onlyincrease pollutant removal capacity but also result in a new water body that can potentially cometo offer wildlife habitat values in order to help this process the wet detention ponds must bespecially designed to have the appropriate geometry location size and vegetation such facilitiesare called constructed wetlands and have been shown to be effective successful and reliable inthe long run because of their natural appearance water quality benefits and need for minimum maintenanceconstructed wetlands are preferred and should be encouraged whenever appropriate andorpossible however it should be noted that storm water wetlands are designed specifically for thepurpose of treating storm water runoff and typically have less biodiversity than natural wetlandsboth in terms of plant and animal life bioretention facilities bioretention areas are landscaping features adapted to treat storm water runoff on thedevelopment site they are commonly located in parking lot islands or within small pockets inresidential land uses surface runoff is directed into shallow landscaped depressions thesedepressions are designed to incorporate many of the pollutant removal mechanisms that operatein forested ecosystems runoff from larger storms is generally diverted past the facility to thestorm drain system or another bmp the remaining runoff filters prepared or amendedsoil mixture which acts as a pollutant removal system when underlying soils are not conducive toinfiltration the filtered runoff is collected in a perforated underdrain and sent to the storm drainsystem bioretention systems can be applied to a wide range of development bioretention can be
