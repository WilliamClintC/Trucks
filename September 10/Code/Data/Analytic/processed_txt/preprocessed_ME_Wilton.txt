the town of wilton  enacted  signed diane dunham town clerk mailbox policy for the municipality of wilton for convenience and practicality mailbox installations have been allowed within the rightofway of maines public highways  however it is important to recognize that such installations have two very important conditions 1 the mailbox must be installed in accordance with applicable standards to ensure that mail can be delivered and that the mailbox does not create an obstacle or safety hazard to those that use or maintain the highway and 2 the mailbox is installed entirely at the owners risk in other words if the mailbox incurs damage during any sort of highway operations or maintenance the property owner is not entitled to replacement or compensation in fact if the mailbox was not installed in accordance with the applicable standards as stated above the owner may even be held liable for injuries or damages that may have been incurred as a result mailbox design and installation standards are available from several sources and mailbox owners are expected to consult this information prior to undertaking any mailbox installation or replacement the following standards have nationwide relevance and were developed in cooperation with one another  the united states postal service usps mailbox guidelines the usps defines the standards for mailbox construction as well as the placement tolerance that must be met to accommodate postal operations specifics may be obtained from your local post office or online at  guidelineshtm  american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto roadside design guide the aashto roadside design guide erecting mailboxes on streets and highways deals with the safety and construction of privately owned mailboxes mailbox supports and mailbox turnout designs and is less focused on postal operations this publication may be obtained online aashto bookstore at  this municipality has developed this policy to promote compliance with these national standards and to help further clarify the expectations and responsibilities of maine mailbox owners to improve the safety of our roads the following pages further specify the details associated with the mailbox height location offset and post type to minimize the potential hazards associated with mailbox installations and to reduce the opportunities for damage to mailboxes mailbox installation standards general location whenever possible your mailbox should be located after your driveway opening this location placement improves visibility minimizes the amount of snow that comes off of the snow plow and improves the approach for your mail carrier the diagram below further clarifies this preferred placement mailbox support design it is best to use an extended arm type of post with a freeswinging suspended mailbox this allows snowplows to sweep near or under boxes without damage to supports and provides easy access to the boxes by carrier and customers the following picture shows a freeswinging suspended mailbox offset mailboxes should be set back from the edge of the shoulder  regardless of whether the shoulder is gravel or paved in other words the face of the mailbox should be at least one foot 1 back from the edge of the normally plowed surface of the highway or the face of curb greater offset distances are encouraged whenever possible to allow the mail carrier to get further out of traffic and to further minimize potential damage to your mailbox the following picture shows a mailbox with a reasonable offset height according to usps standards a mailbox must be installed with the bottom of the mailbox located between 41 and 45 high above the surface of the highway shoulder we recommend that this height be closer to the 45 measurement to minimize conflict with the height of the plow truck wing when snow is being pushed back during or between winter storms the following picture further clarifies the height considerations post size type and embedment mailbox posts must be sturdy enough to hold up the mailbox in all types of weather conditions however they cannot be so rugged that they present a hazard to vehicles that inadvertently leave the road if a mailbox support is struck by a vehicle it must easily break away therefore the following types of posts are deemed acceptable  4 x 4 wooden posts embedded 2 feet into the ground larger wooden posts may be used only if the post is drilled an appropriate spade bit to create a shear plane that is no higher than 6 above the surface of the surrounding ground the number and size of the drilled holes depends upon what is necessary to bring the cross section of the larger post down to the equivalent crosssectional area of a standard 4 x 4 post mainedot standard specification 60606  1 to 2 round diameter steel or aluminum pipe or standard uchannel post embedded 2 feet into the ground  unacceptable mailbox supports include anything that is filled with concrete masonry and stone structures heavy steel structures and most objects that were intended for other uses eg antique plows ibeams and various other household tools and objects notice mailboxes attachments or support systems not consistent with this policy are considered deadly fixed objects aka dfos and are in violation of 23 mrsa 1401 a on state and state aid roads on local roads they can be considered as obstructions and a number of statutes relate to these obstructions as such when these installations are recognized by the municipality the owner will be informed of the hazard and immediate removal will be requested if the property owner does not comply with this request the municipality may elect to remove the installation and seek reimbursement from the property owner for all costs incurred town of wilton parking and traffic ordinance title this ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the parking and traffic the town of wilton maine authority

potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation

within eighteen months of said damage destruction or removal in no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c2 above if any such structure is located within a floodplain along a river or other waterbody identified by the 100year floodplain as designated on the federal emergency management agencys fema flood insurance rate maps or flood hazard boundary maps such structure shall be reconstructed only in compliance with
