city of marysville ohio source materials used in the preparation of the the 1994 as supplemented ordinances subsequently adopted by the council the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof the absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 1994 use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this the reader can locate any section of the 1994 as supplemented and any subsequent ordinance included herein title system the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position page numbering system the page numbering system used in this a prefix system the letters to the left of the dash are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume the number to the right of the dash represents the number of the page in that portion in the case of a chapter of the the number to the left of the dash indicates the number of the title and chapter in the case of an appendix to the when applicable the letter immediately to the left of the dash

based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing  2 the person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense b when the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c 1 when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2 c1 of this

cause a certain result or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature b a person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact c a person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist d a person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the persons conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature a person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist e when the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element

committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be c no person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of an offense shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in violation of this section d it is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor abandoned the actors effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its commission under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of the actors criminal purpose e whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an offense an attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt an attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted in the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of orc ch 3734 that is not specifically classified an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree
