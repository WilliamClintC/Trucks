titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either

a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2c1 of this section does not

the legislative intent of the city of louisville to discourage the survival of nonconforming uses to prevent their enlargement or expansion and to prevent their establishment elsewhere in the same zoning district the purpose of this chapter is to provide for the continuation and termination of nonconforming uses structures and lots that do not conform to the existing zoning but which were legally in existence or operation prior to the enactment of this udo or amendments thereto 115202 establishment of legal nonconforming use status acontinuance the lawful use of any building or land existing at the effective date of this udo or amendments thereto may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this the continued right to a nonconforming use attaches to the land and not to the owner such continuance is subject to the terms set forth in this 1 certificate of nonconforming use required a presumption that any nonconforming use is illegal is hereby established the burden is on the landowner or land user to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a preexisting use was legal at the time it was established 2 certificate of nonconforming use the planning director is hereby authorized to issue certificates of nonconforming use upon submission of evidence which establishes a legal preexisting nonconforming use the planning director may require a landowner or land user to submit a site plan in conformity with this udo to demonstrate the extent of the requested nonconforming use as a condition of issuing a nonconforming use certificate a copy of each certificate of nonconforming use shall be filed in the office of the planning and development department bdistrict changes whenever the boundaries of a district are changed

nonconforming use to all owners of legal nonconforming use property the use of which does not conform to the provisions of the use zone in which the property is located cnonexistence of nonconforming status nonconforming use status will never have existed if the use was not a legal substantial use of the property at the time the ordinance or amendment became effective examples of the non existence of nonconforming status include the following 1 where mere contemplation of a use or the expenditure of less than ten 10 percent of total anticipated costs on preliminary work before a complete development permit application is submitted or where a project does not substantially proceed past the planning stages within six months of the issuance of a development permit 2 where multiple parcels are held in common ownership and a legal nonconforming use is established on one or more parcels the nonconformance will not extend to any parcel where the nonconforming use was not established 3 where a portion of an individual parcel is established as a legal nonconforming use the nonconformance will not extend to the remaining portion where it is physically separated by a road or natural barrier this provision shall not apply to lots within a nonconforming manufactured home park 4where a contemplated use is merely incidental or accessory to an established nonconforming use 115203 termination of a nonconforming status the right to a nonconforming use will terminate upon the following events avoluntary discontinuance or abandonment whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of six 6 months or more a presumption of abandonment of the nonconforming use shall be established and any further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this udo the individual or entity claiming the continuance of the nonconforming use then bears the burden of proving the use has been continuous by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is terminated all of the nonconforming buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole b where a nonconforming use is changed to a more conforming use the use shall not later be changed back to a less conforming use as determined by the planning commission c  determination of public nuisance if the planning commission or court of law finds that a particular nonconforming use constitutes an actual nuisance which immediately or directly affects public health safety morals or general welfare d

by the owner of such nonconforming lot 115204 nonconforming use applications a  change from nonconforming status to conforming status if the intended change in use is to a conforming use that is allowed in the district where the property is located and if the proposed use complies with all of the development standards of this udo applicable to that district the change to the nonconforming use may be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this udo is achieved the property may not revert to nonconforming status b  nonconforming use change a change from one nonconforming use to another shall require review and approval by the planning commission in accordance with the standards for review shall include whether the proposed modification of the use is a reasonable for the zoning district determined by evaluation of each of the following factors 1 whether the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations 2 whether these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot 3 whether the proposed use is sufficiently similar to the former use 4 whether the proposed use has no greater negative impact than the former use 5 whether the proposed use is equally or more appropriate  andor 6 whether the proposed use falls within the same category as another land use permitted or conditionally permitted in the zoning district 7 whether the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety c  if a modification to a nonconforming use is permitted the planning commission may 1impose any restrictions designed to mitigate the negative impacts of the modification to the nonconforming use 2define with precision exactly which uses on a multiuse property are nonconforming 115205 completion of nonconforming use plans and construction nothing contained in these regulations shall hinder the construction of a building or prohibit its use where construction has started before the effective date of these regulations provided that foundations have been put in place before the effective date of these regulations and provided further that such building shall be completed within two years from the date of passage of these regulations 115206 substandard lots and minimum setback requirements this only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it amultiple adjacent nonconforming prior to development of undeveloped legal nonconforming lots which adjoin and have continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots held under the same ownership and where no substantial nonconforming use has been made of the property such nonconforming lots shall be consolidated with other adjacent undeveloped lots to create conforming lots except where such combination would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed standards for variance from this requirement even where such use has been long contemplated shall consider whether a development permit has been issued whether construction has been started within a reasonable time or whether substantial expenditures of time effort or funds or significant changes in position have occurred bany legal nonconforming lot not meeting the requirements of subsection a above and being a lot of record or lot for which a land contract has been issued or any lot within an unrecorded allotment of which at least onehalf 12 of the lots are of record or have been sold on land contract prior to the effective date of these regulations may be used for a singlefamily dwelling irrespective of the area depth or width of such lot csetback requirements for proposed residential use when a legal nonconforming lot is proposed as the site for the erection of a single family dwelling in place of the specified dimensional requirements of the particular zoning district the following minimum requirements shall apply 1 minimum front yard depth  the minimum front yard depth may be modified in accordance with d 2 the width of the side yard of any such lot need not exceed ten 10 percent of the width of the lot  however in no instance shall the minimum dimensions of the side yards be less than five 5 feet 3 the depth of the rear yard need not exceed twenty 20 percent of the depth of the lot  however in no instance shall the minimum dimensions of the rear yard be less than twenty 20 feet 115207 maintenance restoration

nothing in this unified development prevent the reconstruction repairing rebuilding and continued use of any legal nonconforming building or structure damaged by fire collapse explosion or acts of god subsequent to the date of this section as before such calamity provided such work does not exceed fifty 50 percent of the county auditors appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated such costs may be estimated by the property owners insurance carrier or a cost estimate prepared by a certified appraiser within the past two 2 years the cost of renovation repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this subsection by failing to provide a reasonable valuation for labor or by doing such work incrementally over a lengthy period cunsafe structures nothing in this unified development prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by a proper authority where appropriate a building permit for such activities shall be required 115208 extension of nonconforming uses a  displacement a nonconforming use shall not be physically expanded or extended to displace a conforming use b   expansions extensions or enlargements 1expansions or extensions of nonconforming uses shall be limited to fiftyone 51 percent of the lot coverage of the structure or use at the time it became a legal nonconforming use an exception may be allowed by the board of zoning appeals when the nonconformity advances a reasonable public purpose for example a legal nonconforming restaurant may be expanded or extended when it is in the public interest to allow the facility to be enlarged to install public restrooms 2if a structure is nonconforming due to a yard setback or height requirement the structure may be expanded or extended provided it does not increase the nonconformity of the previously established setback requirement for example if a structure is nonconforming due to a front yard setback the structure may be enlarged only to the extent that the previously established front yard setback is not further reduced 115209 substitution of nonconforming uses achange to another nonconforming use a nonconforming use may be changed to or replaced by another nonconforming use provided that the proposed nonconforming use is equally appropriate or in less conflict with character and use of the district than the existing nonconforming use as determined by the planning commission brelocation should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved chapter 1153 permitted and conditional uses

requirements of cprohibited land uses when a particular land use listed in does not indicate the letter p or c the specified use shall be considered prohibited until by amendment such uses are written into this zoning when the letter x is used in connection with a particular land use it shall not only mean the land use is prohibited in that district but further indicates that the specified land uses may not be interpreted as similar to any other permitted or conditional land use in that district dinterpretation determination of whether or not a use is specifically permitted or conditionally permitted by virtue of being similar in character to a specified permitted or conditionally permitted use in the district shall be made by the zoning inspector based on the purpose of the district regulations and this unified development 1the presumption established by this chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are located within at least one zoning district in the citys planning jurisdiction therefore because the list of land uses set forth in the land use matrix cannot be allinclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses 2the land use matrix shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is located on land in other zoning districts 3mixed uses whenever a mixeduse development could fall within more than one use classification in the land use matrix the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development as determined by the planning commission controls when a mixed use development comprises two 2 or more principal uses where any of the principal uses is a conditional use then a conditional zoning certificate for the entire mixeduse development must be obtained as authorized by the planning commission eoverlay districts all uses that are normally permitted in the underlying zoning district shall also be permitted in an overlay district unless specified otherwise 115302 matrix of permitted and conditional land uses  land use district fp a1 r1

defined herein a goal of these access management standards is to limit and reduce the number of driveways in favor of combined driveways and the construction of service roads to handle access to multiple parcels for every new or converted multifamily dwelling rooming house commercial building or industrial use the following standards shall apply for the design of ingress egress or accessways a number of driveways each lot is permitted to have a single twoway driveway except in cases where a traffic impact study clearly demonstrates the benefits of a second driveway from the standpoint of traffic movement examples of where a second drive may be justified include large corner lots where driveways on both streets may be desirable and instances where two one way drives are preferred more

commission 115901 purpose parks recreational amenities and public open spaces are generally considered an important part of a healthy community adding to the cultural fabric and quality of life in society and the community therefore the public health safety and welfare require that as the population of the city increases and changes demographically more parks and recreational amenities are needed these amenities provide a more desirable living environment for the residents of new developments and reduce the demand for comparable amenities developed or acquired at public expense with respect to such residential subdivision developments property shall be devoted andor developed for parks public open spaces and recreational amenities by or at the expense of developers the acquisition and development of such parks public open spaces and recreational amenities are necessary to meet the needs of future residents and shall be provided in substantial part by such future residents developed open space shall be designed to provide active recreational facilities to serve the residents of the development undeveloped open space shall be designed to preserve important site amenities scenic vistas and environmentally sensitive areas 115902 parks and recreation plan the city of louisvilles community plan provides a direction for the acquisition and development of parks public open spaces and recreational amenities the planning commission shall give primary consideration to this document in determining the requirements placed on any proposed subdivision if any portion of any lot proposed for residential development lies within a general area designated on the officially adopted community development plan as a general local for a neighborhood park or as a general area for a greenway system or bikeway system consideration shall be given to implementation of such plans requirement of this when parks open space and recreational amenities are required the planning commission shall require the dedication of land parks playgrounds open space andor school sites as specified in this where the adopted community development plans shows the planned location of such public sites the planning commission shall require dedication in conformance with such plans 115904 options and requirements the planning commission shall require the dedication of land parks playgrounds open space andor school sites as specified in accordance with this the adopted community development plans shows the planned location of such public sites the planning commission shall require dedication in conformance with such plans all proposals submitted thirty 30 days or more after the effective date of this unified development or after the adoption of the community plan shall be required to either a dedicate a portion of the proposed development for recreational purposes  b pay a fee in lieu of land dedication  or c dedicate a portion of land and pay a fee in lieu the planning commission shall determine the appropriate option and seek the consent of the parks and recreation board 115905 determination of requirements during the preliminary discussion phase the developer should gain information concerning requirements of the planning commission regarding dedication of land fee in lieu of payments or a combination of both the basis of the following minimum regulations a if the developer proposes to dedicate land for parks recreation and open spaces such land proposed to be dedicated shall be indicated on the preliminary development plan b if the developer proposes to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication such information shall be submitted to the planning commission as part of the preliminary development plan c the planning commission shall review the proposal of the developer concerning either dedication of land payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication or both the criteria used to determine whether the developer shall dedicate land pay a fee in lieu of land dedication or both shall be as follows 1 the planning commission decision shall attempt to facilitate the objectives outlined in the community plan 2 the planning commission shall also consider the advice of various recommendations from members of the planning director director of parks and recreation and the city manager 3 on the basis of the review of a proposal the planning commission shall determine whether a dedication of land a payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication or a combination of both shall be required 4 if the developer opts to only partially fulfill the requirements of this the dedication of park land open space andor recreational amenities and the planning commission approves such action the minimum fee requirements applicable to such development shall be reduced by a proportionate percentage amount determined by comparing the actual amount of land dedicated as public land to the total land dedication requirement 115906 determination of required land dedication or fees the total population of any development shall be determined by a summation of all population factors for each proposed dwelling unit in the subdivision development or lot split the population factor for each dwelling shall be as follows  dwelling type population factor singlefamily 36 per unit two family multifamily 26 per unit total population shall be determined by multiplying the population per unit by the total number of units proposed the planning commission may permit minor deviations from open space standards when it determines that the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  andor because of peculiarities in the tract of land or facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards the planning commission may modify the requirements of this the developer can show to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the development will house a population per household substantially lower than those established in this or that there are special characteristics of the development which justify modification of the requirements can be reasonably expected to continue for the life of the project the amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider builder or developer shall be determined in accordance with the following formula acres of land for dedication   total population x 01 if the amount of land required for dedication is less than three acres and that area could not be added to an adjoining continuous existing park open space or recreational area no such dedication of land shall be deemed acceptable by the planning commission in this situation the requirements shall be fulfilled only by payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication 115907 park classifications to provide an appropriate mix of recreation facilities that fulfill community needs and are responsive to community conditions the following park classifications are established for varying scales of dedicated properties a pocket parks  an area between two thousand five hundred 2500 square feet and one 1 acre in size should be used to address limited isolated or unique recreations needs such as a landscaped public use area in a commercial area a play area adjacent to the downtown shopping district picnic areas arbors and sitting areas such parks are typically located less than onequarter 025 mile from a residential setting accessibility by way of interconnecting trails sidewalks or lowvolume residential streets increases use opportunities and is therefore strongly encouraged b neighborhood parks  an area of five 5 to ten 10 acres which serves as the recreational and social focus of a neighborhood should typically be designed to include play structures and informal nonprogrammed playfield or open space these parks are typically located onequarter 025 to one half  mile from a residential setting uninterrupted by nonresidential roads and other physical barriers such parks should be accessible throughout its service area by way of interconnecting trails sidewalks or lowvolume residential streets and ideally should be connected to other park system components such parks should also exhibit some innate aesthetic qualities appropriate for both active and passive recreational uses leftover parcels of land that are undesirable for development should be avoided as they are generally undesirable for park development as well c community park  an area usually between thirty 30 and ninety 90 acres should be used to meet broader purposes than neighborhood parks focusing on communitybased recreation needs and heavily programmed athletic fields and associated facilities as well as preserving unique landscapes and open spaces such parks are typically located onehalf  mile to three 3 miles from a residential setting or neighborhood d park connector greenway system  multipurpose trails located within greenways parks and natural resource areas that enable focus on the natural environment or enable safe pedestrian bicycle or equestrian travel to and from parks and around the community 115908 park design and function an area designated as required open space in residential subdivisions and mixed use developments may be a incorporated as a part of the park and open space system of the city  b preserved in its natural state  c utilized as a buffer area to separate a development from surrounding properties  d leased and utilized for agricultural use excluding all livestock with the exception of use as a grazing pasture for horses or cattle when authorized in a conservation easement or in an associations covenants and restrictions  e utilized in part as wet or dry stormwater management ponds or basins provided that easements are provided to enable the maintenance of these facilities and that such features are designed to be a recreational amenity fused as an active recreation areas these active recreation areas shall be located in areas with the least impact on natural amenities and wildlife habitats of a useable size and shape for the intended purpose park design and function requirements include the following a access land that is to be designated as required open space shall be designed as connected andor contiguous open space system and all adjacent residential properties shall have access to this open space for the use andor enjoyment of residents or general public of the proposed development public maintenance and emergency access shall be provided by direct frontage of the dedicated land on a public street such frontage shall be of sufficient width to allow for maintenance and emergency vehicle access or an easement of sufficient width to allow such access shall be provided the planning commission shall determine adequacy based on site and project design characteristics the area shall be at least twenty 20 feet from all first story dwelling unit windows as a part of the park and open space system of the city  b preservation of natural beauty natural features of scenic beauty which if preserved will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated land shall be preserved in the dedication of open space and parks and recreation areas and should be given primary focus and consideration in site design if the planning commission determines that a proposed parcel of dedicated land is of unique natural beauty or of environmental or historical value the requirements regarding shape topography or grade may be waived site characteristics of natural significance which may offer aesthetic or ecological value for example a riparian corridor stands of old trees or wetlands may substitute for traditional usable open space  the application of this guideline is subject to the judgment of the planning commission c topography steep slopes streams lakes other watercourses and flood plains may constitute a maximum of thirty 30 percent of the dedicated land and a minimum of seventy 70 percent of the land required for dedication shall be suitable for dry ground recreational use slopes over fifteen percent 15% may account for only ten percent 10% of usable open space requirements d grade seventy 70 percent of the land suitable for dry ground recreational use shall not exceed three 3 percent grade and the remaining dryground shall not exceed five 5 percent grade e unity dedicated land must form a single parcel unless the planning commission determines that it would be in the best public interest for the dedication to consist of a few large pieces connected by a trail path or walkway every attempt should be made to match open spaces andor recreational land with similar land on adjoining lots or subdivisions and existing parkland or open space f composition utility drainage or other easements that are typically required as part of a development shall not count toward the provision of open space g water body surfaces up to twenty 20 percent of detention or retention ponds may substitute for usable open space and up to sixty 60 percent of natural ponds may substitute the planning commission has the ability to determine that retention basins may account for more than twenty 20 percent if the basin design potentially offers some recreational utility 115909 ownership requirements the type of ownership of land dedicated or provided for parkland open space or recreational purposes shall be selected by the developer subject to the approval of the planning commission type of ownership may include but is not limited to the following a a legally established homeowners association  b the city of louisville subject to acceptance by the city council  c public jurisdictions or agencies subject to their acceptance  d quasipublic organizations subject to their acceptance  or subject to permanent restrictions as set forth herein required open space may be owned by an association the city a land trust or other conservation organization recognized by the city of louisville or by a similar entity required open space may be held by the individual members of a condominium association as tenantsincommon or may be held in common ownership by a homeowners association community association or other similar legal entity the citys law director shall review and approve all relevant documents pertaining to the ownership of parkland and open space 115910 etermination of fees in lieu of land dedication if the planning commission determines that a developer must pay a fee in lieu of land dedication and there is more than one 1 lot involved then the amount of such fee shall be determined by the following formula fee in lieu of land dedication   amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicatedx fair market value per acre for purposes of this fair market value shall be determined as of the time of the final development plat using the county auditors determination of market value used for real estate taxation purposes alternative methods of determination of fair marker value may also be proposed and accepted 115911 adjustments to standards permitted by planning commission the requirements set forth in this the amount size location and nature of parks public open space and recreational amenities to be provided in connection with subdivisions and developments are established by city council as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational amenities anor open space that is consistent with officially adopted community development plans notwithstanding any provision of these regulations to the contrary the planning commission may in cases of an unusual or exceptional nature the underlying objectives of this be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision and may allow for adjustments in the park land dedication and feein lieu

as follows abioretention basin storm water wetland  a constructed system that is explicitly designed to mitigate the impacts of storm water quality and quantity that occur during the process of urbanization it does so by temporarily storing storm water runoff in shallow pools that create growing conditions suitable for emergent and riparian wetland plants the runoff storage complex microtopography and emergent plants in the basin together form an ideal matrix for the removal of urban pollutants bioretention basins usually fall into one of the five basic designs listed below 1shallow marsh system  the shallow marsh design has a large surface area and requires a reliable source of baseflow or groundwater supply to maintain the desired water elevations to support emergent wetland plants consequently the shallow marsh system requires a lot of space and a sizeable contributing watershed area often in excess of 25 acres to support the shallow permanent pool 2pondwetland system  the pondwetland design utilizes two separate cells for stormwater treatment the first cell is a wet pond and the second cell is a shallow marsh the multiple functions of the wet pond are to trap sediments reduce incoming runoff velocity and to remove pollutants the pond wetland system consumes less space than the shallow marsh because the bulk of the treatment is provided by the deeper pool rather than the shallow marsh 3extended detention wetland  in extended detention ed wetlands extra runoff storage is created above the shallow marsh by temporary detention of runoff the ed feature enables the wetland to consume less space as temporary vertical storage is partially substituted for shallow marsh storage a new growing zone is created along the gentle sideslopes of ed wetlands that extend from the normal pool elevation to the maximum ed water surface elevation 4pocket wetlands  pocket wetlands are adapted to serve smaller sites from one to ten acres in size because of their small drainage areas pocket wetlands usually do not have a reliable source of baseflow and therefore exhibit widely fluctuating water levels in most cases water levels in the wetland are supported by excavating down to the water table in drier areas the pocket wetland is supported only by storm water runoff and during extended periods of dry weather will not have a shallow pool at all only saturated soils due to their small size and fluctuating water levels pocket wetlands often have low plant diversity and poor wildlife habitat value 5fringe wetlands  fringe wetlands are formed by shallow aquatic benches installed along the perimeter of the permanent pool of a wet pond these benches are normally 10 to 15 feet in width on both sides of the normal pool although they can be extended in width fringe wetlands are a very useful design feature in ponds as they promote a more natural appearance conceal trash and changes in water levels reduce safety hazards and provide some aquatic habitat while fringe wetlands are a desirable feature in wet points they provide only a minor increment of additional pollutant removal bdesign year  the frequency with which a storm of a specific intensity and duration will be experienced over time therefore it signifies the probability of a storm with a specific intensity occurring within one year probability   1design year example 125 year   4% probability of occurring every year typical design year events are the 1 2 5 10 25 50 and 100year storms cdetention basin  a storm water facility whose purpose is to detain storm water from a specific drainage area prior to discharging to a downstream channel for the purpose of these requirements a detention basin will be considered to be dry prior to a rain event ddevelopment  a manmade change to any improved or unimproved real estate not including singlefamily residential homes up to 4000 square feet in floor plan including garages and associated driveways and sidewalks edrainage outlet  any location where storm water runoff leaves the proposed development site the outlet typically is a ditch stream storm sewer or approved basin fmajor flood path  a system that conveys and temporarily stores runoff from rarer storms such as the 25year events the major flood path is utilized whenever the capacities of the street gutters storm sewers and inlets are exceeded the major flood path components can consist of the following 1streets 2swales 3detentionretention basins  multipurpose 4manmade channels  open and closed 5natural creeks streams and rivers gretention

ecologicallyfriendly approach to site development and storm water management that aims to mitigate development impacts to land water and air the approach emphasizes the integration of site design and planning techniques that conserve natural systems and hydrologic functions on a site the goals of low impact development include a incorporating natural topographic features wetlands stream corridors mature forests and constraints in site design  b maintaining site hydrologic functions and mitigate impacts to such functions  c providing alternative layout and sizing of traditional site  d maintaining the total number of buildable lots within a development lot yield  e customizing infrastructure lots streets curbs gutters sidewalks to each site  f decentralizing and micromanagement stormwater at its source  and g providing aesthetically pleasing stormwater management controls 116502 waiving of requirements to encourage the use of low impact development techniques the planning commission is empowered to waive or otherwise modify other requirements as set forth in or to the extent necessary to provide for and encourage the use of low impact development techniques as described in this any waiver in site requirements for low impact development standards shall in no way be construed as a waiver of all requirements of the aforementioned chapters 116503 low impact development standards the following site design elements should be considered in low impact development a reduce limits of clearing and grading the limits of clearing and grading refer to the site area to which development is directed this development area includes all impervious areas roads sidewalks and rooftops and pervious areas graded lawn areas and open drainage systems 1to minimize hydrologic impacts on the existing site the land cover area of development should be located ain less sensitive areas or areas with lower value in terms of hydrologic function eg developing barren clay soils will have less hydrologic impact than development of forested sandy soils boutside of sensitive area buffers such as streams floodways floodplains wetlands and steep slopes coutside of areas with soils which have high infiltration rates to reduce net hydrologic site impacts 2minimum disturbance techniques may be employed to further reduce the limits of clearing and grading by restricting ground disturbance by identifying the smallest possible area and clearly delineating it on the site these techniques include areduce paving and compaction of highly permeable soils  bminimizing the size of construction easements and material storage areas during the construction phase of a development  cavoid removal of existing trees where possible and specifically those trees over 18 inches in diameter  1minimizing imperviousness by reducing the total area of paved surfaces  2disconnecting as much impervious area as possible to increase opportunities for infiltration and reduce water runoff flow  3maintaining existing topography and associated drainage divides to encourage natural dispersed flow paths b drainage as a design element to reduce impacts created by land development site planning should incorporate drainage by carefully conducting hydrologic evaluations and reviewing spatial site layout options these procedures should be incorporated into the site planning process early on to understand and take advantage of site conditions hydrologic evaluation procedures can be used to minimize runoff potential and to maintain the predevelopment time of concentration open drainage systems for example should be designed within natural landforms and land uses to become major design elements and amenities of a site plan or development plan the stormwater management drainage system can suggest pathway alignment optimum locations for open space and potential building sites the drainage system helps to integrate urban forms giving the development an integral more aesthetically pleasing relationship to the natural features of the site c minimize impervious surfaces the entire traffic distribution network roadways sidewalks driveways and parking areas are the greatest source of impervious area changes in the impervious area alter runoff recharge values and site hydrology managing the imperviousness contributed by road and parking area pavement is an important component of the site planning and design process an appropriate strategy may avoid problems from runoff and water table depletion by reducing such surfaces that prevent natural filtration methods that can be used to achieve a reduction in the total runoff volume from impervious surfaces are presented below 1narrow road sections reduced width road sections can be used to reduce total site imperviousness as well as clearing and grading impacts by using a more rural road section the width of the street surface may be reduced a more rural design also eliminates the use of concrete curb and gutter and allows for vegetated roadside swales 2reduced application of sidewalks to one side of primary roads total site imperviousness can also be reduced by limiting sidewalks to one side of primary roads 3reduced onstreet parking reducing onstreet parking requirements to one side or even elimination of onstreet parking altogether has the potential to reduce road surfaces and therefore overall site imperviousness twosided parking requirements may be unnecessary to provide adequate parking facilities for each lot 4vegetative roof systems moss grass herbs wildflowers and native plants may be used to create a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing permeable vegetative surface on an impervious roof area 5driveways driveways are another element of the site plan that can be planned to reduce the total site imperviousness some techniques that can be used include ausing shared driveways whenever possible but especially in sensitive areas blimiting driveway width for both single and shared driveways cminimizing building setbacks to reduce driveway length dusing driveway and parking area materials which reduce runoff and increase travel times such as pervious pavers or gravel 6permeable pavement surfaces a variety of materials ranging from traditional asphalt and concrete gravel or pavers may be used to construct these surfaces these roadways or parking areas must allow water to flow replenishing the soil areas directly beneath the subbase underneath these permeable pavements must be engineered to accommodate temporary water storage and filtration 7minimize directly connected impervious areas additional environmental benefits can be achieved and hydrologic impacts reduced by disconnecting unavoidable impervious areas strategies for accomplishing this include adisconnecting roof drains and directing flows to vegetated detention areas bdirecting flows from impervious paved areas to stabilized vegetated areas cbreaking up flow directions from large paved surfaces dencouraging sheet flow areas ecarefully locating impervious areas so that they drain to natural systems vegetated buffers natural resource areas or infiltratable soils 8modify drainage flow paths the time of concentration in conjunction with hydrologic site conditions determines the peak discharge rate for a storm event site and infrastructure components such as travel distance flow path  slope of the ground surface andor water surface  surface roughness  and channel shape pattern and material components can affect the time of concentration techniques that can affect and control the time of concentration can be incorporated into site design by managing flow and conveyance systems within the development site a maximize overland sheet flow  b increase and lengthen flow paths  c lengthen and flatten site and lot slopes  d maximize use of open swale systems  e increase and augment site and lot vegetation 9 in order to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and decentralize flows a basic strategy incorporating the following low impact development practices and techniques should be integrated in the overall site design a open swales these may serve as alternatives to curb and gutter systems grass or other vegetation should be used to reduce runoff velocity and allow filtration while channeling high volume flows safely away 1plantings checkdams and other similar features may be incorporated to further reduce velocity and increase filtration  2walkways shall be separated from roadways by such swales or relocated to another area  3plant species used shall be selected for their tolerance to salt b rain gardens these areas provide storage for excess storm water to collect and filter into the soil typical components of these gardens include grass buffers sand beds a ponding area for excess runoff storage organic layers and planting soil and vegetation 1they shall be located on site away from any structures andor roadways  2downspouts should be directed towards such rain gardens  3permanent ponds may be incorporated into the design of the garden  4temporary storage areas without ponds may be used  5such areas shall be landscaped with native plants and grasses  6plantings shall be selected according to their ability to tolerate pollutants  7annual maintenance guarantees must be provided for these areas in the site plan or development plan c filter strips these areas are designed to collect flow from large impervious surfaces such as parking lots they may direct water into vegetated detention areas or special sand filters that capture pollutants and gradually discharge the water d cisternsrain barrels cisterns are designed to store stormwater for irrigation during dry periods rather than channeling it away cistern collection systems may be designed to be installed beneath permeable pavement areas allowing for maximum storage capacity rain barrels are smaller and often designed to collect roof
