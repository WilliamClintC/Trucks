requirements of subsections 302310b3 and 4 do not apply to stormwater management facilities that are dedicated to and accepted by the municipality or another governmental agency 10 in the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health or if it is in need of maintenance or repair the municipality shall so notify the responsible person in writing upon receipt of that notice the responsible person shall have 14 days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in a manner that is approved by the municipal engineer or his designee the municipality in its discretion may extend the time allowed for effecting maintenance for good cause if the responsible person fails or refuses to perform such maintenance and repair the municipality or county may immediately proceed to do so and shall bill the cost thereof to the responsible person c nothing in this subsection shall preclude the municipality in which the major development is located from requiring the posting of a performance or maintenance guarantee in accordance with njsa d53  302310 englewood  30241 ao472 among other things that the public use provision of the united states constitution should be broadly interpreted to effectuate legislative judgments as to what particular needs justify the use of the power of eminent domain the result in kalo as a plurality decision reflecting the courts deep division on the question presented namely whether private residential real property may be the subject of eminent domain in order to satisfy a public purpose such as a planned development the result of the kalo decision was that where there existed a comprehensive plan of development that is deemed to satisfy the public purpose provision of the constitution even though the motivation for the plan might be economic development municipalities could use the eminent domain power to achieve the desired end as long as all parties legal rights were established in the process the kalo majority opinion specifically emphasized that nothing in the decision should preclude a state from placing further restrictions on the takings power one of the issues faced by the court was the appropriate line between public and private property use under the settled law of the state of new jersey the limitless sovereign power of the state may be employed to take real property as may be required for public safety necessity convenience or welfare so long as just compensation is paid the owner but it is for the legislative branch of government to determine what constitutes a public use to limit that broad power with the result that the power is to be used in a reasonable nonarbitrary manner and not greater than necessary to effectuate the public use the borough of englewood cliffs believes that one of the primary purposes of government is to protect the rights of owners or occupants of residential real properties and commercial properties within the borough against governmental takings that do not have as their goal either a the transfer of private property to public ownership for the creation of for example a road hospital military base or public housing or b the transfer of private property to private owners for the specific purpose of making the same available for public use eg railroad public utility stadium or public housing  30242 use of eminent domain #200610  2   the borough shall not employ the power of eminent domain so as to deprive owneroccupiers of residential real properties and commercial properties of such ownership rights in the absence of a specified purpose a to transfer the property to public ownership for the creation of a public use including but not limited to a road hospital military base public housing sewer water line sidewalk rightofway flood control park open space erosion control mechanism and the like  or b to transfer the property to private  30241 adopting ordinance  30242 ao473 owners for
