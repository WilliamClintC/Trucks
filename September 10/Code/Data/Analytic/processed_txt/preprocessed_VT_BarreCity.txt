renewable energy structures under separate criteria with additional flood hazard area variance standards variances to allow uses that are not permitted in the applicable district are not permissible 4469 b purpose the purpose of a variance is to address a hardship related to the physical characteristics of a particular lot which hampers the owner from enjoying the same property rights accorded to others in the flood hazard area district an applicant cannot request rights which have not been accorded to all others in the same district therefore in no case shall the drb grant a variance for a use which is not permitted in the flood hazard area district because a variance results in a deviation from the city plan and regulations variances are allowed only in narrow circumstances 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 c application and procedure variances are treated as appeals 4465 4466 therefore an application for a variance shall follow the procedures established in 301bg 23 24 25 d variance

narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the flood hazard area regulation in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located  and b that because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the flood hazard area regulation and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property  and c that the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant  and d that the variance if authorized will not alter the essential character flood hazard area regulations for the city of barre 2010  14  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located substantially or

structure in conformance with these regulations  and b that the hardship was not created by the appellant  and c that the variance if authorized will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property reduce access to renewable resources nor be a detriment to the public welfare  and d that the variance if authorized will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the flood hazard area regulations and from the city plan 3 flood hazard area for any structure in flood hazard area the drb may render a decision in favor of the applicant only upon establishing all of the facts identified in subsection 1 or 2 above as applicable and the following facts in its decision 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 a for projects within the regulatory floodway that during the base flood discharge the variance will not result in increased flood levels b for parcels of onehalf acre or less in size which are also contiguous to and surrounded by parcels with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation the following variance standards apply i demonstration of good and sufficient cause  ii determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  iii determination that the granting the variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimize the public or conflict with other local ordinances  and iv that the variance if approved is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief c while the granting of variances is generally limited to a parcel size of less than onehalf acre in size see subsection b above deviations from that limit may occur however as the parcel size increases flood hazard area regulations for the city of barre 2010  15  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 beyond onehalf acre the technical justification for issuing a variance increases

nonsubstantial improvements where the improvements only relate to these regulations for substantial improvement calculations a for example a nonsubstantial renovation of a third floor kitchen in the flood hazard area requires a permit but will not require a certificate of flood hazard compliance because the kitchen improvements are tracked only as a measure of substantial improvement of the entire structure on the other hand a nonsubstantial renovation of a garage with the floor below bfe will require but the permit and certificate of compliance because the garage renovations are material to the flood hazard regulations b the administrative officer shall determine at the time of issuance of the permit whether a certificate of flood hazard compliance will be required s posting

reviewed for conformance with these regulations 2 nonsubstantial improvements to existing structures apply to existing structures on their existing footprints additions to structures must be compliant with all relevant requirements of these regulations e the term substantial improvement does not include the following 1 the cost of improvements of a structure to correct existing violations of state and local health sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions  2 any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure the administrative officer may request from the applicant a report prepared by a qualified professional to demonstrate compliance with this provision a this exemption does not apply to additions ie expansions of building footprint to historic structures
