harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance  c the city of mill valley has made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking laws despite these efforts alcohol use by youth remains a serious problem in the city contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime addiction sexual assault truancy driving under the influence and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol andor controlled substances and causing injury andor death  d underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to possession by andor consumption of alcohol by underage persons persons responsible for the occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances are not served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings  e residents have failed to prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of loud or unruly gatherings including those where alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances are served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons on private property which seriously disrupts neighboring residents quiet enjoyment of their property  f control of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is necessary when such activity is determined to be a public nuisance  g persons held responsible for abetting or allowing loud or unruly gatherings where alcohol andor controlled substances are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their possession or under their control  h in the past and present law enforcement fire and other emergency response services personnel have responded and are required to respond sometimes on multiple occasions to loud or unruly gatherings on private property at which alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the city which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents and also result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city  i problems associated with loud or unruly gatherings at which alcoholic beverages andor controlled substances are served to

findings the city council of the city of mill valley does hereby determine that the streets of the city are particularly vulnerable to damage caused by heavily laden vehicles traveling to and from construction sites within the city for the following reasons among others a heavily laden vehicles delivering construction materials to construction sites repeatedly drive over the edge of the street paving onto unimproved property causing breakdowns of the paved shoulders of the streets b construction activities frequently involve excavation of city streets for purposes of installing various utility services such excavations render streets particularly vulnerable to damage from heavily laden vehicles  security for repair of city streets the city engineer is hereby authorized to require security in an amount to be established from time to time by city council resolution for the repair of damage to city streets which may occur as the result of use by vehicles traveling to and from construction sites within the city such security shall be in the form of cash a corporate surety bond or in such other form as may be approved by the city engineer for any construction project involving the issuance of a building permit indicating a construction cost in excess of $2500000 or for any other construction project where the city engineer has reasonable cause to believe that vehicles will be used which have a gross weight on any one axle in excess of 3000 pounds such security shall be posted prior to commencement of construction by the owner or lessee of the construction site or by such other person or entity for whose benefit such construction is undertaken upon the completion of any such construction work and after giving reasonable notice and opportunity to be

of black letters on a white background shall be at least two feet by four feet in size and shall be approved by the city engineer  newsracks  purpose and intent the city council finds that newsracks placed on public sidewalks streets and rightsofway can interfere with the use and attractive appearance of such public sidewalks streets and rightsofway thereby threatening the health safety and

that access to the use of these areas for such purpose is not to be denied except where such use unreasonably interferes with the use of these areas by pedestrians or traffic or whether such use

date of the local building code requiring earthquake resistant design of buildings of secondary benefit is the reduction of property damage such buildings have been widely recognized for sustaining lifehazardous damage during moderate to strong earthquakes the provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings this chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical plumbing mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or property it is also the citys intent enactment of this chapter to have appropriate city staff work closely with building owners and tenants to minimize economic hardships or interruption of business during the process of bringing buildings into compliance with the provisions of this chapter this chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for the identification and classification of unreinforced masonry buildings based upon their present use priorities time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and strengthened where the analysis finds deficiencies this chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished  scope the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings constructed or under construction prior to 1949 adoption date of the first local earthquake resistant code requirements or

of this or to matters for which an appeal is provided pursuant to a    former ordinances all former ordinances or parts thereof conflicting or inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or the adopted are hereby repealed   wildlandurban interface  justification the city council recognizes that the city of mill valley has within its borders and along its boundaries significant areas of grass brush and heavily forested lands these hazardous conditions present an exceptional and continuing fire danger to the residents of the community due to the difficulty of the terrain and topography of the area much of it consisting of boxed canyons with steep brushcovered slopes  narrow winding streets used by residents of the area and the fire department for ingress and egress  steep hills which hinder fire department response time  older and inadequate water systems in certain areas of the community  and the location of buildings and structures with relation to these dangerous areas the city council also recognizes that a great number of structures located within the city of mill valley were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s thus lacking the builtin protection of modern construction many of the residential structures had been built on steep slopes with boxed canyons and large percentages are located in areas of heavy natural growth many structures new and old are constructed of highly combustible material which offer little resistance to fire and could contribute to the spread of fire the city council also recognizes the fact that the community has been plagued many times in the late 1800s and early 1900s by brush and forest fires which not only threaten destruction but on a number of occasions devastated large portions of the town the desire of the community to preserve natural vegetation has resulted in the encroachment of brush and grass on fire roads trails breaks and streets within the city thus rendering such separations ineffective against the spread of fires natural growth which is highly flammable during the drier months of the year encroaches upon many properties thus posing a potential fire threat to many structures and creating a substantial hindrance to the control of such fires the city council recognizes that in the event that the fire department is called to respond to a fire emergency in any of these areas its response time to an emergency is increased by reason of the difficulties herein stated in recognition thereof and acting pursuant to california health and safety 5 and 179587 the city council finds that the fire protection requirements of this ordinance as such requirements modify state required regulations adopted pursuant to the california health and safety are hereby reasonably necessary because of local climatic geological and topographical conditions  adoption of the international urbanwildland interface certain document one copy of which is on file in the office of the fire marshal of the city of mill

of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of mill valley does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations    findings of fact a mill valley tidelands shorelines waterways beaches mudflats and salt marshes are vital natural resources which provide great benefits to present and future human generations in addition to assisting the process of converting carbon dioxide to oxygen they are essential features of the environment which not only provide food chains and serve as habitat for marine and bird life but are also because of the unique parttime exposure to air the only locations where certain fish eggs larvae and other forms of life can develop they provide one of a few remaining examples of natural seasonal growth and plant succession in the bay area they provide protection against erosion during storm conditions and if left undisturbed a natural drainage system they fulfill an indispensable role in preserving our temperate climate and the air purity of the bay area they offer scenic views open space recreational opportunities such as fishing swimming boating walking picnicking nature study and facilities for water transportation but most important they function as a delicately balanced biological system the impact of manmade changes in one place is felt throughout the whole system and is not confined by property lines or other artificial boundaries these benefits could be destroyed or seriously diminished by uncontrolled or haphazard conduct which is inimical to the welfare of both present and future residents of mill valley therefore the tidelands shorelines waterways beaches mudflats and salt marshes together with all those areas designated elsewhere in this chapter must be subject to proper controls for the preservation of these lands in their natural state so that these benefits may endure b the flood hazard areas of mill valley are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property disruption of commerce and governmental services health and safety hazards extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare c these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood hazard areas causing increased flood heights and erosive velocities and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages d the regulatory flood area selected for this chapter is representative of major floods known to have occurred in mill valley and which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur in the future the chances of such flooding can be expected to occur with a one percent frequency in any one year    purpose it is therefore the intention of the city council and the purpose of this chapter to ensure the survival of these vital natural resources to protect and preserve essential elements of the environment to maintain these benefits with a minimum of physical disturbance to set forth the standards and procedures by which filling excavating mining and all other construction in the designated areas will be regulated and to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d minimize prolonged business interruptions e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions i restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities j require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction k control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage    definitions unless specifically defined in this section words or phrases

of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the following as may be applicable 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner

relationship of the proposed use to the general plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b a variance shall only be approved based on making all of the following findings 1 that there is evidence in the public record to the satisfaction of the city council of good and sufficient cause 2 that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined herein to the applicant 3 that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create a nuisance or cause fraud and victimization of the public as defined herein or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 4 that the proposed new construction substantial improvement andor other proposed new development is necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the applicable provisions of subsection a111 of this section are satisfied 5 that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 6 that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city determines will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter c the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter the city council shall require as a condition of approval to the granting of a variance that the property owner enter into a recorded agreement with the city before a development permit is issued providing that the property owner will defend indemnify and hold harmless the city from any claims actions damages or liabilities arising in any manner from the granting of the variance d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and that insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 2 construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property 3 a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the marin county recorder so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance    appeals appeals from any determination of the floodplain administrator pursuant to this chapter shall be made to the city council for purposes of this chapter any appeal of a determination of the floodplain administrator shall be considered in the same manner as a variance and subject to the applicable provisions of    warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from

relation to surrounding structures on adjoining properties and in relation to the public realm streets sidewalks open space etc 1 adjusted floor area as defined in  for a proposed project will be calculated as follows a the total gross floor area measured from the outside faces of the structural walls of all of the following will be totaled i all enclosed structures on the lot including but not limited to the main dwelling structure accessory structures residential second units and sheds that require a building permit enclosed patios terraces and balconies are included but basements exterior areas under roof eaves or other cantilevered overhangs and nonenclosed spaces eg balconies decks and porches or structures eg gazebos and carports are not included a space is considered nonenclosed if it is substantially open on at least two sides sides with guardrails are considered open ii all enclosed but undeveloped volumes which could be utilized in the future as floor area and have minimum dimensions of eight feet by 10 feet and seven feet headroom without additional excavation all space horizontally contiguous to this minimum space which maintains at least a width of eight feet and seven feet head room without additional excavation will be included b the following will be subtracted from the paragraph a1a total above i for lots of up to 8000 square feet of gross area up

c a 50% premium floor area multiplied by 15 will be added for floor area in interior spaces that has a height over 14 feet wherever the 14foot height measurement is exceeded the height will be measured as follows i on a top floor as defined in  wherever the slope of the roof is less than a ratio of four feet of rise to 12 feet of run the height measurement shall be the vertical distance from the finished floor to the roof surface as defined in  ii on a top floor wherever the slope of the roof is equal to or greater than a ratio of four feet of rise to 12 feet of run the height measurement shall be the vertical distance from the finished floor to the roof surface except any roof surface higher than the midpoint elevation between the elevation of the roof ridge and the elevation of the roof surface at the point directly above the exterior wall surface of the structure shall be ignored and the midpoint elevation shall be considered the top measurement point for this area if the slope of the roof does not continue linearly to a roof ridge eg as with gambrel and mansard roof styles then the midpoint elevation will be calculated using the projected intersection of

requiring the approval of specific plans showing site design and overall design character prior to development in establishing rp districts the city of mill valley intends to make possible development in which the size and shape of buildings building heights and the open spaces surrounding buildings or groups of buildings may be varied density shall be set at a level or range of dwelling units which is consistent with limitations imposed by onsite natural resource topographic and geologic conditions and by the level of public services and road access that can be reasonably provided the development approval process for rp districts is intended to allow for continuous refinement of the permitted density as additional information is acquired regarding the capacity of the land             procedure for obtaining planned development approval except for uses listed in land zoned rp may not be used developed or graded for purposes of development until plans for development have been approved by the city the procedural steps in obtaining plan approval of lands zoned rp are as follows a a determination of land capacity development density must be obtained pursuant to this land capacity determination is made by the planning commission subject to appeal by the city council after public hearing a technical land capacity report paid for by the applicant and prepared by a person or firm mutually acceptable to the applicant and the city and submitted by the applicant is used by the city as an aid in making the land capacity determination the land capacity determination is intended as a guide to be used by the applicant and the city in preparation and review of a master plan and precise development plan for the property however if justified by subsequent information the city may permit a greater or require a lesser density when a master plan is approved for the property b a master plan must be approved for development of the land pursuant to the general development criteria contained in the preparation of the master plan c following approval of the master plan a precise development plan must be approved pursuant to d since the master plan and precise development plan involve a more detailed study of the property including its geology accessibility and other characteristics information may come to light at these stages which may cause the city to either increase or decrease the allowed development density previously contained in the land capacity determination           division of property no real property zoned rp shall be divided so as to create a parcel of less than 10 contiguous acres unless and until such subdivision is permitted under a planned development which has been approved pursuant to this chapter        uses permitted without

which generally preempt certain subjective landuse regulations limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential deemed granted remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within 60 days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified in 47 usc applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment a applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg cellular wifi satellite microwave backhaul etc the overlap between wireless deployments covered under a and other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with a contained in a section devoted to a will mitigate such potential confusion streamline local review and preserve the citys landuse authority to the maximum extent possible b applicability this section applies to all collocations or modifications to an existing wireless tower or base station
