preface the petersburg alaska municipal originally published by book publishing company in 198 has been kept current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement 9 municipal will be keeping this by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of lb jacobson city attorney the organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus section  is section 040 located in chapter 212 of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 9 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific by individual section numbers this supplement

city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the number for example section  is section 010 in chapter 204 of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own

improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items a in a4 have been fully considered as the lot size increased the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structure listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedure set forth in this section 3 variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in a4 or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7 variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood proofing than watertight or dryflood proofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except b1 and otherwise complies with a and b of the general standards 8 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
