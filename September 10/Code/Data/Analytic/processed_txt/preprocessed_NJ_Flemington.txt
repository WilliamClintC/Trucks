historic district shall be avoided 4 all buildings shall be related harmoniously to the context of the site the neighborhood as a whole and to existing buildings and other structures in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed building or buildings the achievement of such relationship may include the enclosure of space in conjunction with other existingproposed buildings or the creation of focal points with respect to public spaces building designorientation may have to be adjusted in order to maintain a positive spatial relationship or to preserve visual access to community focal points either natural or manmade 5 the selection of building design elements for example in the use of materials windows color texture and other design considerations should ensure that such treatment is generally consistent with traditional and vernacular 18th and 19th and early 20th century architectural styles if the applicant is an existing building the design elements shall be consistent with the existing buildings style and configuration 6 building additions and renovations should be designed to reflect the existing building in terms of scale materials massing window

particular design feature or statement such construction should complement the existing historic building designs in the borough 9 buildings deemed to be significant and indicated as such on the flemington historic district map shall be reviewed with particular care and have special requirements that are described later in this section see  these are buildings that have been determined to be particularly important to the character of the historic district 10 buildings located on main street from the traffic circle to the monument along east main street to hopewell avenue as well as north main street from the monument to hopewell avenue are also considered to be particularly important to the character of flemington and the historic district partly location along the busiest thoroughfare and partly from the quality of buildings along this route many of these structures are indicated to be significant on the flemington historic district map  1631 flemington code  1631 bh because of the importance of this area to the character of the borough all of these buildings will be reviewed with particular care some buildings that are particularly prominent or visible may be reviewed using the same criteria as significant structures even if they are not listed as such on the historic district map 11 contemporary designs for new buildings and for additions to existing buildings or landscaping in the historic district are not discouraged if such designs are compatible with the character scale and materials of the neighborhood and its environment 12 new additions or alterations to buildings should be done in such a manner that they reflect the materials massing and scale of the existing building in addition alterations and additions should be designed such that they are reversible ie that if they were to be removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the original building would be unimpaired 13 exterior alterations should not destroy the distinguishing qualities or character of the property and its environment and the removal or alteration of any historical material or architectural features is not permitted 14 deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible and in the event replacement is necessary the new material should match the material being replaced in composition design color texture and other visual qualities 15 repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of original features substantiated by physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural features from other buildings 16 wherever possible there should be compliance with the standards set forth in the secretary of the interiors standards for the treatment of historic properties as periodically amended and available national park service 17 alternative materials the use of nonhistoric alternative materials may be considered under certain circumstances these materials include but are not limited to vinyl or composite siding smooth finish only  vinyl fiberglass or

located along main street from the traffic circle to the monument along east main street to hopewell avenue as well as north main  1631 general  1631 bh street from the monument to hopewell avenue as indicated in above specifically the use of vinyl siding or windows and doors of alternative materials will be prohibited on the public sides of significant structures where visible roofs need to be replaced on significant structures using replacement materials and methods that match the historic materials is preferable if the use of historic materials is not feasible particular care will be taken in selecting alternative materials that match the historic appearance as closely as possible composite materials that are painted and that match the configuration of the historic materials are considered to be more acceptable than other replacement materials buildings in other parts of the historic district that are considered to be contributing non contributing or encroaching will be permitted to use alternative materials provided that the following conditions are met a vinyl or composite siding shall be smooth ie not textured and shall be of a scale and color compatible with the buildings in the immediate vicinity of the applicant property existing decorative trim shall not be removed or covered by new vinyl siding or trim casing this trim shall be retained and repaired so

commission will consider additional new materials as they become available d alternative materials may be considered for visible roofs when existing slate copper wood shakes etc are shown to be beyond repair the alternative materials on the visible facades shall match the existing appearance as closely as possible alternative materials are acceptable to be used on roofs that are not visible from public streets 18 sustainable energy sources and energy efficiency this not intended to discourage the installation and use of sustainable energy sources including solar panels geothermal wells and wind turbines provided that the installations meet all required building zoning and safety codes etc and that they are installed to have as minimal an impact on the visible portions of the historic

along main street from the traffic circle to the monument along east main street to hopewell avenue as well as north main street from the monument to hopewell avenue 19 this not intended to discourage the improvement of the energy efficiency characteristics of the historic structures in flemington however where energy efficiency improvements are being considered care should be taken to reduce negative impacts on the historic character of the building in particular on all buildings or structures deemed to be significant on the flemington historic district map or that are located along main street from the traffic circle to the monument along east main street to hopewell avenue as well as north main street from the monument to hopewell avenue it is important to keep repair or restore

features if windows and doors must be replaced new windows and doors that match the original design should be used window and door sizes and shapes should not be altered by any building renovation changes to window and door sizes and configurations may be considered if a building is being restored to an earlier documented historic appearance in buildings that are listed as significant or which are located along main street from the traffic circle to the monument along east main street to hopewell avenue as well as north main street from the monument to hopewell avenue replacement doors
