title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the

can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title

property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages   statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the ordinance are intended

safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities upstream construction that alters the rate of natural runoffs and the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages 1 1997  purpose of chapter it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to the health safety and property due to water or erosion in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 2 1997  objectives of chapter the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood height areas  and 7 to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 3 1997  definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section  provided that unless

section is established to encourage the preservation of open space the proliferation of recreational opportunities and the greater efficiency of public services during the development of residential properties clustering lots within subdivisions allows developers to preserve environmentally critical areas such as wetlands embankments and wildlife habitats without decreasing the total density of the subdivision in addition preserving open space reduces soil erosion and flooding open space can be designated for recreational purposes the availability of recreation areas active or passive is conducive to a higher quality of life among residents by clustering homes together public services become more efficient as they require less infrastructure building fewer roads water and sewer lines and other infrastructure helps keep the construction and maintenance of these services associated with them down 2 permitted density the overall allowable density of a clustered subdivision may be found in the following table these numbers were calculated by taking the number of dwelling units per acre permitted in a residential zoning district and rounding down to the nearest tenth of an acre travelers rest zoning f30 permitted density of clustered subdivisions by zoning classification dwelling units per acre zoning classification attached dwelling units detached dwelling units r15 not allowed 29 r10 not allowed 43 r75 not allowed 58 the overall density is calculated by taking the total number dwelling units and dividing it by the total number of acres including both developed and undeveloped land 3 minimum tract and lot requirements there are no requirements on tract size in order for a residential development to be eligible for clustering there is no requirement for minimum lot or yard size unless otherwise required by dhec andor building and fire codes 4 setbacks aside from dhec andor building and fire codes the only setbacks associated with clustered subdivisions are those that deal with properties adjacent to the clustered subdivision all structures must be setback twentyfive 25 feet from exterior lot lines in addition all structures must be setback from existing roads according to the following table structural setback in clustered subdivisions with respect to existing roads structural setback in clustered subdivisions with respect to existing roads road classification structure setback local 25 feet collector 30 feet arterial 40 feet 5 required open space in order for a subdivision to be eligible for clustering land must be set aside as open space all undevelopable land must remain undeveloped undevelopable land includes the following 1 areas of steep slopes 30% or greater 2 areas within the 100year floodplain as designated by fema 3 areas that are designated as wetlands 4 areas that are within twentyfive 25 feet of the edge of a waterbody intermittent or otherwise 5 areas that contain existing utility easements or rights of way with explicit restrictions on development travelers rest zoning f31 for each clustered subdivision twentyfive 25 percent of the total acreage must be designated as composite open space composite open space is calculated with the following formula composite open space   100% of undisturbed open space + 50% of altered open space + 25% of developed common area in order for any area to be included as either undisturbed open space altered open space or developed common area it must meet the following two requirements 1 all designated open space shall be of meaningful proportions and dimensions so as to be consistent with the intent and purpose of this section 2 all designated open space areas shall be accessible to all lots accessibility may be established by adjacency to a lot or by a pedestrian

undevelopable cannot be included as undisturbed open space altered open space or developed common area during the development process it may be deemed necessary to replace andor improve vegetation in undisturbed open areas such an alteration is acceptable in undisturbed open spaces examples of undisturbed open space include wetlands forested areas and shrubbery all land area designated as undisturbed open space can be counted towards the twentyfive 25 percent open space requirement permanent bodies of water either natural or manmade may be included as undisturbed open space 52 altered open space altered open space includes areas where the physical landscape andor vegetation is altered for the benefit of the community although not as beneficial to the environment as undisturbed open space it often provides more active kinds of recreation for the community and is better for the environment than developed common area examples of altered open space include playgrounds ball fields and cleared fields onehalf 50% of all land area designated as altered open space can be counted towards the twentyfive 25 percent open space requirement areas designated as water retention areas may be included as altered open space 53 developed common area developed common areas include locations where community oriented development takes place although developed common areas are not as beneficial to the environment as undisturbed or altered open space these areas provide places for active community oriented recreational areas travelers rest zoning f32 that are important components of a residential neighborhood examples of developed common areas include community pools clubhouses and pavilions onefourth 25% of all the land area designated as developed common areas can be counted towards the twentyfive 25 percent open space requirement 54 conversion to undisturbed open space during the development process it may be deemed necessary to replace vegetation in undisturbed open areas 6 open space ownership dedication and management open space ownership shall be determined by the developer owner andor subdivider types of ownership include the following 1 the city of travelers rest subject to acceptance by the governing body 2 other jurisdictions or agencies subject to their acceptance 3 nonprofit or quasipublic organizations committed to the protection and conservation of open space subject to their acceptance 4 homeowner or cooperative associations or organizations 5 shared undivided interest by all property owners within the subdivision commercial design standards 1 intent this section is established to accomplish three goals 1 to provide protection to residents from poorly designed and aesthetically unattractive commercial developments  2 to provide the developer with clear standards that their projects must adhere to  and 3 create design standards without compromising creativity in design for the developer to accomplish these goals this section places regulations on exterior wall design materials and colors  roof materials and colors  entrances  pedestrian accessibility  landscaping requirements  and screening of outdoor storage disposal hvac equipment and loading operations 2 applicability this section applies to all new development within commercial zoning districts including od office district  c1 commercial district  c2 commercial district  and c1n neighborhood commercial district travelers rest zoning f33 for the c1n neighborhood commercial district design requirements specified during their respective plan review processes may exceed the standards specified in this section 3 design standards the following standards are intended to be used as a design aid by developers proposing retail developments and as an evaluation tool by the travelers rest planning commission during their review processes 31 aesthetic character intent commercial developments have a large impact on the way a community presents itself as such commercial development should be designed in a manner that limits negative visual impacts standard any side of a building visible from a public or private rightofway or a lowdensity residential district r15 r12 r10 and r75 shall be built in accordance with  a exterior walls intent buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest and be consistent with the communitys identity character and scale the intent is to encourage a more human scale that residents of travelers rest will be able to identify with their community the resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of structure by subsequent tenants the elements in the following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric not superficially applied trim graphics or paint standard all exterior developments with an exterior wall over one hundred 100 feet in linear length shall incorporate three different patterned changes at an interval of no more than thirty 30 feet either horizontally or vertically each pattern change must be at least one 1 foot wide patterned changes may include the following color change texture change material change and wall projections or recesses at least two 2 feet in depth at least one of the changes must occur horizontally b roofs intent variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to and reduce the scale of buildings roof features should compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods standard rooflines shall be varied with a change in height every one hundred 100 linear feet in the building length parapets mansard roofs gable roofs hip roofs or dormers shall be used travelers rest zoning f34 to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public view alternating lengths and designs may be acceptable and can be addressed in the development plan c materials intent exterior building materials comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a building therefore they should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods standard predominant exterior building materials shall be of high quality materials these include without limitation brick wood sandstone other native stone and tinted textured concrete masonry units predominant exterior building materials shall not include the following smoothfaced concrete block tiltup concrete panels and prefabricated steel panels 32 site design and relationship to the surrounding community a entrances for larger buildings intent larger commercial buildings should feature multiple entrances multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores or identified departments in a store multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses standard each commercial structure exceeding 25000 square feet of space shall have two entrances the two entrances must be located on two different exterior walls that would be most appropriate for access from adjacent parking areas b entryways intent entryway design elements and variations should provide orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building the standards identify desirable entryway design features standard each building on a site shall have clearly defined highly visible customer entryways featuring no less than three of the following canopies or porticos overhangs travelers rest zoning f35 recessesprojections arcades raised corniced parapets over the door peaked roof forms arches outdoor patios display windows planters wing walls and any other architectural detail or feature that accentuates the entryways for the public c windows for smaller buildings intent smaller retail stores provide an intimate retail experience it is not uncommon for small retail stores to construct plain buildings with little or no architectural details to provide a sense of human scale windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades standard each commercial structure not exceeding 25000 square feet shall incorporate windows into their design each exterior wall with an entrance shall have transparent windows between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than forty 40 percent of the horizontal length of the exterior wall windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills shutters or other forms of framing d parking lot orientation intent parking areas should provide safe convenient and efficient access for vehicles and pedestrians they should be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the overall scale of the paved surface if buildings are located closer to the streets the scale of the complex is reduced pedestrian traffic is encouraged and architectural details take on added importance standard no more than sixty 60 percent of the offstreet parking spaces for the entire property shall be located between a single exterior wall and a public or private rightofway e nearby residential areas intent in general the introduction of intense commercial uses to nearby lowdensity residential uses causes a significant land use conflict as such any time commercial development is to occur it must be considered carefully in order to limit the negative impacts the commercial developments would have on the surrounding community standards when the property is adjacent to singlefamily residential uses r75 &10 r12 and r15 an earthen berm shall be installed no less than 6 feet in height containing at a travelers rest zoning f36 minimum a double row of evergreen or deciduous trees planted at intervals of 15 feet on center additional landscaping may be required by the planning commission to effectively buffer adjacent land use as deemed appropriate f outdoor storage trash collection loading areas and utility areas intent areas associated with outdoor storage trash collection loading and utilities often exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods the disturbances created by commercial uses are commonly associated with these specific activities and locations as such they should be carefully considered when developed standards areas for outdoor storage truck parking trash collection and compaction loading or any other similar activities shall 1 not be visible from the right from any public or private rightofway  2 not be located within twenty 20 feet of any public or private street sidewalk or internal pedestrian way and 3 be screened or incorporated with materials and in a manner consistent with the rest of the site thereby reducing the presence of them g seasonal inventory and sales intent many commercial establishments utilize parking areas as commercial space during peak times this practice must be carefully considered standards nonenclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls andor fences materials colors and designs of screening walls fences and covers shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings h pedestrian flows intent pedestrian accessibility opens autooriented developments to the neighborhood thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier more inviting image this section sets forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide userfriendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety shelter and convenience within the site due to the scope of large structures additional steps should be taken to make areas more pedestrianfriendly standards

sidewalks no less than five 5 feet in width shall be provided along the full length of the building along any exterior wall featuring a customer entrance and along any exterior wall abutting public parking areas for commercial structures exceeding 25000 square feet such sidewalks shall be located at least six 6 feet from the exterior wall of the building to provide planting beds for foundation landscaping except where features such as arcades or entryways are part of the exterior wall internal pedestrian walkways shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within thirty 30 feet of all customer entrances constructed parallel to the exterior wall of the building this is not intended to extend into the driving aisles or parking areas all internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces use of durable low maintenance surface materials such as pavers bricks or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort as well as the attractiveness of the walkways i connectivity intent limiting the impacts of traffic on the existing road network is important limiting the number of curb cuts onto large roads and promoting connectivity between adjacent uses helps to make the transportation system more efficient the traffic patterns created by new development must be developed in a manner that mitigates the negative impacts of increased traffic demands safety and efficient transit are paramount when promoting connectivity standard each commercial structure with offstreet parking must provide a vehicular connection to each undeveloped adjacent commerciallyzoned property od c1 c2 and c1n that shares at least fifty 50 feet of property line at a minimum vehicular connections must be at least twentyfour 24 feet wide if connections are required for more than one adjacent property the developer should employ some type of traffic calming measure such as speed humps traffic circles curvilinear driving aisles or indirect access between connections j curb cuts intent traffic impact is an important consideration in any new development increasing safe and efficient traffic flow when accessing new development is paramount standards ingress and egress points to a property should be minimized whenever possible shared access for adjacent lots should be encouraged limiting the amount of access to a road decreases the negative impacts of new development on existing traffic patterns travelers rest zoning f38 access points to new developments shall be spaced a minimum distance from existing access points based upon the speed limit of the road being accessed from speed of road minimum space between centerlines of access points 30 mph or less 100 feet  3135 mph 150 feet  3640 mph 200 feet  4145 mph 250 feet  4650 mph 300 feet  55 mph or more 350 feet  when possible new development should design vehicular access in a way that encourages the use of shared drives k central features and community spaces intent buildings should offer attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features spaces and amenities entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations bus stops and dropoffpickup points should be considered as integral parts of the configuration pedestrian ways should be anchored by special design features such as towers arcades porticos pedestrian light fixtures bollards planter walls and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces the features and spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric standards each structure with greater than 25000 square feet of commercial space shall contribute to the establishment of enhancement of community and public spaces by providing one amenity per 25000 square feet of commercial space up to a maximum of two amenities from the following list 1 patioseating
