user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards may be terminated at the discretion of the potw a upset 1 for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of 3 are met 3 an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures c the industrial user has submitted the following information to the potw and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days  a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance 4 in any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof 5 industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination of any claim of upset only in an enforcement action  18042 charter  18043 c265 brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 6 the industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b generalspecific prohibitions an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in  18032a of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the potw was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 definitions as used in this subsection the following terms shall have the meanings indicated bypass  the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility severe property damage  substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of 3 and 4 of this section 3 need for bypass a if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible  18043 middletown code  18043 c266  18044 miscellaneous provisions b an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the potw within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 bypass prohibited a bypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless  bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage   there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and  the industrial user submitted notices as required under 3 of this

stormwater management  19228 middletown code  19228 c294 article i general provisions  1981 statement of findings the middletown township council finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation degrades water quality overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c through project design impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive areas ie stream buffers riparian corridors floodplains steep slopes very steep slopes etc and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime d inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens e the aforementioned impacts happen mainly decrease in natural infiltration of stormwater f stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater  1981 charter  1981 c295  1982 purpose the purpose of this comprehensive stormwater management ordinance is to promote health safety and welfare within middletown township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  1981 of this chapter designed to h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes and are required to reduce sediment and other pollutants from entering the ms4 i nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 can contribute to pollution of surface waters of the commonwealth by the township a meet water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams b promote nonstructural best management practices bmp c minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flow d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems g maintain the predevelopment volume of groundwater recharge and prevent degradation of groundwater quality h maintain the predevelopment peak and volume of stormwater runoff and prevent degradation of surface water quality i minimize nonpoint source pollutant loadings to the ground and surface waters j minimize impacts on stream temperatures k maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the township and the commonwealth l preserve

statement of intent a flooding can result in loss of property and life damage to structures injury to people disruption of public and private activities and services burdensome public expenditures for flood protection and relief and the loss of public and private revenues much of the harm caused by flooding occurs because of 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions land uses and activities in the natural floodplain which cause increased flood heights and velocity  and 2 the development of uses vulnerable to floods in areas subject to flooding a in addition to the general goals and objectives of this chapter it is the purpose of this article to eliminate or minimize the harmful effects of flooding b this article is also intended to meet the requirements of the national flood insurance program and to comply with the pennsylvania floodplain management act as amended the regulations of the pennsylvania department of community and economic development promulgated pursuant to the act however in several respects the provisions of this article are intended to exceed minimal statutory requirements c to reduce the threat of flooding the provisions of this article are designed to 1 minimize the public and private financial burdens caused by floods  2 prevent the construction of buildings and other structures in areas unfit for such uses because of flooding  3 discourage the creation of lots where the lot area is subject to flooding   275167 charter  275168 c799 4 require that any new lot which is created with part of its area subject to flooding be configured so that it will provide a safe building site with adequate access  5 require that prospective purchasers andor lessees be given prior notice that the property being sold or leased is located within an area subject to flooding andor that the existing use is permitted only as a conditional use or variance subject to conditions of this chapter  6 permit only those uses in areas subject to flooding which are compatible with sound conservation practices and the preservation of desirable natural conditions which promote the maintenance of water flow rates throughout the year  7 prevent downstream damage from increased flood volumes and rates of flow while permitting uses of the floodplain which are compatible with the preservation of natural conditions necessary to preserve stormwater conveyance functions of the floodplain  8 control development which alone or in combination with other development could create or contribute to flood damage and disruption  9 permit certain uses which are appropriate for areas subject to flooding and which will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise create situations harmful to life or property either above or below their locations  10 limit reconstruction of damaged or destroyed structures located in areas subject to flooding  11 limit the expansion of structures and uses located in areas subject to flooding  12 require that all uses in areas subject to flooding be appropriately protected against flood damage  13 preserve the ability of floodplain areas to store and absorb stormwater runoff and protect their stormwater carrying capacity to stabilize the rate of stormwater discharge  14 prevent increases in flood volume and upstream flood elevations which result from placing impervious surfaces and obstructions in floodplains
