impervious cover within a watershed often alter the hydrologic response and water quality aspects of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion sediment transport and deposition and the concentration of waterborne pollutants and pathogens b clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion and reduce the native vegetation important for terrestrial habitat for stream regulation for maintenance of natural food cycles important to food chains and aquatic habitat effective erosion controls are important techniques in preventing water pollution soil loss wildlife habitat loss and human property loss clearing and grading is particularly disruptive within stream corridors contributing to streambank erosion loss of vegetative cover overland transport of pollutants into the stream and loss of riparian habitat c improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase downstream flooding and increase the velocity of stormwater runoff causing stream bank erosion and buildup of sedimentation d impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow e stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled minimized and in some cases eliminated regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities illicit discharges must be eliminated f the regulation of stormwater discharges from new development and redevelopment of existing sites the elimination of illicit discharges and the control of erosion sediment and stormwater discharge is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety posed by unmanaged runoff g the creation of a stormwater
