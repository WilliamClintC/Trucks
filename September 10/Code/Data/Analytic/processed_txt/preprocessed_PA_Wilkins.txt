resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health
