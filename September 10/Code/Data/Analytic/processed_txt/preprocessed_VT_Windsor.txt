what road finishing and surfacing will be required as a condition of road acceptance or upgrade 1 arterial and collector highways will normally require pavement nonarterial and noncollector highways will not normally require paving although may require paving based on certain factors including steep grades traffic volumes or truck traffic 2 paving generally is required for highways expected to handle greater than 400 vehicles per day7 6 it is not always beneficial to the town to pave roadways that are proposed for acceptance paved highways may be more expensive to maintain in the future than gravel roadways the selectboard may choose some all or none of these possible policies or may decide other standards see also vermont local roads program fact sheet when to pave a gravel road and vlcts vermont local roads model highway the selectboard may elect to use a lower or higher threshold for paving vermont local roads program mentions figures from as low as 50 vehicles per day to

effective  amended  effective  amended  effective  windsor title 14 1 title 14  placement of coinoperated newspaper vending machines purpose and intent1 the town of windsor vermont is a commercially active but small community which possesses a natural beauty and an historic character which has long been recognized by its residents and others its economic base is substantially supported by that recognition and the tourism it generates a large number of properties located in the town are listed on both the national and state registers of historic places the commercial center of the town is located wholly within a designated historic area in addition it is also intersected by a major us highway as a result of the tourism and volume of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and currently suffers from a shortage of designated parking the town finds and declares that the uncontrolled placement and maintenance of coinoperated newspaper vending machines hereinafter referred to as newsracks on the public rightofway and the proliferation of such devices unreasonably interferes with and obstructs the public use of such rightsofway  creates an aesthetically displeasing situation and is such an obstruction of the free use of public property that it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community and others the town also finds however that the use of such rightsofway is so historically associated with he sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to these areas should not be absolutely denied the municipality further finds and declares that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation that can only be satisfactorily achieved means of this ordinance designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time place and manner of using such newsracks the purpose of this ordinance is to regulate the placement installation design and maintenance of newsracks in public areas of the town in order to further protect and preserve the aesthetic and historic characteristics of the town and its economic base and in general to promote the public health safety welfare and convenience of its residents and others it is a further purpose of this ordinance to recognize and give adequate protection to the rights of newspaper and news periodical owners to have their publications distributed ___________________________ 1 this section is adapted from both the los angeles county the woodstock  definitions for purposes of this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings set forth herein a newsrack shall mean any coinoperated box container storage unit or other windsor title 14 2 dispenser installed used or maintained for the display and sale of

section is adapted from the los angeles city yonkers ny  where the newsrack will endanger persons or property  windsor title 14 3 j where the newsrack will unreasonably interfere with or obstruct the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the highway  k at any location whereby the clear space for the passage of pedestrians is reduced to less than five 5 feet l notwithstanding the above restrictions the two newsracks now in place in front of the us post office as presently sited and any replacements thereof which comply with above shall be deemed to be in compliance with these placement requirements registration and identification of newsracks4 each newsrack must bear in a conspicuous place the identity of the owner if the name address and telephone number of its owner is not readily and publicly available eg from the vermont secretary of state or from a vermont telephone directory the newsrack must also bear such information sanctions for violations of chapters 35 a violations of municipal officials will make all reasonable efforts to correct any violations at the scene if officials are unable to do so the newsrack owner will be notified that his newsrack is in violation of the ordinance after notification the owner will have fifteen 15 business days either to bring his newsrack into compliance with the ordinance or to contest the allegation if he chooses to contest the alleged violation an administrative hearing will be scheduled the newsrack will not be removed until after the owner has had an opportunity to make a judicial appeal from the administrative hearing5 _____________________ 4 this section is strictly a bookkeeping device 5 in an effort to ensure that these enforcement provisions pass constitutional muster they have been made extremely weak indeed it would be a lengthy process before the town could remove a newsrack unless the newsrack posed an imminent danger the regulatory provisions of this ordinance are so reasonable however it is unlikely that a newsrack owner would ever go to the time and expense of contesting a violation when he could easily fix it the potential exception to this rule of course is the owner who is contesting the constitutionality of the regulatory provisions a newsrack will be summarily removed for violating of this ordinance only if the violation creates an imminent danger of personal injury or property damage the owner will be notified and may reclaim his impounded newsrack an impoundment fee will be assessed but does not have to be paid before the owner can claim his newsrack the fee can be contested in court on the grounds that the newsrack was improperly seized6 b violations of if an owner has failed to put appropriate identification on his newsrack he will be notified and the violation will be treated in the same manner as a violation of chapters 3 and 4 if the owner has failed to place identification on the newsrack such that it is impossible to notify the owner because it is impossible to identify him his newsrack will be tagged and he will windsor title 14 4 have at least one month to add such identification as is required to comploy with chapter 5 agreement to hold harmless any person who installs places or maintains a newsrack in the town of windsor shall by such act or acts be deemed to have agreed to defend at the option of the town  indemnify and hold harmless the town its officers trustees manager agents and employees from and against all claims causes of action suits losses and damages including expenses attorneys fees and costs for bodily or personal injury and for property damage sustained by any person as a result of the installation placement use or maintenance of such rewsrack within the town of windsor a person who installs or places a newsrack in the town of windsor shall within fourteen 14 days of such installation or placement file with the town manager a written statement agreeing to so indemnify the town of windsor severability if any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are severable _________________ 6 this provision protects the municipalitys right to remove newsracks posing an imminent danger and recover impoundment fees it also however protects the newsrack owner by letting him immediately recover the newsrack and contest the impoundment fee later of course the municipality sacrifices the advantage of insuring that it will receive fees properly owned effective  public hearing  on amended windsor title 15 1
