interest during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of the city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 25 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to date number 922 passed  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy

broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this assist in locating specific information at

mobile home ordinance footnotes  2  editors note contained herein was adopted by initiative election held on  measure l passed by the voters on  amended allow city council to amend  after public hearing before the rent appeals board and a fourfifths vote of the city council repealed the provisions of which added entitled mobile home space rent adjustment and registration to the findings and purpose the purpose of this chapter is to alleviate the hardship of unreasonable rent increases while still assuring owners right to a fair return a the city council finds the following conclusions to be true and correct 1 in rohnert park there are five mobile home parks containing one thousand three hundred seventeen spaces of which one thousand three hundred nine spaces are available for rental to mobile home coach owners in 1995 2 mobile homes provide an important form of affordable housing for a substantial number of rohnert park residents 3 the majority of mobile home park homeownersresidents are age fiftyfive or older 4 the majority of mobile home park homeownersresidents own the mobile homes which they occupy and many of these homeownersresidents typically have substantial loan payments to meet in addition to rent payments 5 the rohnert park general plan recommends that the city maintain and preserve its existing stock of affordable housing of which mobile home park spaces are typically an example 6 studies undertaken in surrounding areas have shown that typical moving costs for mobile homes from one mobile home park to another if vacant spaces could be located range from approximately five thousand dollars to nine thousand dollars depending upon the size of the mobile home in many instances removal requires a separation of the mobile home unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobile home 7 mobile homes and manufactured housing have represented an affordable form of shelter to citizens of rohnert park with modest incomes because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income space rent increases can have a significant impact on these families 8 the need for effective and fair mobile home park space rent stabilization continues to exist in rohnert park 9 it would be desirable to provide prospective homeownersresidents of mobile home coaches with an option to choose between a longterm lease and a periodic tenancy of less than one year in duration such an option furthers a legitimate governmental objective and is not in conflict with or preempted by state law 10 on average several mobile home coaches are sold or offered for sale each year in rohnert park it would be highly desirable to provide vacancy control in the rent stabilization program as hereunder provided 11 the city further finds that this article is necessary to preserve public health welfare and safety 12 there exist substantial differences in space rents within given mobile home parks in rohnert park b the purpose of this chapter is to stabilize the rate of mobile home park space rental in order to 1 prevent exploitation of a shortage of vacant mobile home park spaces should it occur  2 prevent excessive and unreasonable mobile home park space rent increases while still assuring park owners right to a fair return  3 provide a process for ensuring mobile home park owners a fair just and reasonable rate of return on their parks in cases where the guaranteed annual space rent increase provided by this chapter proves insufficient 4 assist in protecting affordable housing to help provide a variety of housing types within a range of costs affordable to the low and very low income households 5

net operating income landlords shall be entitled to earn a just and reasonable return and to maintain and increase their base year net operating income in accordance with subparagraph h herein g rebutting the presumption it may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded other than a fair return in which case the base year net operating income may be adjusted accordingly in order to make such a determination the board must make at least one of the following findings i the landlords operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so that the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time in considering whether the base year net operating income yielded more or less than a fair net operating income the board shall consider the following factors a the landlord made substantial capital improvements during the base year which were not reflected in the base year rent levels  b substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by uninsured disaster or vandalism  c maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration of housing services  d other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding prudent business practice ii the rent on the base date was disproportionately low due to the fact that it was not established in an armslength transaction or other peculiar circumstances h fair net operating income

not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit written prior notice to the city engineer at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the city engineer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass the city engineer may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twneyfour hours c bypass is prohibited and the city engineer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineer judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under paragraph b of this section d the city engineer may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the city engineer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph c of this section  2222011   affirmative defense a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions set forth in section  excluding subsections b1 2 and 8 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  2222011   disputesrequest for ruling if any user or applicant for a permit disputes the interpretation or application of this sewer use ordinance it may request a ruling by the city engineer who will set forth his or her determinations on

utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  part 2007   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  part 2007

c if a and b are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article  part 2007 variance procedure   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2007   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles ii and iii of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the sonoma county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  part 2007   appeal board a the city council of the city of rohnert park shall hear and decide appeals and request for variances from the requirements of this chapter b the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement of administration of this chapter c in passing upon such applications the

flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city of

to this article the following definitions apply development  means a set of land use regulations adopted in conformance with the general plan that provide the standards for development all actions and undertakings necessary for project planning land acquisition demolition or construction of a project must conform with the regulations of the development code before approval a development code is also known as a zoning code formbased  means a code that uses physical form rather than separation of land uses as the organizing principle a formbased code is an alternative to conventional zoning formbased codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another and the scale and types of streets and blocks the regulations and standards in formbased codes presented in both diagrams and words correspond to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale and therefore character of development rather than solely distinctions in landuse types regulating plan means a zoning map or plan that delineate the boundaries of individual zones transect zones civic zones special districts and special requirements if any of areas subject to regulation by a formbased code transect zone or t zone means one of several areas on a zoning map or regulating plan regulated by the formbased code transect zones are administratively similar to the land use zones in conventional codes except that in addition to building use density height and setback requirements other elements are integrated including without limitation private lot building and public frontage c establishment of formbased codes in order to further the goals and policies of the general plan the city council may adopt and amend formbased codes for planned development or specific plan areas identified in the general plan or for other geographically discrete areas within the rohnert park planning area sphere of influence as may be specified by the city council such codes may provide for among other subjects the establishment of building design site design and other designrelated standards that once adopted shall apply to

setting the cap if triggered for purposes of this chapter residential building permit implementation shall occur one year after the issuance of the building permit for a given residential dwelling unit 2 an applicant for a final discretionary approval shall submit a phasing plan that identifies the years in which residential building permits are expected to be implemented for the development 3 for final discretionary approvals occurring in years that no residential development cap is in place a condition shall be imposed on the final discretionary approval that the first residential building permit shall be obtained within three years of the date of the final discretionary approval and that any subsequent residential building permits shall be applied for in accordance with the phasing plan approved pursuant to subsection a2 of this section if a residential building permit application is not filed in accordance with the time periods set forth in this section the issuance of
