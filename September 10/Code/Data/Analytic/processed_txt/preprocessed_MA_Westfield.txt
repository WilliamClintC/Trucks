good health safety and general welfare of all users of property within areas prone to flooding  to minimize the need for flood rescue and relief efforts generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  to minimize prolonged interruptions of business  to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities  to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and to insure that all users of land within the flood prone areas are notified of the potential hazards that may be caused by flooding the floodplain management district is also intended to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by special requirements designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion flood heights and velocities  2 require that land uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which reinvolved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands general provisions the floodplain management district is herein established as an overlay district to include all special flood hazard areas within the

encourage the permanent preservation of open space agricultural lands and other natural and cultural resources including views of open space from both existing city roads and from within the development  b encourage a less sprawling form of development therefore consuming less open land and allowing for the protection of ridgelines hillsides roadway corridors and other visually sensitive landscapes c maintain the traditional new england rural character and land use patterns in which small villages connect with open spaces and farmlands thus facilitating direct access to open space by residents of the open space community d allow for greater flexibility and creativity in residential design which facilitates the addition of recreational and aesthetic amenities to new neighborhoods e facilitate the construction and maintenance of streets utilities and public services in a more economical and efficient manner  general requirements the following requirements apply to all open space communities a the development shall include only those housing types otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district b the minimum land area required shall be no less than five acres contiguous except for separations due to intervening roadways and held in single ownership or control at the time of application c each building lot shall be located and of a size and shape to provide a building site which will not create adverse impacts upon the natural terrain or other land features 560 2 d in order to facilitate multimodal circulation there shall be an adequate safe and convenient arrangement of sidewalks bike lanes and paths walking paths roadways alleys driveways and parking as appropriate e prior to submission of the special permit application to the planning board the plan

act mgl the city of westfield local as amended  2 all ground surfaces with a slope of greater than 25%  and 3 all areas of floodplain identified as flood zone a on the most recent fema flood insurance rate map f notwithstanding approvals hereunder an open space community must comply with all other applicable local and state regulations g open space shall be retained primarily in contiguous areas front back and side yards of building lots are not counted toward the open space requirement dimensional and density requirements residential dwelling units and lawful accessory structures may be constructed on lots within an open space community although such lots have less area and frontage than normally required provided the layout demonstrates preservation of open land in furtherance of the stated purposes of this section and the overall density of the development is no greater than what is normally allowed in the zoning district the maximum number of dwelling units is based on developable land areas identified in 5 602e above shall be excluded the remaining land shall then be further reduced by 20 percent to account for roadway area and layout constrains the final land area is then divided by the minimum lot size normally required in the district to arrive at the maximum number of dwelling units permitted in the open space community where in the judgement of the board the aforementioned method will not result in a reasonable estimate of the number of dwelling units which could be built on the parcel conventionally the board may require the applicant to provide further evidence in the form of a conventional preliminary plan in conformance with the subdivision regulations and applicable zoning in the district evidence of successful percolation testing and soil evaluations sufficient to meet board of health requirements for onsite disposal systems and approvals by the conservation commission of any work in areas under their jurisdiction there shall be excluded from the number of lots shown on the conventional preliminary plan all lots which the board finds are not reasonably buildable whether by reason of excessive development and site preparation

yard requirements above no two flag lots may adjoin one another at the street design requirements where appropriate in the judgement of the board for the individual development site the following additional criteria shall be incorporated into the proposed site plan for an open space community 1 open space layout open space should include the most sensitive resource areas on the property and should be designed as larger blocks of land fragmentation or the creation of long thin strips of open space should be avoided whenever possible the open space shall be laid out to preserve roadside views along city roads and views from city roads into the development physical and visual access to the open space for homeowners shall be maximized in the design of the development with open space areas readily differentiated from private lots wherever possible when open space directly adjoins private lots it shall be demarcated with logical straightforward boundaries such as existing rock

the far edges of open fields c residential and agricultural areas are situated to minimize the lengths of any common boundaries between new house lots and lands preserved for agriculture d dwelling units and nonagricultural structures are separated from the agricultural uses by a 100 foot wide buffer strip of trees and native plantings sufficient to reduce conflicts between farming operations and residents 8 upland areas in areas of greater than 15% slope or upon hilltops and ridgelines lots shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible to achieve the following objectives a potential
