cleveland ohio  beaumont texas  dallas texas  newport news virginia  bellevue washington  new york new york  st croix county wisconsin  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 and 253448  8 there continue to be increasing numbers of reported cases of aids in the state of missouri 9 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in missouri 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article  22211 definitions for the purposes of this article the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section adult entertainment establishment a a striptease club or pornographic movie theater whose business is the commercial sale

utility hereinafter referred to as utility is a nonregulated utility as defined by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa and as such is required to adhere to the provisions of of the act pertaining to cogeneration and small power production regulations were prepared by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for the implementation of purpa and published in the federal register 45fr12214  the mascoutah municipal electric utility will 1 purchase the electrical output from cogenerators and small power producers at a price that equals the utilitys avoided costs  2 make available system cost data upon which avoided costs can be calculated  and 3 sell energy and capacity to cogenerators and small power producers for supplementary backup maintenance and interruptible power service  subject to the regulations hereinafter set forth b the rules set forth in this plan will apply to all entities which can be classified as qualifying cogeneration facilities or qualifying small power production facilities and which would enter into an agreement with the utility for the purchase and sale of energy or capacity and energy c provisions for these rules shall not supersede or negate existing contracts for service d these rules are not intended to be all inclusive nor to apply to all situations which may arise they do represent guidelines for establishing an agreement between the utility and a qualifying facility for the purchase sale or interchange of energy or energy and capacity since the production capacity of qualifying facilities may vary widely in size and type the utility is precluded from establishing rules and procedures which will readily accommodate each potential qualifying facility therefore the utility will evaluate each potential qualifying facility on a casebycase basis preamble the broad purpose of the public utility regulatory act of 1978 purpa is to encourage conservation of energy and efficient use of energy resources by utility systems cogeneration or small power producers can supply all or a portion of their own electric requirements thereby relieving the area utility system which serves the cogenerator or small power producer of providing this energy furthermore if the cogenerator or small power producer can produce energy in excess of its needs this excess can be sold to the utility system in both cases the utility system is relieved from supplying the energy and from constructing generating facilities to serve the load energy is conserved construction of power generating facilities by the utility is postponed and maximum use is made of existing generating plants the mascoutah municipal electric utility is in agreement with the intent of purpa concerning cogeneration and small power production and offers to cooperate with such facilities which may be developed in the mascoutah service area under a mutually beneficial arrangement the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rulemaking on cogeneration and small power production requires that the mascoutah municipal electric utility implement subpart c of of the rules which may consist of the issuance of regulation by the mascoutah municipal electric utility for cogeneration and small power producers in the mascoutah service area these regulations must be placed in effect on or before  after a public hearing to be held in the city of mascoutah the following regulations will be used to establish the terms under which a cogeneration or small power producing facility can be connected to the mascoutah system a supplementary power means electric energy or capacity supplied by the utility regularly used by a qualifying facility in addition to that which the facility generates itself b backup power means electric energy or capacity supplied by the utility to replace energy ordinarily generated by a qualifying facility own generation equipment during an unscheduled outage of the facility c interruptible power means electric energy or capacity supplied by the utility subject to interruption by the utility under specified conditions d maintenance power means electric energy or capacity supplied by the utility during scheduled outages of the qualifying facility e accredited capacity means the electrical rating in kilowatts kw given to generating equipment based on a number of factors these factors include the equipment availability reliability type and the extent to which the equipment may be coordinated between the qualifying facility and the utility f capacity costs means that portion of total electrical costs which are associated with providing the capacity to acquire or deliver power these include the amortization of the capital cost required to produce and transmit power or to purchase like capacity from another system g point of measurement means the point or points where power and energy are metered h point of delivery or interconnection means the point or points where the qualifying facility will receive power andor energy from the utility or deliver power andor energy to the utility i energy costs are that portion of total electrical costs associated with providing energy as measured in kilowatthours kwh the energy costs consist largely of the variable costs associated with power production as distinct from fixed costs associated with capacity costs as well as purchased energy service conditions the following conditions will apply to all qualifying facilities a the utility will purchase electricity produced by qualifying facilities at a price equal to the utilitys avoided cost such purchase may be energy only or capacity and energy the purchase of capacity will be dependent on the utilitys need and the availability of capacity from the qualifying facility during periods of peak usage b the utility will sell capacity and energy to the qualifying facility as required to meet qualifying facilitys electrical requirements service provided will be billed under the appropriate utility retail rate schedule in effect for the customer classification appropriate for the qualifying facility c the utility will provide supplementary power backup power maintenance power and interruptible power upon request of a qualifying facility the guarantee of service to a qualifying facility however shall be no greater than that provided other retail customers of the utility d the utility and qualifying facility will enter into a written agreement for service requested under section 1123c above if the utility waives the requirement for an agreement initially this will not preclude the utilitys request for a written agreement at a later date e the qualifying facility shall fulfill the requirements set forth by the national electric safety the american society of mechanical engineers the american national standard institute and other appropriate standards applicable to the facilities installed local state and national codes shall be strictly adhered to in the event of a dispute over the proper standards the utility shall render final decision it shall be the obligation of the qualifying facility to deliver to the utility complete and detailed information on the electrical characteristics of the proposed generating facility and on the control and protective schemes to be installed for synchronizing and for protection of the utility system f the utility will interconnect its system for parallel operation with the qualifying facility if the utility is satisfied that such parallel operation will not impair service to its customers or cause hazardous operating procedures all costs of the interconnection which are in excess of the costs which the utility would incur if the utility and qualifying facility were not interconnected will be paid for by the qualified facility it is the responsibility of the qualifying facility to operate in such a manner that parallel operations will not result in a decrease in the quality of service normally maintained on the utilitys system g the utility shall at all times have access to switching equipment installed for the purpose of isolating the qualifying facility from utilitys system this provision is mandatory in order to safeguard personnel and equipment of the utility as well as the qualifying facility if required the utility may operate without advance notice or liability the switching equipment if in the sole opinion of the utilitys personnel continued parallel operation of the qualifying facility and the utility could result in a safety hazard or emergency situation h in the event the utility deemed necessary the operation of switching equipment as described in section 1123g above the utilitys obligation to purchase electricity produced by the qualifying facility would cease at such time as the situation requiring isolation of the two systems was corrected the schedule of purchasing would be resumed i the qualifying facility agrees that the utility shall be indemnified and held harmless from all liability which could arise from operation and interconnection of the facilities owned by the qualifying facility the responsibility for the proper and safe installation and operation of production and transmission facilities required to delivery electricity to the point of interconnection is that of the qualifying facility j the utility may cease purchasing energy or capacity and energy from the qualifying facility if the continued purchase in utilitys opinion would result in costs higher than those incurred if utility was not purchasing from the qualifying facility k the utility will not cease purchasing energy or energy and capacity without reasonable notice in order that the qualifying facility may adjust operations of production equipment accordingly l the utility may curtail or discontinue sales to the qualifying facility during an emergency on the utility system however such curtailment or discontinuation will be nondiscriminatory m the utility may with agreement by the qualifying facility transmit wheel energy or capacity to any other utility for purchase by that utility the utility shall receive fair compensation from the qualifying facility for this service n the utility will determine the manner of payment from the qualifying facility for the costs of interconnection where interconnection costs may impose a financial burden on the utility an advance payment from the qualifying facility will be required the difference between the total interconnection costs and the advance payment may at utilitys option be amortized over a reasonable period of time o the utility reserves the right to inspect and review preliminary plans for cogenerators and small power production facilities to be constructed to determine whether the physical facilities contemplated will interfere with or in any manner cause a potential operational or safety hazard to utilitys physical facilities rates a the utility will purchase energy or capacity and energy from a qualifying facility at rates which are not discriminatory against the facility b the utility will not purchase energy or capacity and energy from a new qualifying facility at a cost which exceeds the utilitys avoided cost a new facility is one which construction commenced on or after  c the utility will purchase the surplus electric production from old capacity construction commenced prior to  at a negotiated rate mutually agreeable to both parties d the utility will pay a qualifying facility for 100 kw or less a standard rate based on avoided cost except as specified in section 1124c applying to old capacity e the utility may purchase from a qualifying facility at a standard rate if mutually agreeable the qualifying facility may choose to furnish at its option energy at the utilitys avoided cost at time of delivery or capacity and energy under a negotiated contract at utilitys avoided cost f the utility shall upon request provide data comparable to that required under paragraph b of subpart c of of the ferc rules to enable a qualifying facility to estimate the utilitys avoided costs avoided costs will be the actual or estimated energy costs from utilitys generation or energy purchased by the utility from other suppliers avoided costs shall include an adjustment for variations in line losses as a result of displacing existing energy sources with energy from qualifying facility g the utility will pay avoided capacity costs to a qualifying facility where a legally enforceable contract provides that qualifying facility will supply accredited capability to the utility the payment for the capacity dedicated will be based on the capacity costs the utility would incur if the capacity were obtained from a source other than the qualifying facility the capacity payment will reflect the following considerations 1 anticipated future capacity costs 2 availability of capacity during utility peak periods 3 the ability of the utility to dispatch the capacity of the qualifying facility 4 anticipated reliability of the qualifying facility 5 term of the obligation 6 ability to coordinate capacity of qualifying facility with utilitys scheduled outages 7 advantages which may accrue to the utility as a result of purchasing capacity in more easily absorbed increments from the qualifying facility than may be available to utility from other sources metering the utility favors the twometer method of determining energy interchange with the qualifying facility which provides for the simultaneous metering of the flow of power and energy to and from the qualifying facility power and energy delivered to the utility is paid for at the agreed upon avoided cost or standard rate power and energy delivered to the qualifying facility is paid under the retail rate schedule applicable to the rate classification of the qualifying facility small qualifying facilities will be metered with a single meter without detents and billings rendered on the net reading miscellaneous considerations the following considerations are brought to the attention of a potential qualifying facility these considerations are not intended to be allinclusive but are offered to assist the potential facility in evaluating the prospects a property use classification and tax implications b cost to interconnect to the utility system c building codes and permits d environmental impacts and regulatory constraints e safety f liabilityexposure to and insurance coverage g federal state county and city rules and regulations 1 although the qualifying facility can be exempt from certain state regulations on rates and financial organization and federal regulation under the federal power act and the public utility holding company act of 193 it is recommended that the facilitys legal counsel render an opinion concerning these exemptions as they may apply to the specific qualifying facility

one cut 2 large limbs should be removed with a series of three cuts make an undercut about one half way limb away from the main trunk then make a top cut in the same area but slightly further out from the trunk then the first cut this will remove the weight and bulk and leave a manageable stub to remove without damaging the trunk of the tree the third cut is a smooth cut from the bottom up to remove the remaining stub h do not 1 make flush cut behind the bbr 2 leave living or dead stubs 3 injure or remove the branch collar 4 paint cuts or otherwise treat the cuts 5 top or misshape the tree

plows snow there are two phases for ice and snow response 1 when snow or ice conditions exist salt is applied based on public safety needs starting with primary arterial streets and major intersections  and 2 depending on pavement conditions and forecast snow plowing will likely commence when two inches of snow accumulates it is standard practice to avoid salting either secondary streets or in newer subdivisions as repeated salting of concrete leads to deterioration of that material c conditions such as blowing snow continual freezing rain accumulation forecast conditions or the need to assist with high priority state or county roadways vary for each snow and ice event accordingly some streets may not be treated snow and ice response goals are set primarily to afford public safety crews the ability to provide emergency services general travel commerce or individual convenience issues take a lower priority and are not always able to be accommodated an ongoing

protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or redevelopment or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth andor changes the stormwater drainage pattern andor stormwater flows from that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural state this stormwater runoff and resulting soil erosion could result in the inundation of damageable properties the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources one cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity or rate and impairment of quality and loss of valuable topsoil is the development or redevelopment of the land this division is adopted to accomplish the following objectives a to assure that development or redevelopment does not increase drainage or flood hazards or create unstable conditions susceptible to soil erosion b to protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff and soil erosion c to protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding and soil erosion on a watershed basis d to lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects repairs to flooddamaged public facilities and utilities correction of channel erosion problems and flood rescue and relief operations caused by stormwater runoff and soil erosion quantities from development or redevelopment e to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and soil water air animal and plant resources f to preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats g to preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to manage flood and stormwater impact improve water and groundwater quality reduce soil erosion protect aquatic and riparian habitats maintain quality forest resources provide recreational opportunities provide aesthetic benefits enhance community and economic development findings the st clair coil and water conservation district and the city of mascoutah hereby find as follows a the soil types found in st clair county illinois are susceptible to erosion and if left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property public safety and the environment b the topography of st clair county illinois contains areas with steep slopes upon which if clearing of trees andor inappropriate construction takes place could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in damage to property c excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainage ways and the creation of recreational facilities d the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles e soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washedout fills and embankments f sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes sinkholes wetlands and reservoirs g sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove h sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety  authority this division is enacted in accordance with the soil and water conservation districts act as found at 70 ilcs 1 et seq and specifically pursuant to the authority specified in of that act entitled adoption of land use regulations
