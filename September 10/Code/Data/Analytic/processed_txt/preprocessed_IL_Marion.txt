sterling codifiers inc  458460 1321 purpose and intent a the growth in and around the city and the associated development and construction of buildings paved surfaces roads and other improvements have altered in the past and continue to alter the natural flow of surface waters on the land which together with the construction of gutters culverts drains and channels for the carrying off of surface waters have both increased the quantity of stormwater and amplified the peak flow rates of runoff thus leading to present and potential flooding of property and homes dangerous flows within and over public roadways and streets and soil and channel erosion b it is the intention of the city council to protect the health and safety of the citizens and visitors of the community and to prevent damage to private property and public facilities proper design and construction of both on site and regional stormwater detention facilities that prevent or adequately reduce increases in peak flow rates of runoff that may otherwise increase the risk of flooding and associated risk of public endangerment property damage and erosion c it is the intention of the city council chapter to establish a water detention pond program for the design and construction of stormwater detention facilities so that where practical the most cost effective protection from flooding may be accomplished d it is the intention of the city council to protect the health and safety of the citizens of and visitors to the community and to prevent damage to private property and public facilities installation and use of temporary and permanent erosion control practices that prevent or adequately reduce increases in erosion and siltation that may otherwise increase the risk of flooding and the associated risk of
