improvementrepair has been reduced as far as reasonably possible  for example by means of the applicant entering into an installment payment arrangement with the contractor the administrator may grant

legally liable relatives may be asked to provide information regarding their income assets and basic living expenses that information will not be construed as an application for general assistance inasmuch as living persons are not eligible for burial assistance to clarify this point of law although legally liable relatives have a financial responsibility to pay for the burial or cremation of their relatives that financial responsibility only exists to the extent the legally liable relatives have a financial capacity to do so therefore legally liable relatives who are eligible for general assistance by virtue of their eligibility have no legal obligation to pay for the burial or cremation of their relatives for these reasons all general assistance issued for burial or cremation purposes shall be issued on behalf of and in the name of the deceased the financial responsibility of certain family members effective  grandparents parents children and grandchildren of the deceased

living expenses the administrator may also seek information from financial institutions holding assets of the deceased effective  maine law requires a financial institution to disclose the amount

overseer of the municipality or its agents stating that the named depositor is deceased consideration of the financial responsibility of family members generally when the administrator can make a finding that one or more of the deceaseds legally liable 81 relatives have an obvious and demonstrable financial capacity to pay for the burial or cremation by lump sum payment or by means of a reasonable payment arrangement the municipality will not grant the requested burial or cremation assistance when the administrator is unable to make such a finding the following proration of familial responsibility will be implemented proration of familial responsibility a proration of familial financial responsibility will be used when no legally liable relative possesses an obvious and demonstrable capacity to pay for the burial or cremation but one or more of the financially liable relatives is found to have a financial capacity to make a partial financial contribution or the administrator is unable to determine the financial capacity of one or more of said relatives under these circumstances each legally liable relative is considered to be responsible for his or her pro rata share of the total municipal contribution that would exist if no legally liable relatives had a financial capacity to contribute furthermore and as long as all other eligibility factors have been satisfied the municipality will provide as a burial or cremation benefit the aggregate of all pro rata shares less the share of any legally liable relative who refuses to cooperate with the

does not increase the developed area or building area by more than fifty 50 percent in any twelve 12 month period and ii the expansion does not require substantial demand for public water sewer and other services and iii the expansion does not constitute a change of use e change of use a change of use which is defined as conversion of an activity from one category in the land use table to another shall be required to obtain a new permit if the use requires a higher level of permitting ie from an allowed use to a permit by rule or conditional use permit or from a permit by rule to a conditional use a new permit would be required even if no building or structural changes are proposed fairfield land use a change of use which would require the provision of more parking spaces as
