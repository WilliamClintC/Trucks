status of the property in order to assess the risk for groundwater contamination potential for nonconforming uses a hazard ranking has been developed for various activities categorized by their standard industrial classification sic code this ranking is based on the kind of materials commonly associated with each use looking only at the most critical hydrologic factors table 1 following the text of this section lists the site hazard potential by land use activity on a scale of one to nine with one being a low hazard and nine a very high hazard this rating is based on the intrinsic hazards posed by different land uses and is related to the materials commonly used or stored on the site or the types and amounts of wastes commonly discharged table 2 lists the hazard potential determined on the basis of materials known to be used stored or disposed of at a specific site if the two tables referenced above indicate different site hazard potential ratings for the siccoded land
