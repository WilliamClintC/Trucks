purpose use and findings the city council finds and determines as follows a as recognized by both state and local law child care has become an increasingly important community service that is difficult for many families to secure due to lack of available facilities and spaces andor because of cost good quality child care services are an essential service for working parents and such child care facilities can contribute positively to a childs emotional cognitive and educational development the state has acknowledged the need for quality child care facilities in both the health and safety the government the citys general plan states that the city should encourage the availability of adequate convenient affordable child care that is accessible to all economic segments of the community b the purpose of this chapter is to create a child care facilities impact mitigation fee that will apply to new nonresidential development in the city this fee will further the public health safety and welfare by funding the construction of needed child care facilities in the city this chapter is thus consistent with both the states policy of encouraging quality child care facilities and with the citys general plan the city has the authority to enact the ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to of the california constitution and in accordance with the mitigation fee act government et seq c based on the findings of the city of palm desert the purpose of the child care facilities impact mitigation fee enacted by this chapter is to fund required capital improvements to

downtown districts design guidelines  purpose and applicability the design guidelines in this section provide direction for the design of buildings appurtenances and site elements the materials methods and forms herein are recommended alternative forms may be permitted when approved in writing by the director based on a finding that they conform to the design intent of this are otherwise required by law   building articulation guidelines a purpose this section defines recommended building articulation strategies and techniques to help ensure that new development is compatible with and contributes to the intended urban scale and character of each zone these design strategies and techniques enable the designer to manipulate the scale of buildings in addition to manipulating their size maximum building size standards are provided in the urban standards for each zone additional building scale guidelines are provided in the urban design criteria for that zone and this section provides additional guidance for meeting the intent of those design criteria these techniques are intended to help enable the design of buildings or building masses that may be larger in total width or height than neighboring buildings or the intended neighborhood scale by reducing the apparent mass and scale of the subject building these building articulation techniques need not be applied to buildings or building masses that are by their basic size and massing already consistent with the intended architectural scale for the applicable zone or urban context overarticulation of buildings can produce a cluttered and busy appearance that can be just as inappropriate as buildings with too little articulation these strategies are applied to the following fundamental building mass types as described in the following pages 1 block form 2 house form the success of the articulation proposed for any building will be reviewed by the architectural review commission taking into consideration the totality of the proposed development in relation to its immediate context and the intent of the applicable zone the massing of this mixeduse building is broken up by projecting corner balconies and chimney volumes that extend from the second floor residential units below the mass of this multifamily building is broken up with a gable that extends above the roof line and marks the entry into the unit building masses entrance porticos chimneys and corner windows project from the main mass of this multifamily building b blockform massing a blockform building is 1 to 5 stories tall attached to or attachable to buildings on neighboring properties with no intervening side yard or setback such buildingsbuilt at or near the street rightofway lineform a portion of a perimeter block the edges of which strongly define the urban space of the adjoining streets blockform buildings typically but not invariably have flat roofs with or without pitched roof design elements at the top of the street facade such buildings generally extend the full width of the lot and on wide lots have the potential to become significantly out of scale with their historic and existing urban context a series of basic building articulation techniques are illustrated at right by which the scale of block formbuildings may be moderated to contribute to the intended character of the applicable zone fig 25201a

the predominant facade plane of the building note that in city center or neighborhood center settings this technique of stepping the facade backward or forward is generally less effective than stepping the facade up or down see vertical articulation on following page a steady building line at the ground floor is often desirable in defining a walkable downtown street examples this mixeduse building on main street is set back from the buildings on either side of it a multistory mixeduse building set backs portions of its facade the orange mass of this mixeduse building is set back from the rest of the building further articulation is provided by second and thirdstory balconies 2 vertical articulation qpalmdesertcapalm desert 111 corridor formbased code161011_111_code_draft_rev_170117webresourcesimagema_block_form_21jpg to modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by stepping a portion of the streetfacing facade upward or downward from the predominant building height note that this technique offers the opportunity to organize a rather long building into multiple apparent buildings to avoid the appearance of a blocklong building this technique is also useful for stepping down the scale of a new building adjacent to an existing smaller building examples these buildings along main street are built at different heights adding variety to what would otherwise be a continuous wall a combination of a prominent corner tower and building masses with parapets and pitched roofs reduced the apparent size of this building a multifamily building where the massing is broken down into smaller volumes 3 architectural projections qpalmdesertcapalm desert 111 corridor formbased code161011_111_code_draft_rev_170117webresourcesimagema_block_form_31jpg to modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by the application of projected architectural elements from the plane of the facade note that this technique may be applied alone or in conjunction with other recommended articulation techniques this technique is best suited to smallscale adjustments of building scale whereas the building massing techniques on the previous pages are better suited to larger scale compatibility adjustments examples a mixeduse building with inset windows and decorative balconies upper floor balconies project from the corner of this mixeduse building threestory bay windows and balconies project from the facade of this mixeduse building 4 architectural recessions intent and technique to modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by the application of recessed architectural elements or spaces  such as a recessed porch covered passage or recessed balcony  is cut into the plane of the facade note that this technique has the potential to strongly define building entries to provide transitional spaces at those entries and in some cases to provide a lighter more open scale and character to building facades examples a thirdstory covered balcony along with second floor french balconies help articulate this 3story mixeduse building a recessed storefront accommodates covered outdoor seating the front facade of this 2story townhouse building is recessed to accommodate the front entries   frontage type guidelines a purpose frontages are critical to defining district character both in appearance and function frontages are comprised of the street facade of the buildings including any projecting elements and the landscape hardscape walls and fences of the front yard frontages provide an appropriate transition from the public environment of the street to the semiprivate and private environments of front yards and streetfacing ground floor spaces they also signal the location of the building entrance and provide a semipublic space within which neighbors and visitors can interact frontages can also help to screen any onsite parking areas b applicability the primary frontage of each building that faces a primary street or a park or other public space should be designed in conformance with the guidelines of this section c allowable frontage types all new buildings renovations that comprise 50% of the existing structure and additions that face the street should be designed to incorporate at least one of the frontage types allowed in that zone d requirements for all building frontages all buildings should provide at least 1 streetfacing primary pedestrian entry and streetfacing windows on all floors the frontage types herein may modify the configuration of those doors and windows but not replace them   shopfront a description shopfronts are large openings in the facade at or near the sidewalk enclosed with doors and transparent glass in a storefront assembly the primary shop entrance is at the grade of the sidewalk and provides direct access to the commercialretail uses on the ground floor the basic required architectural elements comprising the storefront are large windows doors with glass transom windows and a solid base bulkhead optional elements include awnings cantilevered shed roof or canopy signage lighting and cornices awnings or canopies may encroach into the public rightofway over the sidewalk extending to a distance within 2 feet of the face of curb primary street and side street setbacks if any are to be paved with a paving material that is consistent with or matches the adjacent sidewalk b design standards 1 storefront assemblies doors display windows bulkheads and associated framing should not be set back within the shopfront openings more than 2 feet  2 doors should match the materials design and character of the display window framing narrowline aluminum doors are prohibited 3 display windows a storefronts openings along the primary frontage should comprise at least 70% of the ground floor wall area b walls without openings should not exceed 10 linear feet along primary street frontages and 25 linear feet along side street frontages 4 storefront glass that is clear lightly tinted eg less than 15% low emissivity solar without reflective coating or dark tinting is encouraged instead frontage types such as arcades and galleries and architectural elements such as awnings and canopies are encouraged to shade shopfront openings 5 transom windows horizontal glass panels immediately above the storefront are encouraged glass in clerestory windows may be clear stained glass or frosted glass 6 bulkheads a storefront bulkheads should be of material similar or complementary to the main materials of the building and should be made of the same materials or materials that appear to be visually heavier than the adjacent walls b recommended materials include ceramic tile polished stone or glass tile 7 awning widths should correspond to storefront openings and shall not extend across the entire facade 8 new or renovated storefronts within historic buildings should consider emulating or recreating a previous storefront from historic photos or drawings in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture this can be flexibly interpreted for example when the general form of a new storefront is like the original but the materials are contemporary fig 25202 shopfront standards frontage element min max a1 height to top of transom clear 10 feet  16 feet  a2

contain groundfloor shopfronts making them ideal for retail or restaurant use as the arcade shelters the pedestrian while shading the storefront glass preventing glare that might obscure views of merchandise planter boxes or pots may be placed in between the columns to provide enclosure for such uses as cafe seating b design standards 1 along primary frontages the arcade column spacing should correspond to storefront openings 2 column height should be 4 to 5 times the column width column spacing and colonnade detailing including lighting should be consistent with the style of the building

are facades with ground floor colonnades that support a cantilevered shed roof or a deck that covers the sidewalk galleries contain ground floor storefronts making them ideal for retail use railing on top of the gallery is only required if the gallery roof is accessible as a deck planter boxes or pots may be placed in between columns to provide enclosure for such uses as cafe seating provided that adequate throughway access is maintained b design standards 1 galleries may be roofed provided the materials style and design are consistent with the building 2 galleries should be combined with the shopfront type  3 galleries may encroach over the sidewalk in the public rightofway subject to the issuance of an encroachment permit or license agreement prior to issuance of a building permit 4 column height should be four to five times the column width column spacing and colonnade detailing including lighting should be consistent with the style of the building to which it is attached 5

consistency with the plans goals for building form character and architectural quality some architectural elements are intended to project from the building face encroaching into building setback areas or in some cases into the public rightofway standards for such encroachments are provided in table 25182f architectural elements are intended to enliven building facades with human scale elements and spaces providing them with depth shade and shadow these elements provide facade articulation at an intermediate scale smaller than massing and larger than fenestration they help to express the character and style of the building purposefully and seamlessly integrated with the massing and fenestration not just stuck on to break up the mass building with second floor balconies

hydrologic topographic and climatic characteristics of the land the buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes such as for agricultural forestry outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  2001 variance procedure  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2001  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2001  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of chapters 2808 and 2810 of this title have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this title upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the governing body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this title to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this title the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title  2001 title 29 cultural resources purpose definitions cultural resources

preferential parking residential permit parking areas residential permit parking areas  legislative purpose this title is enacted in response to the serious adverse effects caused in certain areas and neighborhoods of the city by motor vehicle congestion particularly the longterm parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof who do not visit or conduct business with residents such parking by nonresidents threatens the health safety and welfare of all the residents of the city in order to protect these areas and neighborhoods it is necessary to enact parking regulations restricting parking by nonresidents therein while providing the opportunity for residents to park near their homes in these situations uniform parking regulations restricting residents and nonresidents alike would not serve the public interest rather such regulations would contribute to neighborhood decline while ignoring alternatives to automobile travel available to nonresidents who park in these areas for the reasons set forth in this chapter a system of preferential resident parking is enacted for the city  1998  legislative findings a general findings the city council finds that serious adverse effects in certain areas and neighborhoods of the city result from motor vehicle congestion particularly longterm parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof who do not visit or conduct business with residents the permit program established by this chapter will relieve these serious adverse
