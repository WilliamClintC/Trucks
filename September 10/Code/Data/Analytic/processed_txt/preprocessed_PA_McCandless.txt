the town of mccandless finds that 1 inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodcontrol efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources 2 a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 3 stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 4 federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes b in order to protect the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the town of mccandless as well as to protect sustain and enhance the surface water and groundwater resources of the town drainage and stormwater management practices shall be utilized as directed herein to achieve the following goals and objectives 1 accommodate site development and redevelopment in a manner that protects public safety and that is consistent with or reestablishes the natural hydrologic characteristics of each watershed and sustains groundwater recharge stream baseflows stable stream channel geomorphology conditions the carrying capacity of streams and their floodplains groundwater and surface water quality and aquatic living resources and their habitats 2 reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated 18editors note this ordinance also provided

and stream baseflows 4 maintain runoff characteristics of the site after completion of development that are consistent with the carrying capacity and stable channel conditions of the receiving streams 5 protect water quality by removing andor treating pollutants prior to discharge to groundwaters and surface waters throughout the town and protect restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological quality of groundwaters and surface waters 6 protect instream channels and geomorphology conditions of the receiving streams protect their floodcarrying capacity and aquatic habitats and reduce instream aggradation degradation and scour 7 reduce flooding impacts and prevent a significant increase in surface runoff rates and volumes predevelopment to postdevelopment which could worsen flooding downstream in the watershed enlarge floodplains erode stream banks and create other floodrelated healthwelfareproperty losses  in general preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying capacity of streams and their floodplains 8 protect adjacent lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater discharges 9 ensure effective longterm operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities 10 maintain natural drainage patterns and encourage the use of natural drainage systems 11 treat and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible using a minimum of structures and maximizing reliance on natural processes 12 maintain the existing water balance in all watersheds subwatersheds and streams in the town and protect andor restore

class i represents the least intense and class viii represents the most intense use permitted within the district each class has a series of corresponding regulations that govern the permitted levels of site development density of dwelling units requirements for site landscaping building heights open space and recreational land the specific categories are as follows 1 maximum density gross this pertains to residential uses only and is a measure of the total number of dwelling units permitted per acre within the d development district maximum density is the quotient of the total number of dwelling units divided by the base site area 2 maximum impervious surface ratio this is a measure of the land use intensity which is determined by dividing the total area of all impervious surfaces asphalt concrete building coverage or any other surface that does not permit water to penetrate into the ground by in the case of residential uses the base site area or in the case of nonresidential uses by net buildable site area 3 maximum floor area ratio far this is a measure of the maximum allowable floor area for a given land use and is determined by multiplying the far by the basic site area 4 site design standards there are far designations for these standards  r a b and c these standards are keys to 07 the site design standards specify the minimum requirements under these sections for all classes 5 maximum height feet this defines the permitted building height permissible within the d development district it is measured by taking the mean ground elevation along the perimeter of the building and calculating the height to the eave line of the roof in the case of a sloped roof or to the top of the roof structure for all other roofs enclosed spaces within roof forms above the permitted height shall remain as unoccupied spaces parapets screening walls mechanical penthouses and other architectural elements intended to screen andor shield rooftop mechanical equipment shall be

governed by the site capacity analysis this analysis is performed to determine the physical qualities of the site that are suitable for development the calculations required by this determine the site capacity pertain to both residential uses and nonresidential uses there are three basic steps in the site capacity analysis process which are as follows 1 determination of base site area  2 determination of sensitive natural resources which shall be preserved  residential uses only determination of recreational land to be provided  and 3 determination of site capacity the calculations establish the permissible intensity of development on a given site in the case of residential uses the analysis yields the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the site for both singlefamily and multifamily also the minimum required open space and land dedicated to recreation is determined in the case of nonresidential uses the maximum permissible impervious surface area see definitions  and the maximum permitted floor area are determined this information is then crossreferenced with the land use intensity class standards  to establish the appropriate classification for a proposed development these class standards also specify the site development requirements for the individual classes b base site area all land uses the first step in the determination of the site capacity is

use by having various shops and retail outlets available for proprietors employees and customers of and visitors to the offices the c8 district shall be broader in scope than the present c7 general office building district which is quite restrictive as to retail operations the primary use of this c8 district is intended for office space which shall comprise a minimum of 50% of the total available floors area it is contemplated that the c8 district would be an appropriate use of some of the property abutting the only limited access highway in the town mcknight road in view of the limited access nature of mcknight road within the town it is also the judgment of council that c3 highway commercial development in any form consisting of small individually developed parcels of land

served by a service road and individual commercial lot development would make the construction and installation of a service road impractical the c8 district shall therefore be limited to land
