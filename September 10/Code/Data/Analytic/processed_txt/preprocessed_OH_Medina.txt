thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter comparative no date c o 05 1882 3882 113502a3l 2982 41282

subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal

the applicantproperty owner should consider is provided with an illustration of the result of the design similarly a description is provided of the design approach that the applicantproperty owner should avoid when designing or remodeling structures in the overlay district aheight 1consider relating the overall height of new construction or renovation of existing structures to that of adjacent structures   images0003271jpg 2avoid new construction that greatly varies in height too high or too low from older buildings in the vicinity   images0003274jpg bscale 1consider relating the size and proportion of new structures to the scale of adjacent buildings although much larger than its neighbors in terms of square footage the building shown below maintains the same scale and rhythm as the existing buildings   images0003277jpg 2avoid buildings that in height width or massing violate the existing scale of the area the new building shown here disrupts the scale and rhythm of the streetscape   images0003280jpg cmassing 1consider breaking up uninteresting boxlike forms into smaller varied masses such as are common on most older buildings variety of form and massing are elements essential to the character of the streetscape   images0003283jpg 2avoid single monolithic forms that are not relieved by variations in massing boxlike facades and forms are intrusive when placed in a streetscape of older buildings that have varied massing and faade articulation   images0003286jpg ddirectional expression 1consider relating the vertical or nondirectional faade character of new buildings to the predominant directional expression of nearby buildings horizontal buildings can be made to relate to the more vertical adjacent structures by breaking the faade into smaller masses that conform to the primary expression of that streetscape   images0003289jpg 2avoid strongly horizontal or vertical faade expressions unless compatible with the character of structures in the immediate area the new building shown does not relate well to either its neighbors or to the rhythm of the streetscape because of its unbroken horizontal faade   images0003292jpg esetback 1consider maintaining the architectural faade lines of streetscape by locating front walls of new buildings in the same plane as facades of adjacent buildings if existing setbacks vary the new building should conform to historic siting patterns   images0003295jpg 2avoid violating the existing setback pattern by placing new buildings in front of or behind the historic faade line avoid placing buildings at odd angles to the street unless in an area where diverse siting already exists   images0003298jpg fsense of entry 1consider articulating the main entrances to the building with covered porches porticos and other pronounced architectural forms   images0003301jpg 2avoid facades with no strong sense of entry side entries or entries not defined by a porch or similar transitional element result in an incompatible flat first floor faade   images0003304jpg groof shapes 1consider relating the roof forms of the new building to those found in the area although not entirely necessary duplication of the existing or traditional roof shapes pitches and materials on new construction is one way of making new structures more visually compatible   images0003307jpg 2avoid introducing roof shapes pitches or materials not traditionally used in the area   images0003310jpg hrhythm of openings 1consider respecting the recurrent alternation of wall area with door and window elements in the faade also consider the widthtoheight ratio of bays in the faade the placement of openings with respect to the faades overall composition symmetry or balances asymmetry should be carefully studied   images0003313jpg 2avoid introducing incompatible faade patterns that upset the rhythm of openings established in the surrounding structures glass walls and window and door shapes and their locations shown in the examples are disrespectful to the adjoining buildings   images0003316jpg passed 62314 title three  subdivision regulations chap 1161 general provisions and penalty chap 1163 definitions
