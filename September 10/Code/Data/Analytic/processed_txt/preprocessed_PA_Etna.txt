improve the runoff conditions for redevelopment refer to  51816c3 the design goals are to 1 minimize the volume of runoff that must be collected conveyed treated and released by stormwater management facilities  note minimization of runoff generated by a proposed site is directly related to the various land use and design standards for site improvements required under the municipal zoning and subdivision and land development ordinances the effect that these requirements have on generating stormwater should be taken into consideration site design should implement runoff reduction techniques such as those described in appendix b45 2 maintain the natural infiltration process and rate and infiltrate runoff at its source when appropriate  3 remove andor treat pollutants at the source or during conveyance  4 provide for peak flow attenuation as needed  and 5 attenuate runoff to protect the instream channel of the receiving stream b general principles the following general principles apply to all applicable activities pursuant to  5184 1 incorporate conservation design practices to minimize the amount of stormwater generated on a site encourage the disconnection of impervious land cover and maximize the use of pervious areas for stormwater treatment and onsite rainfall infiltration note design standards in other sections of the municipal subdivision and land development ordinance should be evaluated for their impact on generating stormwater runoff for example standards for parking stall sizes quantity of parking roadway widths yard and bulk area requirements for each zoning district can inadvertently work against the minimization of stormwater generated also pervious areas such as recreation fields may be available for the installation of stormwater facilities thereby maximizing the use of pervious areas a brief description of suggested site design practices is provided in appendix b46 2 infiltration of surface water runoff at its source is to be a mechanism for stormwater management based on hydrologic soil group or infiltration testing infiltration practices include but are not limited to those referenced in  51818b1 and as outlined in the

consider minimum disturbanceminimum maintenance techniques combined with site grading that distributes runoff to reduce concentration next applicants shall consider depression areas combined with subsurface infiltration practices followed by other subsurface measures including but not limited to porous paving and perforated pipe storage c the use of multiple infiltration features and facilities that provide for the following is encouraged  discourage concentration of flows   encourage disconnection of flows   infiltrate as close to the source of runoff as possible  and  reduce visual impact note an example of promoting the concepts listed in  51816b2c is choosing a design method to address runoff collected from rooftops and conveyed to the surface by downspouts the disconnection of flows can be accomplished by directing the downspouts over pervious surfaces rather than impervious surfaces this can be taken one step further by directing the downspouts into infiltration facilities close to the source of the runoff this promotes the idea of infiltrating as close to the source of runoff as possible and discourages the concentration of flows d where high water tables subsurface contamination slope stability concerns or other site constraints preclude achieving the required infiltration volume additional conservation design practices and alternative stormwater management practices should be implemented to reduce to the maximum extent practicable the total volume of stormwater released to streams applicant shall follow the stormwater runoff hierarchy of  51818a1 e infiltration areas should be designed to maintain any broad and even infiltration pattern which existed prior to development such facilities should use the natural topography and vegetation in order to blend in with the site infiltration designs which do not provide this may be used if the applicant demonstrates to the municipalitys satisfaction that alternative approaches would be more effective more harmonious with their existing environment and as easily maintained  51816 etna code  51816  f aboveground stormwater infiltration facilities should be as shallow as

accordingly such landscaping can contribute to the effectiveness of the facility to hold and filter water as well the standards listed below are an example of the type of landscaping practices that might be required also note that these standards relate specifically to structural facilities  other types of management strategies including riparian buffers constructed wetlands etc may need landscaping and enhancement standards as well any such alternative will be as effective and as easily maintained periodic cleaning of these systems shall be addressed in the operations and maintenance plan submitted to the municipality note municipalities may wish to expand on the types of stormwater practices listed above only the general categories of stormwater management practices are covered in this chapter for example it is recommended that sections be added on porous paving water quality inlets bioretention rain barrels and sand filters to name a few on the other hand the design and construction of many stormwater management practices evolves over time and some municipalities may wish to list only the general categories for that purpose but provide for other techniques in accordance with new design manuals etc also riparian corridors and other native plant landscaping can provide a valuable stormwater management benefit and should be addressed but may best be implemented separate ordinance a landscaping shall be required in and around all constructed stormwater management facilities with a minimum surface area of 1000 square feet for the purposes of 1 assisting in the management of stormwater  2 stabilizing the soil within such facilities to minimize and control erosion  3 enhancing the visual appearance of such facilities  and 4 mitigating maintenance problems commonly associated with the creation of such facilities b a planting plan and planting schedule shall be submitted in accordance with the following 1 wet meadows including floors of stormwater management facilities a wet meadows and floors of stormwater management facilities shall be planted with noninvasive plants native to western pennsylvania such as wildflowers and noninvasive grasses the  51818 etna code  51819  intent being to create a mixed meadow of such plantings where appropriate selection of plantings shall be based on whether the area in question is usually well drained or permanently wet and whether the area will be used for recreation purposes no woody plants shall be planted within the saturated zone phreatic line of a stormwater management practice or on a berm constructed for impounded water b seeding by drills corrugated rollers cyclone or drop seeders or hand seeding of such areas is preferred  however hydroseeding followed by

does not exceed plant uptake soil for planting of wildflowers shall contain not less than 3% or more than 10% organic matter as determined by an agricultural chemist with certification of the test before planting d seeding shall take place either between april 1 and may 15 or between september 1 and october 15 planting areas shall be soaked to maintain a consistent level of moisture for at least four to six weeks after planting for seeding recommendations reference the deps e&s pollution control program manual e once established a single annual mowing when plants are dormant should be sufficient to maintain a wet meadow andor floor of a stormwater management practice 2 wet edges that remain wet all or most of the year shall be planted with wildflowers grasses and shrubs plants to be located on rims or banks which remain dry most of the year shall be planted with species tolerant of dry soil conditions 3 wooded areas a where stormwater management facilities adjoin wooded areas trees and shrubs shall be selected and planted outside the practice so as to blend with existing surroundings b plantings in such areas shall be of sufficient density to eliminate the need for mowing c it is recommended that clusters of trees and shrubs be planted around stormwater management facilities but well away from outfalls and any constructed berms where applicable to provide for wildlife habitat wind control and buffering and screening d vegetation shall be planted during appropriate times of the year predominantly between late march and mid may or from  51819 general provisions  51819   51820 stream buffer requirements early october until evidence of ground freezing depending upon the species selected most deciduous trees and shrubs can be planted in either spring or fall evergreens are best planted in late summer or early fall 4 slopes a where slopes are gentle a mixture of meadow grasses and wildflowers for wet meadows shall be planted b on steep slopes as defined by the municipalitys code of ordinances dense spreading shrubs shrubs tolerant of dry soils shall be planted heavy mat mulch shall be used during the period of establishment c no woody plant materials or trees shall be located on a constructed or natural berm acting as the impoundment structure of a stormwater management practice trees shall be located downstream of an impoundment berm a sufficient distance from the toe of the constructed slope to assure that the toe of the slope is outside the dripline of the species planted at maturity but in no case less than 15 feet 5 in cases where stormwater management facilities are to be located in proximity to wetlands or waterways the applicants planting plan and schedule shall consider the sensitive conditions existing therein and be modified accordingly to reflect existing flora 6 stormwater management facilities shall be screened in a manner which complements the existing landscape and provides sufficient access for maintenance a stream buffers shall be provided for new development sites as per the following requirements 1 a minimum stream buffer width of 50 feet landward in each direction from the top of stream banks is

extend beyond the edge of the required buffer width the buffer shall be adjusted so that the buffer consists of the extent of the wetland plus a twentyfivefoot zone extending beyond the wetland edge d stream buffer averaging may be applied to account for encroachments such as road crossings the following criteria must be met in order to utilize buffer averaging on a development site  51819 etna code  51820   51821 volume controls the green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the bmp manual found in  51836 shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible water volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in or the simplified method in below or alternative design criteria as allowed by title 25 pa  1 buffer averaging is required for water quality buffers that have stream crossings 2 an overall average buffer width of at least 50 feet must be achieved within the boundaries of the property to be developed stream buffer corridors on adjoining properties cannot be included with buffer averaging on a separate property even if owned by the same property owner 3 the average width must be calculated based upon the entire length of stream bank that is located within the boundaries of the property to be developed when calculating the buffer length the natural stream channel should be followed 4 stream buffer averaging shall be applied to each side of a stream independently if the property being developed encompasses both sides of a stream buffer averaging can be applied to both sides of the stream but must be applied to both sides of the stream independently 5 on each stream bank the total width of the buffer shall not be less than 25 feet at any location except at approved stream crossings those areas of the buffer having a minimum width of 25 feet or less at approved stream crossings can comprise no more than 50% of the buffer length e stream buffer locations and widths should be illustrated on all subdivision plans with notations requiring that they be maintained in a natural state f stream buffers should be illustrated on all grading and erosion and sedimentation control plans the defined stream buffer location should be properly recorded the recording should provide a plan illustrating the stream buffer location width and the requirement that it be maintained in a natural state a the design storm method cg1 in the bmp manual found in  51836 is applicable as a method to any size of regulated activity this method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions the following shall be incorporated into the cg1 method  51820 general provisions  51821   51822 rate controls 1 do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the twoyear twentyfourhour duration precipitation 2 for modeling purposes a existing predevelopment nonforested pervious areas must be considered meadow in good condition  20% of existing impervious area when present shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions b the simplified method cg2 in the bmp manual found in  51836 provided below is independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not followed this method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities for new impervious surfaces 1 stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces 2 at least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow ie it shall not be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth removal options include reuse evaporation transpiration and infiltration 3 wherever possible infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff  however in all cases at least the first 05 inch of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated 4 this method is exempt from the requirements of  51822 rate controls a for areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved act 167 stormwater management plan 1 postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the one two five ten twentyfive fifty and onehundredyear twentyfourhour storm events this is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to those rates shown in the maps contained in appendix a new and existing release rate management districts50 this predevelopment to postdevelopment control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the conditional direct discharge areas on the release rate maps if it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the 50editors note appendix a is an attachment to this chapter  51821 etna code  51822   51823 riparian buffers predevelopment analysis for one two five ten twentyfive fifty and onehundredyear twentyfourhour storms then the requirements of this section have been met otherwise the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement b for areas covered by a release rate map from an approved act 167 stormwater management plan 1 for the one two five ten twentyfive fifty and onehundredyear twentyfourhour storm events the postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps these maps are contained in appendix a new and existing release rate management districts of this ordinance for any areas not shown on the release rate maps the postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the specified design events peak flows should be computed using the methods included in of the padep stormwater management bmp
