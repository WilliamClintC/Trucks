next ten 10 years if permitted residential densities in undeveloped land along the peripheries of the city should materialize if the anticipated use of the planned unit development occurs too frequently and if probable annexations take place in the imminent future the rather considerable input from citizens  some solicited most volunteered  conforms to the conclusions also reached by the city council that the city of frankenmuth would probably destroy its own best potential if it grew too rapidly the main considerations prompting such a conclusion are 1 the fiscal ability or inability of the city to properly extend utilities facilities improvements to such expanded areas commensurate with rational municipal service costs  2 the obvious perversion or distortion of the environment heretofore successfully and historically developed over the past one hundred forty 140 years to the present desirable social and economic level  3 assuring preservation of the green belt and rural environment so essential to the character of the combined community of township and city it is an obvious fact that village size and bavarianfranconian architectural features enhance the dorf or village image which attracts the continued interest of the tourist and increases the economic stability of the community it follows also that the historical integrity which forms the basis of this citys attraction and reputation would also be less visible and authentic if a doubling or tripling of the population were permitted in too short a period because of its heritage as well as its unique crafts and services frankenmuth brings tourists into eastern michigan and saginaw county frankenmuth is a historical as well as a rural island surrounded by urban centers that are destined in time and with lack of appropriate heed to ultimately overtake engulf and compromise the positive and desirable characteristics which so favorably distinguish this community from most others within its region and state therefore in the effort to preserve and maintain the quality of life so carefully nurtured by all of its citizens as well as its community leaders and government officials it is deemed necessary to herewith decree and ordain that from the date of enactment of this such time as it may be amended or rescinded the population of the city of frankenmuth michigan zoning & planning of
