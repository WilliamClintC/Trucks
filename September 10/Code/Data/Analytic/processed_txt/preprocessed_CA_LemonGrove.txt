of the public in examining this requirement the planning commission will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring in addition future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood

applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section  2007    variance procedure a nature of variances 1 the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature though these standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in general a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2 it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeals board 1 the planning commission shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter 2 the planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 3 in passing upon such applications the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 4 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that i the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and ii such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the san diego county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 5 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as defined in this chapter considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5 variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances as defined in this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 c5 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety 7 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b3 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  2007   transportation uniform mitigation fee program  title this chapter shall be known as the lemon grove regional transportation congestion improvement program  2008  findings in adopting this chapter the city council of the city of lemon grove finds and determines that a the city is a member agency of the san diego association of governments sandag a joint powers agency consisting of the city the county of san diego and the seventeen other cities situated in san diego county acting in concert the member agencies of sandag developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional arterial system of highways and arterials in san diego county the regional arterial system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development as a member agency of sandag the city participated in the preparation of a certain rtcip impact fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act b the city council has been informed and advised and finds that future development within san diego county and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists c the city council has been further informed and advised and finds that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of san diego county and the city with unacceptable levels of service throughout san diego county by 2030 d the city council has been further advised and so finds that funding in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the nexus study will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system absent implementation of a regional transportation improvement plan rtcip fee based on the nexus study existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around san diego county and the city e the city council has reviewed the nexus study and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service f the city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within san diego county and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health safety and welfare g the city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the rtcip fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the rtcip fee will be levied h the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the rtcip fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the rtcip fee i the city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements and that the amount of the rtcip fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development j the city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system and that rtcip fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs k the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the nexus study the need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements l the city council finds that the nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system m the city council adopts the nexus study and incorporates it in this chapter as though set forth in full

making determinations as to the consistency of the various zoning districts with the general plan land use categories a to the greatest degree possible zoning districts shall be established in areas with corresponding general plan land use designations for example the residential low density or rl district should be applied in those area designated by the general plan as low density residential and the heavy commercial or hc district should be applied to those areas designated by the general plan for heavy commercial use b no zoning district shall be applied where the districts permitted uses would be more intensive than those indicated by the general plan high density residential development is more intensive than low density residential development and commercial and industrial development are more intensive than residential development c zoning districts which permit lower intensity use shall not be applied in area designated by the general plan for higher intensity use if the lower intensity use would generally preclude the establishment of a higher intensity use for example the residential low density or rl district should not be applied in those areas where the general plan has indicated that higher density development would be desirable and indeed should be encouraged  the construction of singlefamily dwelling in these areas would most probably eliminate the possibility of constructing higher density development on the same site  general plan amendment any amendment to the lemon grove general plan shall be adopted in the manner provided in this
