the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted to lessen the threat to public health safety or welfare of soil erosion and sediment control sought by the enactment of this ordinance b excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainage ways and the creation of recreational facilities  c the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  d soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washedout fills and embankments  e sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  f sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and g sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety 8 102 purpose the village of machesney park therefore declares that the purpose of this ordinance is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the 82 public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village of machesney park it is the intention of this ordinance that the transport of sediment via wind or rainwater runoff from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited as closely as practicable to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its undisturbed state the management practices controls and other provisions contained in an erosion and sediment control plan must be at

following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under this ordinance 85 a development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and existing contours should be followed as closely as possible b natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to existing watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossings of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures c special precautions should be taken to prevent damages that occur due to any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventative measures must be commensurate with the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation d the smallest practical area of disturbance should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development e sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriated sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to control and remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
