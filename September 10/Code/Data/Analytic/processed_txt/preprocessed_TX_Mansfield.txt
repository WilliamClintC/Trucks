plan  5435 introduction and objectives ahaving a dependable water supply has always been a key issue in the development of texas the growing population and economic expansion occurring in north central texas are placing increased demands on our water supplies in order to meet the challenge of providing for our current and future needs we must learn to use the water we already have more efficiently by stretching our existing supplies we can delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new water resources and postpone the high cost of building the infrastructure dams treatment facilities and pipelines necessary to capture treat and transport the additional water into our homes and businesses brecognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation plans for public water suppliers tceq guidelines and requirements are included in appendix a the city of mansfield has developed this water conservation plan in response to tceq guidelines and requirements cthe objectives of this water conservation plan are as follows 1to reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts 2to reduce the loss and waste of water 3to improve efficiency in the use of water 4to extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand 5to educate the citizens of mansfield about the need for water conservation and the benefits of conserving our most valued natural resource passed 42914  5436 texas commission on environmental quality rules athe tceq rules governing development of water conservation plans for public water suppliers are contained in tex admin subchapter a rule 2882 which is included in appendix b for the purpose of these rules a water conservation plan is defined as a strategy or combination of

conservation goals for a water conservation plan as part of plan adoption each customer will develop fiveyear and tenyear goals for per capita municipal use following tceq procedures described in the water utility profile appendix b the goals for this water conservation plan include the following akeep the per capita municipal water use below 158 gallons per capita per day in 2018 fiveyear goal and 155 gallons per capita per day in 2023 tenyear goal  bkeep the level of unaccounted water in the system below 10% annually in 2014 and subsequent years as discussed in  5439d  cimplement and maintain a program of universal metering and meter replacement and repair as discussed in  5439 b  ddecrease waste in lawn irrigation by implementation and enforcement of landscape water management

passed 42914  5439 metering water use records control of unaccounted water and leak detection and repair one of the key elements in water conservation is careful tracking of water use and control of losses diversions and leaks careful metering of water deliveries and water use detection and repair of leaks in the distribution system and regular monitoring of unaccounted water are important in controlling losses aaccurate metering of treated water deliveries the metering devices that measure raw water delivered to the city of mansfield texas will be maintained within a minimum of + 5% accuracy the largest raw water meter is located at the water treatment plant this meter is an endress hauser promag w which has an accuracy range of + 05% bmetering of customer and public uses and meter testing repair and replacement all connections to the water system are metered connections all meters will be maintained within an acceptable operating accuracy range as defined by the manufacturer or awwa standard for meter accuracy which ever is more stringent dead meters and meters that indicate reduced usage will be flagged during the computerized billing process these meters will be checked field tested and replaced when found to be out of manufacturer specifications or not meeting awwa standards crecord management system 1as required by tex admin subchapter a rule 2882a2b the record management system allows for the separation of water sales and uses into residential commercial publicinstitutional and industrial categories this information will be included in an

underreport actual use  blosses due to water main breaks and leaks in the water distribution system  closses due to illegal connections and theft  and dother 2the city will continue to monitor and minimize unaccounted water use by  periodic visual field inspection of all water facilities use of fire hydrant meters to quantify the volume of water lost during flushing review of property occupancy and monthly comparisons of historical metered usage additional measures will be taken at the water treatment plant to quantify process water 3as shown in the water utility profile unaccounted water has varied from 75% to 139% in the last five years with the measures described in this plan the city intends to maintain the unaccounted water below 10% in 2014 and subsequent years eleak detection and repair 1the city will continue to vigilantly monitor the water distribution system and customer service connections for water leaks and address the repair of any leaks found in a manner that expeditiously stops water loss all leaks will be isolated and repaired as soon as possible 2meter readers watch for and report signs of illegal connections so they can be addressed quickly crews and personnel look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system maintenance crews respond quickly to repair leaks reported by the public and city personnel the city uses two threeman

effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 4813  15103 approved plats platted lots approved prior to the adoption of this chapter with minimum

methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
