safest access to properties based on roadway characteristics and any physical constraints to access occasionally a lot is adjacent to more than one street in such cases the following requirements shall be observed in identifying the front lot line the following figure provides graphic illustration to the following provisions a when a lot exists between two developed lots which both abut the same street the front lot line shall be on the same street as the existing developed lots on either side b when a lot is adjacent to vacant lots or developed lots which abut either street the following criteria shall apply 1 where one street is of a higher classification than the other the lot line fronting the street with the lower classification shall be the front lot line 2 if the lot in question is a corner lot and both streets are of the same classification the narrower of the two frontages shall be designated the front lot line 3 the director of community development shall make the determination when the above criteria cannot be clearly applied to the particular situation as a result of topography or other factors c the front lot line for a corner lot or a reverse corner lot is the lot line which fronts the street with the lower classification if both streets are of the same classification the narrower of the two frontages shall be designated the front lot line except in those cases where the subdivision or parcel map specifies another line as the front lot line for example as shown on the corner lot in exhibit c line a is the proposed front lot line because line a fronts a street with a lower classification and because line a is shorter than line b d the front lot line for a flag lot is the shorter of the two perpendicular lot lines that radiate from the end of the pole portion of the lot for example as shown on the flag lot in exhibit  cd line c is the front lot line because it is shorter than line d when the two lot lines radiating from the end of the pole portion of a flag lot are at an obtuse or acute angle as shown in exhibit d then the front lot line is a midpoint located at the end of the pole portion the front yard for such a lot is formed by plotting an imaginary arch starting at the midpoint and extending for a distance equal to the minimum front yard setback for the zoning district in which the lot is located e the front lot line for a culdesac lot is that lot line which abuts the edge of the public rightofway or private access easement way from which primary lot access occurs added by 2393  amended by 1396 of front lot lines a c

defined in this zoning c character of accessway use 1 pass and repass refers to the right of the public to walk and run along an accessway because this use limitation can substantially restrict the publics ability to enjoy adjacent publicly owned tidelands by restricting the potential use of lateral accessways it will be applied only in connection with vertical access or other types of access where the findings required by a5 and a5d establish that the limitation is necessary to protect natural habitat values topographic features such as eroding bluffs or privacy of the landowner 2 passive recreational use as used in this section passive recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct activities normally associated with beach use such as walking swimming jogging sunbathing fishing surfing picnicking but not including organized sports campfires or vehicular access other than for emergencies or maintenance 3 active recreational use as used in this section active recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct the full range of beachoriented activities not including horseback riding and use of motorized vehicles unless specifically authorized 3

in a3b an offer to dedicate an easement or other legal mechanism pursuant to a4j2 for one or more of the types of access identified in a2d1 a2d5 shall be required and shall be supported by findings required by a5a a5c  provided that no such condition of approval for coastal access shall be imposed if the analysis required by a5a1 a5a4 establishes that the development will not adversely affect either individually or cumulatively the ability of the public to reach and use public tidelands and coastal resources or that the access dedication requirement will not alleviate the access burdens identified 1 new development on any parcel or location specifically identified in the certified land use plan or in the lcp zoning districts 2 new development between the nearest public roadway and the sea 3 new development on any site where there is substantial evidence of a public right of access to the sea acquired or a public right of access authorization 4 new development on any site where

the public with the permanent right of lateral public access and passive recreational use along the shoreline or public recreational area bikeway or blufftop area as applicable  provided that in some cases controls on the time place and manner of uses may be justified by site characteristics including sensitive habitat values or fragile topographic features or by the need to protect the privacy of residential development located immediately adjacent to the accessway 2 active recreational use may be appropriate in many cases where the development is determined to be especially burdensome on public access examples include cases where the burdens of the proposed project would severely impact public recreational use of the shoreline where the proposed development is not one of the priority uses specified in public resources the policies of the certified land use plan where active recreational uses reflect the historic public use of the site where active recreational uses would be consistent with the use of the proposed project and where such uses would not significantly interfere with the privacy of the landowner in determining the appropriate character of public use findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in a5b lateral access shall be legally described as required in a4g b vertical public access minimum requirements 1 a condition to require vertical public access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit or other authorization to proceed with development pursuant to a3a shall provide the public with the permanent right of access

be legally described as required in a4g the access easement shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide if a residential structure is proposed the accessway should not be sited closer than 10 feet or another distance if specified in the certified land use plan to the structure c bluff top access minimum requirements 1 a condition to require public access along a bluff top as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit or other authorization to proceed with development pursuant to a3a shall provide the public with the permanent right of scenic and visual access from the bluff top to the public tidelands  provided that in some cases controls on the time place and manner of uses may be justified by site characteristics including sensitive habitat values or fragile topographic features or by the need to protect the privacy of residential development located immediately adjacent to the accessway 2 the bluff top access shall be limited to passive recreational use and coastal viewing purposes unless another character of use is specified as a condition of development in determining the appropriate character of use findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in a5b 3 each bluff top accessway shall be described in the conditions of approval of the coastal development permit as an area beginning at the current bluff edge extending 25 feet inland or an area which allows for 50 years of bluff erosion or another standard determined to be necessary for public safety andor geologic stability whichever results in the greatest width of the bluff top accessway however the accessway shall not extend any closer than 10 feet from an occupied residential structure due to the potential for erosion of the bluff edge the condition shall include a mechanism that will cause the accessway to be adjusted inland as the edge recedes any permanent improvements should be set back from the accessway by a distance derived by multiplying the annual rate of blufftop retreat by the life expectancy in years of the permanent improvements 4 the accessway shall be legally described as required in a4g with the furthest inland extent of the area possible referenced as a distance from a fixed monument in the following manner such easement shall be insert appropriate distance as described in a4c3 above feet wide located along the bluff top as measured inland from the

access and recreation policies of the lcp and coastal act consistent with other provisions of this chapter  provided that in some cases controls on the time place and manner of uses may be justified by site characteristics including sensitive habitat values or fragile topographic features or by the need to protect the privacy of residential development located immediately adjacent to the accessway in determining if another character of use is appropriate findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in a5b the trail access shall be legally described as required by a4g e

topic has been modified view the section for details  intent and purpose the three 3 floodplain overlay fp districts protect the public health safety and general welfare from flood hazards by assuring proper use and development the fp1 district is applied to areas shown as floodway areas on the fema flood insurance rate map firm as floodway on the other areas in which the city has determined that a floodway exists the fp2 district is applied to areas inundated by 100 year flood which are shown as a a1 a30 ao ah a99 and m on fema flood insurance rate maps and areas in which the city has determined to be a special flood hazard area the fp3 district is applied to coastal areas subject to wave action which are specifically shown as ae e ve v and v1 v30 on the fema flood insurance rate maps and areas in which the city has determined to be a coastal high hazard area the floodplain overlay districts are overlay districts which may be combined with any other zoning district the floodplain overlay districts provide use development and permit requirements that are applied in addition to the underlying zoning district and the requirements of other overlay districts in the event of conflicting provisions between the underlying district and the overlay districts the more restrictive requirements shall prevail the purposes of the floodplain overlay districts include a the floodplain overlay districts and the flood hazard areas of the city of dana point are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative
