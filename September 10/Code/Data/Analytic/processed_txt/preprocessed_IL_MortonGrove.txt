mile 1320 feet ten percent 10% parking reduction 3 fundamental design principals of developments in cr district this zoning district is intended to encourage the creation of a vibrant mixed use neighborhood that allows for convenient access to local businesses and the metra station while giving priority to pedestrians and residents developments within this district should be designed to make a synergistic contribution to the district as a whole the following fundamental principals have been developed to better achieve this community goal a create appropriately scaled streetwall for commercial areas the streetwall is the vertical plane that defines the wall of the public space street and sidewalks the streetwall is typically created by multiple adjacent buildings on each block both sides of the street should be considered when establishing the streetwall to create a comfortable human scale public space the height of the buildings should be greater than the width of the street provided that such building height is compatible with adjacent buildings b create continuous streetwall the streetwall should be continuous to avoid empty spaces accordingly gaps between buildings should be less than the width of the building the public space of the street and sidewalk should be formed by the buildings rather than be considered leftover space c parking location surface parking should be located behind buildings to avoid disrupting the pedestrian nature of the streetwall d visually appealing streetwall the building design should be oriented to the pedestrian nature of the district this can be accomplished by articulating the face of the building or incorporating architectural elements that are recessed inward or projected outward from the primary face of the building landscaping can also contribute to the streetwall long stretches of blank windowless walls at grade are to be avoided e anchor corners developments which are constructed at intersections with two 2 streets should anchor the corners of the buildings in close proximity to those intersections this is vital to creating the streetwall as it provides scale to the intersection and reduces the amount of paving and empty space f establish uniform building line for streetwall buildings should be set back at the appropriate distance to create a relatively continuous line to succeed in creating the streetwall and an interesting safe pedestrian path along the street each block and area of the cr district will be unique in terms of the appropriate setback to create the desired streetwall g focused views site plans and building design should be arranged to create focal points to guide travelers around corners and draw them farther down the street h location of primary entrances the primary entrance to individual buildings should be located on the primary rather than secondary street driveways and services should be located on secondary streets or alleys to give priority to pedestrians on the primary streets i contribution to an interesting pedestrian zone developments in the cr district should provide a comfortable and safe route for pedestrians conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles are to be avoided sidewalks adjacent to commercial space should be wider than five feet 5 to allow for future streetscaping public art and outdoor seating buffers such as parkways with trees should separate sidewalks from the street on street parking can also serve as an effective buffer at times j parking and garage placement surface parking lots shall not be located in front of buildings facing a public street parking areas must be located to the side or rear of buildings access to garages shall be from an alley private drive located to the side or rear of a building garage access from lincoln avenue is discouraged in the cr district if structured parking is provided on the ground floor of mixeduse and commercial buildings parking shall be prohibited within fifty feet 50 of lincoln avenue to ensure adequate commercial space on lincoln avenue k faade transparency for commercial and mixed uses at least 50% of the wall area that is between 2 and 12 feet above grade shall be occupied by windows andor entry doors these windows and doors shall meet the following requirements i utilize clear transparent glass in order to provide clear views of building interiors from the street and to allow natural surveillance of the street and adjacent outdoor spaces ii tint internal screening patterns or mirrored coatings are prohibited iii coatings shall be limited to those necessary to meet the minimum ufactor requirement in the latest addition of the international energy conservation by the state of illinois iv be of commercial grade and
