handbook or as subsequently amended satisfy the requirements of of the stow zoning bylaw and related subdivision rules and regulations site plan approval rules and regulations and special permit rules and regulations and therefore are presumed to also satisfy other regulatory requirements as stated in said handbook  stormwater management the objective of stormwater management for stow is to design a system in such a way so that the volume and peak runoff from the development of a parcel will be no greater after the development is completed than it was before the development was started and that the water quality will meet required department of environmental protection dep standards town of stow rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land   stormwater management requirements the

requirements the planning board review process may set more stringent requirements than are specified in the handbook the planning board may require subdivisions of any size as well as special permit applications and site plans to be compliant with the handbook the planning board adopts the requirements of the stormwater management standards listed in the handbook  best management practice bmp

stormwater management system prior to submission of a definitive plan in the preliminary design plan the applicant shall be prepared to discuss and justify the design approach for stormwater

prevention and construction period erosion and sediment control implement nonstructural measures to prevent pollution or control it at its source  and c structural bmps physical devices typically designed and constructed to trap or filter pollutants from runoff or to reduce runoff velocities design construct and maintain structural bmps to attenuate peak flows capture and treat runoff and
