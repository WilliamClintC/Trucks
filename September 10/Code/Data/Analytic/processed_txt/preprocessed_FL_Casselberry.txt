establishment seminole county florida the county in which the city of casselberry is located matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to all related ordinances and other matters and documents relating to all of the above  the city commission finds 1 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state of florida 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains in a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printer material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments

commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in central florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit central florida attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31 in order to reverse urban blight the city of casselberry has established a community redevelopment area pursuant to fs ch 163 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments that contribute to urban blight operate at crosspurposes with community redevelopment areas 32 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 33 physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 34 in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 35 the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 36 requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 37 reserved 38 straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 39 workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of fs ch 796 operation without occupational licenses and illegal and unlicensed massage 40 physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases 41 the practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 42 sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 43 requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 44 this not be construed as opting

soliciting on public and private property legislative findings the city commission recognizes a constitutional right to beg panhandle or solicit in a peaceful and nonthreatening manner the city commission finds however that an increase in aggressive begging panhandling or soliciting throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder aggressive begging panhandling or soliciting usually includes approaching or following pedestrians repetitive begging panhandling or soliciting despite refusals the use of abusive or profane language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city commission further finds that the presence of persons who solicit money from other persons at or near outdoor cafes automated teller machines the entrance and exits of buildings certain public events as more particularly described in this payphones is especially troublesome because said persons cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property the city commission further finds that the activity of begging panhandling or soliciting presents significant public health welfare and safety concerns and crowd control problems when such activities are conducted on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic because these activities involve the process of a person requesting a donation from an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is in traffic that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the request and if the vehicle occupant or operator decides to fulfill the request that person must reach for a wallet search for money or write a check all while that person and vehicle are located on a public street in use by vehicular traffic based on the foregoing the city commission finds that the activity of begging panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road observe all traffic signals or warnings and move citys streets and intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a substantial risk to the public and impedes the free flow of traffic on the streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the publics free flow of travel on the citys streets the city commission further finds that the safety of beggars panhandlers solicitors pedestrians and operators and occupants of vehicles is at significant risk when such activities occur because the nature of these activities often entails beggars panhandlers or solicitors standing on traffic medians bicycle paths and public streets in use by vehicular traffic property only meant for the use and control of vehicular traffic and not begging panhandling or soliciting it is not the purpose and intent of this prohibit begging panhandling or soliciting in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic safety and traffic flow concerns or when such activities will not otherwise cause any public health welfare and safety concerns for example beggars panhandlers or solicitors may conduct their activities on public sidewalks so long as they are not conducting transactions with operators or occupants of vehicles in traffic and are otherwise in compliance with this law is timely and appropriate because current city ordinances are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest moreover this restricts begging panhandling and soliciting in certain public places while preserving ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of first amendment constitutional rights the law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg panhandle or solicit funds picket protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity its goal is instead to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of begging panhandling or solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the city and to prohibit aggressive begging panhandling and solicitation and begging panhandling and solicitation in certain public places based upon significant governmental interests  11209 begging panhandling or soliciting on public property sidewalks and streets  certain designated places prohibited a purpose the city commission finds that any person who begs panhandles or solicits under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity by unwanted touching detaining impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehension in another person constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission also finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of another person or a vehicle which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry and is an aggressive panhandler the city commission further finds that any person who begs panhandles or solicits under circumstances where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission also finds that any person begging panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles while such vehicles are on the portion of a public street currently in use by vehicular traffic and any person begging panhandling or soliciting on traffic medians bicycle paths or publics streets when such property is in use by vehicular traffic poses a threat to public safety and prevents the free flow of traffic on public streets b definitions except where the content otherwise requires as used in this chapter 1 aggressively beg panhandle

development and development necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan will require improvements and additions to the multimodal transportation system the city park system law enforcement facilities and fire and rescue facilities of the city to accommodate and maintain existing level of service standards b future growth represented by capital improvement impact projects should contribute its fair share of the cost of capacityadding improvements and additions to the multimodal transportation system the city park system law enforcement facilities and fire and rescue facilities required to accommodate capital improvement demands generated by such growth as adopted in the comprehensive plan c implementation of a reasonable impact fee structure to require future capital improvement impact projects to contribute their fair share of the cost of required new capital improvement capacity is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the comprehensive plan d the projected capital improvements and additions to the capital improvement system of the city and the allocation of projected costs between those necessary to serve existing development and those required to accommodate new capital improvement impact projects as presented in the study entitled impact fee study were approved and adopted via resolution 132482 by the city commission on  and such projections are found to be in conformity with the comprehensive plan e capital improvement planning is an evolving process and the capital improvements and additions to the multimodal transportation system the city park system law enforcement facilities and fire and rescue facilities identified upon the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived constitute projections of growth patterns and improvements and additions based upon present knowledge and judgment therefore in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth it is the intent of the city commission that the identified improvements and additions to the capital improvement system be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully and are utilized effectively based upon actual and anticipated conditions at the time of their imposition f the purpose of this chapter is to require payment of citywide impact fees by new capital improvement impact projects and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the citys capital improvement system which are required to accommodate the additional demand caused by such capital improvement impact projects this chapter shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from capital improvement impact

were lawful before the passage of this but which would be prohibited regulated or restricted under the terms of this future amendments thereto this designed to provide standards and guidelines for the control and management of nonconforming uses and noncomplying buildings and structures especially in regulating changes in the use of land or in the buildings or structures including quality volume or intensity location ownership or tenancy accessory or incidental uses extension enlargement replacement or any other change in characteristic it is the intent of this permit these nonconformities and noncompliances to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival such uses are declared by this be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved it is further the intent of this nonconformities and noncompliances shall not be enlarged upon expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district  62810   61118   definitions for purposes of this terms nonconforming use and noncomplying building or structure are defined as follows 1 nonconforming use a use of a building or structure or a tract of land which does not on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto conform to any one of the current permitted uses or the district in which it is located herein such nonconforming use may be referred to as a nonconformity 2 noncomplying building or structure any building or other structure which is a lawful use permitted or nonconforming but which does not comply with all applicable provisions of this including size and dimension regulations offstreet parking requirements landscape requirements nuisance abatement standards or height requirements either on the effective date of this ordinance or as a result of any subsequent amendment herein such noncomplying building or structure may be referred to as a noncompliance   continuance of lawful non conformities andor noncompliances a continuance of nonconformance a nonconforming use lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance may be continued subject to the provisions of this continuance of noncompliance the lawful use of a noncomplying building or structure may be continued subject to provisions of this rules for interpretation nothing in this be interpreted as authorization for or approval of the continuation of any illegal use of a building structure or land that was in violation of any ordinance in effect at the time of the passage of this ordinance the casual intermittent temporary or illegal use of land building or structure shall not be a basis to establish the existence of a nonconforming use a lawful building permit issued for any building or structure prior to the enactment of this ordinance the construction of which is in conformity with approved site plans if applicable and building plans shall not be affected by this ordinance if the building or structure is built in full compliance with this it existed at the time of the issuance of the building permit however if such building or structure does not conform to the provisions of this cause such planned building structure or use to be nonconforming or noncomplying then it shall be nonconforming or noncomplying or both as the case may be by applying this ordinance to the building structure or use   noncomplying lots or building sites of record in any district in which singlefamily dwellings are permitted notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this a singlefamily dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot or building site of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these land development regulations such lot or building site must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other building sites under the same ownership this provision shall apply even though such lot or building site fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both of the lot or building site shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot or building site is located variance of area width and yard requirements shall be obtained only of the planning and zoning commission if two or more building sites or combinations of building sites and portions of building sites with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this if all or part of the building sites do not meet the requirements for building site width and area as established by this the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet building site width and area requirements established by the land development regulations nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any building site with width or area below the requirements stated in the land development regulations  21312   increase in nonconformities prohibited a nonconforming use shall not be extended expanded enlarged or increased in intensity such prohibitions shall include but shall not be limited to the following 1 extension of a nonconforming use to any other building or other structure or the extension of a nonconforming use to any land area other than the specific land area that was actually and directly occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance or on the effective date of a subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming 2 extension of a nonconforming use within a building or other structure to any portion of floor area on the same or another floor that was not actually and directly occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance or on the effective date of a subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming 3 operation of a nonconforming use in such manner as to conflict with any performance standards established for the district in which the use is located 4 the addition of signs attached to a nonconforming building or structure intended to be seen from off the premises 5 additions which increase the area of a building or structure if the building or structure is occupied in whole or in part by a nonconforming use 6 structural alterations to any building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use except as permitted by this to the powers and procedures cited in the planning and zoning commission may grant a variance which authorizes the reconstruction of a nonconforming use which is destroyed by fire or storm damage the planning and zoning commission shall manage unanticipated future redevelopment activities necessitated by fire or other natural disasters with careful consideration of growth management and the local economy and shall consider the recommendations of the administrative official therefore if in the future structures within the city receive storm damage or fire damage in excess of 50 percent of their appraised value all such damaged structures shall be required to meet all current laws and ordinances including those enacted since construction of the subject structure however in evaluating petitions for a variance to this standard the planning and zoning commission shall balance the need to protect life and property with the equally compelling need to preserve and sustain the economic base of the community any such replacement restoration or reconstruction which may subsequently be authorized by the planning and zoning commission may only occur in compliance with those building plumbing electrical gas fire and other construction and safety related regulations of the city of casselberry in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement restoration or reconstruction the planning and zoning commission shall ensure that reasonable effort is undertaken to remedy any prior nonconformity however in no event shall the destroyed nonconforming structure be replaced to a degree or level which increases the prior existing nonconformance prior to granting any city permits for reconstruction the applicant shall provide any and all applicable state or federal permits authorizing such reconstruction nothing contained in this in any way prohibit a nonconforming use from acquiring additional offstreet parking area subject to applicable landscape requirements  21312   effect of actual construction to avoid undue hardship nothing in this be deemed to require a change in plans construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the land development regulations and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved   repairs and maintenance to structure accommodating a nonconforming use on any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls fixtures wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement value of the building provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this not be increased nothing in the land development regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such official   alterations to noncomplying structures where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this it could not be built or used under the terms of this reason of restrictions on area lot coverage height yards location on the lot or other site development standards or requirements concerning the structure it may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions 1 alteration extension enlargement or expansion of noncomplying building or structure no such alteration extension enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use or noncomplying building or structure shall be permitted in a way which increases its noncompliance with present site development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located but any such structure or use or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its noncompliance with present site development standards of the zoning district in which it is located nothing in this prohibit the city from ordering compliance with all other provisions of this applicable building construction and safety related codes 2 replacement restoration and reconstruction of noncomplying building or structure in the event that any lawful existing noncomplying structure as provided for in this is destroyed by any means such structure or use may be authorized upon receiving a variance from the planning and zoning commission in such case the planning and zoning commission shall require that any replacement restoration and reconstruction occur only in compliance with those building plumbing electrical gas fire and other construction and safety related regulations of the city of casselberry in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement restoration or reconstruction the planning and zoning commission shall require remedy of any prior noncompliance where the planning and zoning commission finds the same to be reasonable however in no event shall the destroyed noncomplying structure be replaced to a degree or level which increases the prior existing noncompliance prior to granting any city permit for reconstruction the applicant shall provide any and all applicable state and federal permits authorizing such reconstruction 3 repairs and maintenance of noncomplying building or structure routine repairs and maintenance of noncomplying structures or uses on fixtures wiring or plumbing or on the repair or replacement of walls shall be permitted 4 change in location of noncomplying building or structure should any noncomplying structure be moved for any reason to any distance whatever from its original permitted location it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved 5 treatment of offstreet parking and landscape requirements all changes in nonconformities or noncompliances shall satisfy the appropriate parking and landscape provisions cited below any required offstreet parking andor landscape improvements shall be managed offstreet parking and landscape regulations of this if only parking is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require any additional parking space which would increase the thenexisting parking deficiency the change is permitted provided the thenexisting parking deficiency and its attendant landscaping are corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the deficient offstreet parking or to the extent land is available onsite at the time of the proposed change of use whichever land area is greater b if only landscaping is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require additional parking space the change is permitted providing the then existing landscaping deficiency is corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the thendeficient landscaping or to the extent land is available onsite at the time of the proposed change of use whichever land area is greater c if the parking area is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the proposed change requires any additional parking space over the thenexisting parking deficiency the change is prohibited unless the net additional parking area and its attendant landscaping are provided and any prior existing deficiencies are corrected under the same criteria of 5a above d if both parking and landscaping are deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require any additional parking or any additional landscaping which would increase the need for parking or landscaping over the thenexisting deficiencies the change is permitted provided the deficiencies are corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the thendeficient parking or landscaping or to the extent land is available on the site at the time of the proposed change whichever land area is greater if sufficient land was not available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to allow correction of all of the parking and landscaping deficiencies and sufficient land is not then at the time of the proposed change available priority for correcting the landscaping and parking deficiencies shall be determined on a casebycase basis by the administrative official and the city engineer if the change is a minor change in site plan or by the planning and zoning commission if the change requires full site plan review e if parking and landscaping are in compliance at the time of the proposed change and the proposed change does not render either the parking or landscaping deficient the change is permitted if the proposed change would render either the parking or landscaping or both to become deficient and therefore noncomplying the change is prohibited unless the required additional parking and landscaping are provided  21312   abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming use if a nonconforming use is removed or abandoned or ceases for a continuous period of more than 90 consecutive days any and every future use of the premises shall be in conformity with the use provisions of the land development regulations all material and equipment associated with the abandoned or discontinued nonconforming use shall be completely removed from the premises by its owner within six months after the expiration of the 90day period no additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of this be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land

construction projects included in the citys capital improvements program required to meet any adopted level of service standard   criteria for concurrency and final development orders a final development order shall not be granted for a proposed development unless the city finds that adequate capacity for concurrency facilities exists at or above adopted level of service in order to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development or that improvements necessary to bring concurrency facilities up to their adopted level of service will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development the city shall find that the following criteria have been met in order for a proposed development to be found in compliance with concurrency management requirements 1 the necessary concurrency facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued or a development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place by a specified date when the impacts of the development are anticipated to occur  or 2 the necessary facilities are under construction at the time a development permit is issued  or 3 the

the necessary facilities and services have been included in the capital improvements program and are programmed for construction prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development  or 5 in the case of road facilities the necessary improvements are committed in the first three years of the applicable adopted florida department of transportation fiveyear work program or the seminole county fiveyear transportation plan  or 6 the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to fs   or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to fs ch 380 or any other development agreement entered into between the city and a development the agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the development   concurrency administration the city administrative official shall be responsible for concurrency reviews as required by this city administrative official shall determine whether adequate capacities for concurrency facilities are available to satisfy the demands of each proposed development refer to table 396 concurrency management flowchart for a graphic summary of the administration process a application for concurrency review concurrency review shall be initiated upon submission and acceptance of an application for concurrency review an applicant may request a concurrency review upon making application in an acceptable form to the city administrative official at the request of the applicant and pursuant to payment of a fee established in the manner set forth in this ordinance the city administrative official may render concurrency findings b project impact assessment the city administrative official shall use the best available information to establish and evaluate existing capacities for concurrency facilities the applicant shall be responsible for supplying the anticipated land uses densities andor intensities of a proposed development and the anticipated date of completion of proposed development the city administrative official shall assess the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on concurrency facilities c project phasingtiming of improvements concurrency facilities associated with a phased development may also be phased however all concurrency facilities necessary to accommodate the impacts of each phase must be available or a schedule for the acquired improvements must be approved prior to the issuance of a final development order the schedule of facility improvements shall ensure that all facility improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of the development or portion thereof for which a certificate of completion or certificate of occupancy has been applied shall be in place prior to the issuance of the certificate under no circumstances shall the final certificate of occupancy or completion be issued for a project unless all required facility improvements required by the development order or development agreement have been completed d development agreements if the minimum requirements for concurrency cannot be met concurrency may be achieved by guaranteeing necessary facility improvements in an enforceable development agreement said development agreement may include guarantees to construct required facility improvements or to provide funds equivalent to the cost of providing such facility improvements e concurrency review determination upon the conclusion of the concurrency review the city administrative official shall prepare a written determination concerning the proposed development this determination shall address but is not limited to 1 the anticipated public facility impacts of the proposed development  2 the ability of existing facilities to accommodate the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards  3 any existing facility deficiencies that will need to be corrected prior to the completion of the proposed development  4 the facility improvements or additions necessary to accommodate the impact of the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards and the entities responsible for the design and installation of all required facility improvements or additions  and 5 the date such facility improvements or additions will need to be completed to be concurrent with the impacts on such facilities created by the proposed development f action required to bind concurrency review after receiving an approved concurrency review the applicant may pay a binder fee within ten calendar days of the date of the determination in order to bind the available capacity required to service the proposed development the amount and method of the fee payment shall be determined by resolution of the city commission payment of the binder fee shall enable the applicant to reserve available capacity required to service the proposed development for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days within the 60calendarday period the applicant shall be required to reserve the capacity by paying a concurrency reservation fee as described below in  the binder fee shall be credited to the capacity reservation fee however if no capacity is reserved within the 60calendarday period the binder fee shall not be refunded g concurrency denials in the event that the citys concurrency review reveals that the proposed development would generate public facility impacts beyond that which can be absorbed by available capacity the city shall determine whether there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to ensure that public facilities necessary to correct the anticipated deficiency will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development if the city andor a developer are unable to provide such assurances the project shall be denied h concurrency resolution if the city administrative official determines that an application for concurrency review cannot be supported by sufficient concurrency facility capacity the applicant may file an application for concurrency resolution and pay the requisite filing fee as shall be established by resolution of the city commission the purpose for the concurrency resolution process shall be to enable an applicant to negotiate a development agreement which identifies terms for resolving the capacity deficiency the development agreement shall be consistent with fs   and applicable city ordinances if the applicant successfully resolves capacity deficiencies the applicant may reserve capacity pursuant to the terms of the development agreement if the issues cannot be resolved the application shall be deemed to be denied and at any time the applicant may resubmit the concurrency review application to the city administrative official   capacity reservation a reservation of capacity at any time during the 60day interval following receipt of an approved concurrency determination the applicant may pay a concurrency reservation fee in order to reserve concurrency facility capacity the amount of the fee and the timeframe of the concurrency reservation shall be based on a fee schedule established by resolution of the city commission the timeframe of the concurrency reservation shall not exceed two years with a twoyear renewal the amount of the fee shall vary with the timeframe of the concurrency reservation if the applicant fails to pay the fee required to reserve capacity the available capacity assigned to the applicant shall be returned to the available capacity pool and the applicant will not be eligible to file for concurrency determination until 60 calendar days following the expiration of the binder fee upon payment of a capacity reservation fee the applicant shall receive a letter of capacity reservation from the city administrative official the letter of capacity reservation does not represent overall development approval and shall not release a recipient from complying with all applicable land development regulations no final

applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that impact a road segment in the citys concurrency management system cms and have been notified of a failure to achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment or segments the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate share under fs  12 developments meeting the de minimis standards under fs  6 or to developments exempted from concurrency as previously provided in as amended from time to time of this chapter c general requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations b the citys five year capital improvement program cip includes a transportation improvements that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development as determined by the city staff 2 the public works director may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development as projected by city staff using the best available data and methodologies but is not contained in the capital improvement program where one of the following apply a the city adopts by resolution or ordinance a commitment to add the improvement to the five year capital improvement program no later than the next regular update to qualify for consideration under this the proposed improvement must be reviewed by city staff and must be found to be financially feasible this means that additional developer contributions or other funding sources are anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate the specified impacts on the identified transportation facility or facilities b if in the opinion of the public works director the funds in the adopted city five year capital improvement program are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system then a proportionate fairshare payment may be required for another improvement which will in the opinion of the public works director significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the capital improvement program of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update 3 any improvement project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet generally accepted design standards for the state of florida and the city of casselberry d application process 1 city staff shall notify an applicant in writing of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements upon receipt of such notice applicants may submit a proposed proportionate fairshare calculation to the public works director or

portion of the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be assigned a value by appropriate city staff or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference f impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees if the proposed improvement is on the list of approved projects in the most recent city impact fee technical report credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fairshare contribution is calculated the portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the arterial roadways and collector roadways in the appropriate impact fee district impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicants proportionate share obligation is calculated 2 any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fairshare contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the city g appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city capital improvements program 2 in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the capital improvement program then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of c2b of this 3 where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation calculated under 2 then the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using impact fee credits these credits will not be transferable as discussed in f2 of this excess contributions exceed impact fee credits the city may reimburse such funds as cash or methods acceptable to the applicant and the public works director  102306   public school facility concurrency a the following terms are used in discussing level of service standards for public schools proportionate share mitigation a developer improvement or contribution identified in a binding and enforceable agreement between the developer the school board and the local government with jurisdiction over the approval of the development approval to provide compensation for the additional demand on educational facilities created residential development of the property as set forth in fs  13e permanent florida inventory of school houses fish meaning the permanent facilities within the inventory of land buildings and rooms in public educational facilities used by the florida department of education office of educational facilities  and concurrency service area csa a geographic unit promulgated by the school board and adopted by local governments within which the level of service is measured when an application for residential development is reviewed for school concurrency purposes the csa coincides with groupings of school attendance zones within each school type based on adjacency level of service los standard a standard established to measure utilization of capacity within a concurrency service area csa current los within a csa is determined by dividing the fulltime equivalent student count fte for the fall semester at the same type of schools by the permanent fish capacity of the same type of schools projected or future los is determined by dividing the projected enrolled students at the same type of schools within a csa by the planned permanent fish capacity of the same type of schools b use of concurrency service area csa boundaries the city shall apply school concurrency using csa boundaries adopted by the school board the csas are described geographically in maps 13 of the support documents of the comprehensive plan and may be updated from

consistent with the methodology below j proportionate share mitigation in the event there is not available school capacity to support a development the school board may entertain proportionate share mitigation options and if accepted shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the developer to mitigate the impact from the development creation of additional school capacity 1 when the anticipated student impacts from a proposed development cause the adopted los to be exceeded the developers proportionate share will be based on the number of additional student stations necessary to achieve the established los the amount to be paid will be calculated by the cost per student station for elementary middle and high school as determined and published by the state of florida 2 the methodology used to calculate a developers proportionate share mitigation shall be as follows proportionate share    1 development students  available capacity  2 total cost per student station where 1 development students   those students from the development that are assigned to a csa and have triggered a deficiency of the available capacity 2 total cost   the cost per student station as determined and published by the state of florida 3 the applicant shall be allowed to enter a 90day negotiation period with the school board in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development

developer shall receive an impact fee credit for the proportionate share mitigation credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution was calculated the portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the school type elementary middle high in the appropriate csa impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicants proportionate share obligation is calculated any school impact fee credit based on proportionate fair share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the csa 6 a proportionate share mitigation contribution shall not be subsequently amended or refunded after final site plan or plat approval to reflect a reduction in planned or constructed residential density 7 impact fees shall be credited

development districts ie see planned residential district prd and planned mixeduse pmx districts are established to implement provisions of the comprehensive plan directed toward conserving open space and natural resources promoting more effective use of developable uplands with available urban services and promoting mixeduse development of strategically located large parcels having urban services and direct access to major arterial streets the planned unit development districts provide a voluntary management framework for coordinating objectives of the development of the community which may be inconsistent with conventional zoning district provisions the planned unit development districts incorporate a more flexible management structure for negotiating private sector development objectives which reinforce and further public sector goals objectives and policies for the citys development and resource conservation the planned unit development districts are intended to 1 encourage innovative planning to achieve urban infill commercial revitalization and natural resource preservation the planned unit development concept is intended to present developers incentives for accomplishing these objectives by providing significantly more flexibility in the design of future development the planned unit development option frees developers from most of more rigid size and
