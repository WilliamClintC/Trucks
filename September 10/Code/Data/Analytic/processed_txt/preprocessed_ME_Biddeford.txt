article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning affiliate  a person with whom an applicant under this article has a direct financial business or management interest capacity  not only the ability of the treatment plant to physically receive a particular amount of flow per day but the ability of the treatment plant to properly and effectively treat the flow within all limits established by any federal or state license commencement of construction  the placement of the foundation whether a frost wall floating slab or complete cellar the walls andor the floor of which must be considered complete by the building inspector entry of wastewater permit required  permit limitations  no person may undertake any development activity which will create new wastewater flow into the city sewer system or which will increase existing flow from any property without first obtaining a sewer use permit from the city engineer under this article sewer use permits shall not be required for the replacement or addition of plumbing fixtures within existing residential units a neither the building inspector nor the plumbing inspector may issue any building permit occupancy permit or any other type of permit to anyone who prior to  had received a sewer use permit under this article or for any project appearing in the appendix to the ordinance from which this chapter was derived which is on file in the city clerks office unless the applicant presents a certificate from the city engineer that the applicant has complied within the provisions of this chapter b regardless of allotted capacity as determined for any period and as shown in the documents on file in the city clerks office for any period no sewer use permit may be issued during periods when no capacity remains as determined by the city engineer the prohibition set forth in this subsection applies notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter c charter comparative table chct751 findings statement of emergency and purpose  the design capacity of the wastewater treatment plant 3300000 million gallons per day is met or exceeded during spring runoffs when groundwater infiltration inflow cellar sumps and yard drains are tied into the sewer system rainfall also leads to exceeded capacity by entering sewer systems and roof drains these flow conditions overburden hydraulic equipment at the treatment plant causing overflow situations current average hydraulic loading to the treatment plant is between 3000000 million and 3100000 million gallons per day current design is 3300000 million gallons a day estimated time for completion of upgrade of the wastewater facility is four years the city has estimated an allocation of 240000 gallons over the fouryear period this estimate is subject to change this article provides for periodic review by the city engineer of the actual capacity remaining to be allocated a during periods when no remaining capacity exists new flow into the system will be prohibited until capacity is restored or created or removal of infiltration and inflow or other methods educational efforts will be required by both the public and private sectors to encourage conservation to help create available capacity while the city is taking steps to cure these problems and to increase the systems capacity these steps cannot all be accomplished immediately accordingly it is the intent of this article that new or additional sewage be discharged into the system in moderate amounts to permit some growth and to ensure that any excess capacity which develops is portioned out fairly and over a period of time until the city has taken all steps necessary to cure the systems problems and significantly increase its capacity b an additional element of this article is the implementation of voluntary and mandatory conservation measures designed to effectively increase available capacity c because existing plant capacity could be greatly exceeded if immediate efforts are not undertaken to control and manage new wastewater flow and because this article is a vital part of the citys efforts to plan for orderly growth the city council determines that the facts justifying this article constitute an emergency within the meaning of of the charter d it is the intent of the city to establish in the long run a program under which anyone seeking to enter new flow into the system will be required to remove a defined percentage of the amount of the proposed new flow elimination of infiltration and inflow once the inflow and infiltration removal program is in place the allocation system may be eliminated e biddeford code chct752 capacity of plant  expiration of article  program monitoring

buffer design criteria references to table 61 for buffer removal efficiencies see this table in the most recent version of the mdep best management practices 1 maximum contributing drainage area the length of the vegetated buffer should be at least as long as the runoff flow path across the contributing drainage area the depth or buffer width referred to in table 61 of the buffer strip should not be more than 250 feet in length without an intervening level spreader 2 maximum slope must be less than 30% to be included in the calculation of buffer width areas with slopes greater than 30% are too steep to be effective as a treatment buffer but should be left undisturbed the optimum slope for effective treatment is around 1% 3 distribution of runoff over the buffer to be treated runoff must enter the buffer as sheet flow and cannot be allowed to channelize buffers will not treat shallow concentrated or channelized flow runoff should be distributed across the buffer strip so that the maximum flow velocities are well below one fps the maximum allowable q10 velocity should be less than three fps galli 1993 e biddeford code chct1044 4 restabilization of buffers used for sediment control during construction if a buffer has been used to trap sediment during construction sediments shall be removed and buffer will be regraded and the top of the buffer will be reseeded 5 pretreatment for buffers with bare soil contributing areas to prevent a heavy sediment loading from damaging the buffer sites that will have areas of bare soil for a long time can not utilize this bmp without first pretreating the runoff with a sediment control bmp 6 buffer width length the recommended minimum buffer width is 25 feet maine dep 1992 only continuous width may be counted when calculating buffer width maximum buffer width length is 250 feet 7 provision of ditch turnouts turnouts should receive no more than one cfs of peak flow during a storm event if the peak flow is greater than one cfs the spacing between turnouts should be reduced so that the peak flow from each turnouts drainage area is less than 10 cfs the following formula can be used to find the peak flow from a drainage area to a ditch turnout maine dep 1992 peak flow   impervious area in ft2 + pervious area in ft2 the turnout should extend into the side ditch or cut slope in a manner that it intercepts the ditch runoff and carries it into the buffer area the buffer end of the turnout must be level or equipped with a level spreader such as a shallow stone trench to promote sheet flow refer to erosion and sediment control for construction mdep 1991 for level spreader designs use table 61 to determine the treatment factor of the buffer by measuring the length the road runoff travels buffer continuously or in cases where the runoff parallels the road until the runoff encounters the next ditch turnout 8 buffer vegetation for buffer strip design and practice in maine the following vegetation designations are suggested to be utilized a wooded example of a wooded buffer is shown in figure 63 b nonwooded fields or reverting fields as well as forested areas where more than 40% of the timber has been harvested in the past 10 years or where ground cover or leaf litter has been disturbed when mowed the height should be cropped to not less that six inches c seeded mowed lawns or seeded or sodded areas previously disturbed by construction activity an example of a seeded buffer is shown in figure 63 charter comparative table chct1045 refer to the maine erosion and sediment control handbook maine dep 1991 for appropriate seed mixtures and application methods for seeded buffers figure 63 schematic of a seeded and wooded buffer strip maintenance of the buffer the planning board will require the applicant to submit a maintenance agreement and a maintenance schedule for the buffer these items need to be approved of by the board as part of the project maintenance requirements for buffers can be reduced by managing them as undisturbed natural areas wooded buffers should be maintained as specified in phosphorus control in lake watersheds maine dep 1992 pp 6062 1

vegetative swale design criteria 1 soils underlying soils should have a high infiltration rate at least 10 incheshour 2 channel design the channel should be designed for low velocity flow a velocity of one fps is the maximum design storm flow velocity recommended when vegetated swales are being designed as a bmp higher velocities might be permissible for channel stability but could result in resuspension of settled particulates the maximum allowable q10 velocity should be less than three fps flow depths in the swales should be minimized to increase the amount of vegetative filtering and settling a maximum design flow depth of one foot is suggested the minimum width of the flat bottom of a trapezoidal channel shall be at least three times the channel depth nontrapezoidal channels should have similar depth to width relationships the grade of the channel should be as flat as possible and preferably less than 2% mpca 1989 channels should be designed for capacity and stability in

reseedingsodding of bare spots removal of trash leaves andor accumulated sediments and the control of woody or other undesirable vegetation swales must be maintained to remove fine sediment if their infiltrative capacity is to be maintained in addition the buffer strip may require periodic mechanical aeration to restore infiltration capacity this aeration must be done during a time when the area can be reseeded and mulched prior to any significant rainfall it is important to install erosion and sediment control measures to stabilize this area as soon as possible and to retain any organic matter in the bottom of the trench routine fertilization andor use of pesticides is strongly discouraged a minimum mow height of six inches is generally recommended galli 1993 vehicular traffic should be excluded from the waterway the area should be inspected for failures following heavy rainfall and repaired as necessary if complete reseeding is necessary half the original recommended rate of

designed rock riprap or protective channel lining the check dam may have a solid level surface integrated into it for added durability as shown in figure 64 check dam heights are generally six to 12 inches depending on channel slope and desired storage capacity the check dams should be notched or ported to allow the flows in excess of their infiltrative capacity to be bypassed check dams should be designed so that the water ponded behind them will infiltrate in 12 hours or less galli 1993 charter comparative table chct1049 office buildings office residential zones  maintenance of the buffer

stormwater management to the decision of the office such appeal shall be submitted in accordance with of this ordinance in reviewing administrative appeals under this section the zoning board of appeals shall consider the following as the guiding criteria for the citys attempt to regulate signs 1 the purpose of this ordinance as outlined in above the city is attempting to avoid a neon jungle along the major roadways of the city 2 the city is attempting to maintain the rural and residential character of the several zoning districts where residential use is the primary land use while trying to ensure that permitted commercialindustrial activities are able to identify their locations 3 in light of the above criteria the city has adopted the standards set forth herein 4 all materials stored outdoors shall be stored in such a manner as to prevent the breeding and harboring of insects rats or other vermin this shall be accomplished by enclosures in containers raising materials above ground separation of material prevention of stagnant water extermination procedures or other means a all new construction and development whether or not served by a stormwater collection and transportation system shall be designed to reflect or resemble as nearly as possible natural runoff conditions in terms of volume velocity and location of runoff 1 if runoff after development would exceed predevelopment runoff conditions the offsite impact must be evaluated in terms of potential soil erosion and sedimentation drainage capacity and the land useland cover characteristics appropriate methods of reducing offsite impact shall be employed 2 stormwater management evaluations and designs shall be based on a twentyfourhour twentyfiveyear occurrence interval storm 3 the planning board may when it deems it appropriate require calculations that are based on a fiftyyear storm 4 a all development plans shall define maintenance requirements and identify parties responsible for maintenance of the stormwater control system whenever practical underground stormwater management systems shall be employed when methods of reducing stormwater impact are necessary or desirable stormwater runoff control plans shall include b charter comparative table chct1077 1 control methods effective both during and after construction control methods compatible with upstream and downstream characteristics 2 documentation by the designer that increasing the volume and rate of runoff from the proposed development will not aggravate conditions downstream or upstream 3 provisions for onsite storage and gradual discharge of excessive flows or contribution toward increasing downstream capacity eg by enlarging existing culverts when the channel downstream is not able to accommodate the increased volume or rate of runoff created by the proposed development 4 consideration of the following factors a impact onsite downstream upstream and basinwide costs initial amortized operation and maintenance cost paid by person if not onsite b c intensity of rainfall timing of rainfall eg falling of snow or during the spring snowmelt d amount of precipitation in the basin during the five days preceding the storm in question e hydrologic soil groups throughout the basin ie the soils rate of water infiltration and transmission f hydrologic conditions throughout the basin soils moisture content humusorganic content temperature and whether or not it is frozen g vegetative cover throughout the basin vegetation helps soil dry out after a rainfall intercepts some precipitation during the rainfall and slows down the flow of water over the land h area of land covered by impervious surfaces throughout the basin roads sidewalks roofs driveways patios etc i topography throughout the basin slopes affect the rate of runoff marshland reduces peak discharge rate by slowing down the rate of runoff j size and shape of watershed peak discharge rates are slower in long narrow watersheds k 5 stormwater runoff systems should be designed to facilitate aquifer recharge when it is advantageous to compensate for groundwater c biddeford code chct1078 studies and impactdevelopment fees withdrawals or reductions in infiltration conversely designs should avoid recharge where groundwater effects might be harmful design of permanent storage facilities should consider safety appearance recreational use and cost and effectiveness of maintenance operations in addition to the primary storage function natural overland flows and open drainage channel and swale locations should be the preferred alignments for major components of a residential drainage system the use of enclosed components such as underground piping should be minimized where the existing natural systems are able to accommodate storm runoff energy dissipators to reduce high flow velocities and other forms of outfall protection shall be employed where enclosed drains discharge onto erodible soils103 the city of biddeford recognized that a community must have development of new residential commercial and industrial facilities in order to maintain an adequate supply of quality

conferred hereby g purpose the purpose of planned unit development regulations is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design of land developments in the growth areas of biddeford planned unit developments are intended to allow substantial flexibility in planning and designing a proposal this flexibility often accrues in the form of relief from compliance with conventional zoning ordinance site and design requirements ideally this flexibility results in a development that is better planned that contains more amenities and ultimately a development that is more desirable to live in than one produced in accordance with typical zoning ordinance and subdivision controls a charter comparative table chct1097 an intrinsic premise upon which the approval of a planned unit development pud must be conditioned is that while more lenient siting requirements may be granted the planned unit developments are encouraged to contain features not normally required of traditional developments objectives through proper planning and design each planned unit development should be designed with the following objectives in mind to allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible application of standard zoning and subdivision controls 1 to encourage land development that to the greatest extent possible preserves natural vegetation respects natural topographic and geologic conditions and refrains from adversely affective flooding soil drainage and other natural ecologic conditions 2 to combine and coordinate architectural styles building forms and structuralvisual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of different land uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner 3 to provide for abundant accessible and properly located public open and recreation space common open and recreation space and other public and commonly held facilities 4 to promote the efficient use of land resulting in networks of utilities streets and other infrastructure features that maximize the allocation of fiscal and natural resources 5 to enable
