129801 128801 intent given area other than by conventional zoning district controls this alternative approach to land development is designed to give greater development flexibility thereby encouraging higher dedication to quality of land use and site design it is further the intent of this development approach that the alternative land use development patterns permitted in the pd district will be designed and laid out with particular attention to creating a desirable human experience by establishing harmonious relationships between land use types relative to uses of land the location of uses on the land and the architectural and functional compatibility between them ba planned development project is viewed as an integrated development concept to that end the provisions of this chapter are not intended to be used as a device for avoiding the zoning requirements that would otherwise apply but rather to encourage the use redevelopment and improvement of existing sites
