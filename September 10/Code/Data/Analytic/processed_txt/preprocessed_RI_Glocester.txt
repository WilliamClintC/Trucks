section any person who continues to violate any provision of this section after receiving notice of such violation shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter and subject to a fine of $500 per day for each violation each day such a violation is continued is a separate offense a intent 1 the town council finds pursuant to the authority contained in rigl  452329 as amended that it is necessary to provide for innovative land development practices with respect to the siting and installation of telecommunications towers antennas and accessory structures  and 2 the town council further finds that the preparation enactment and implementation of a zoning ordinance relating to telecommunications towers antennas and accessory structures is necessary to address the protection of public health safety and welfare of the citizens of glocester  and 3 therefore it is the intent of the town council that this section provide guidance and direction with respect to matters affecting the siting and installation of telecommunications towers antennas and accessory structures  35055 yard sales  35056  b purpose 1 general purposes the general purpose of this section is to regulate the placement of wireless communications towers antennas and related facilities and the addition of wireless communications equipment to existing structures the regulations serve to establish a procedure for application permits and for special use permits  to establish development standards and location requirements  and to encourage the colocation of equipment onto existing structures 2 the specific purposes of this section are to a address public safety concerns associated with the siting of wireless communications facilities  including towers antennas and related facilities equipment and structures b preserve the character appearance property values natural resources and historic sites of the town  c minimize the number of new tower facilities by encouraging and requiring colocation wherever possible  d limit the height of telecommunications tower facilities  and encourage maximum setbacks from roads property boundaries and existing structures  e encourage the siting of new wireless communications facilities on properties owned by the town or its instrumentalities  f encourage location of towers and antennas in industrial zoned and other areas where visual and other impacts on the community are minimized  g discourage location of towers and antennas in areas zoned and used for residential purposes to the extent that they significantly diminish the character or value of real property in the residential area h provide for the design and siting of wireless communications facilities so as to minimize their visual impact on neighboring properties and on the character of the town i discourage the construction of towers that would require airspace obstruction marking andor lighting j encourage small facility options that will reduce unnecessary tower structures but will integrate well into the context and character of the community 3 in addition to the aforementioned this chapter also intends to minimize the number of tower structures by encouraging large towers at strategically spaced intervals that provide optimal coverage for the maximum number of service providers with the  35056 glocester code  35056  least impact on the community this section limits the quantity of large towers by requiring a twomile separation between towers and by requiring performance criteria that minimize the impact on the community c applicability 1 new towers and facilities the requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location of all new telecommunications facilities and related equipment including television and radio transmission towers except as provided herein the general height limitations of this chapter otherwise applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas 2 amateur radio antennas this section shall not govern any tower or the installation of any antenna that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receiveonly antennas 3 preexisting towers and antennas any tower or antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section however any proposed extension beyond 20 feet in the height of an existing facility replacement of a facility or installation of an additional antenna to a facility other than a facility on land owned or leased by the town and serving town communications needs shall be subject to the requirements of this section d general conditions this section makes a distinction between new or existing tower structures and placement of antenna array on existing structures in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of towers on the community 1 principal or accessory use antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses or structures as appropriate a different existing use or existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot for purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district dimensional regulations including but not limited to setback requirements lot coverage requirements and other such requirements the dimensions of the entire lot shall control even though the antenna or tower may be located on leased parcels within such lots towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a legal existing nonconforming use or structure towers and associated equipment that may be located within or outside of base facilities may not take away required parking spaces of an existing building or use  35056 yard sales  35056  2 building codessafety standards to ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is constructed and maintained in compliance with or exceeds the standards contained in the applicable state building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the electronics industries association as amended from time to time and shall structurally accommodate reasonable colocation the owner of the tower shall also ensure that the tower and related facilities comply with other applicable safety and environmental standards including but not limited to safety limits for human exposure to radio frequency energy if upon inspection the building official concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards andor that it constitutes a danger to persons or property then the building official shall notify the owner of the tower in writing and the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance failure of the owner to do so shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owners expense in addition to other legal remedies available to the town the building official may proceed in accordance with of title 23 of the rhode island general laws entitled state building codes 3 general requirements all wireless communications facilities shall be erected installed maintained and used in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws rules and regulations including radio frequency emission standards 4 colocation all owners and operators of land used in whole or in part for a wireless communications facility and all owners and operators of such facilities shall as a continuing condition of installing constructing erecting and using a wireless communications tower facility and subject to necessary approvals hereunder permit other public utilities or fcclicensed commercial entities seeking to operate a wireless communications tower facility to install erect mount and use compatible equipment and fixtures on the mounting structure on reasonable commercial terms this is provided that such colocation does not materially interfere with the transmission andor reception of communications signals to or from the existing facility and provided that there are no structural or other physical limitations that make it impractical to accommodate the proposed additional wireless communications equipment or fixtures erection of a replacement facility to address such concerns shall be considered where the zoning board determines appropriate wireless communications facilities shall be designed to accommodate colocation to the extent technologically and physically practical given the limitations of the site and area 5 number of towers only one wireless communications tower structure per site shall be authorized by this chapter unless the  35056 glocester code  35056  placement of more than one tower structure on the site results in a substantially better design that is integrated into the neighboring uses and meets community standards an example of this may be the erection of two flagpole structures located in a recreational facility the erection of more than one lattice tower or monopole in a residential area would not be an example of a better design 6 removal of facilities all unused telecommunications facilities and structures including nonconforming or preexisting facilities which have not been used for one year shall be considered abandoned and shall be dismantled and removed at the owners expense the owner of such facility shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the building official before a permit is issued and as a condition thereof said owner shall post and thereafter continuously maintain an appropriate surety bond approved in amount and form by the town solicitor and the public works director every two years to cover the cost of removal of all facilities and restoration of the site if such antenna or tower is not removed within 90 days the town may take the necessary action to remove the facility at the owners expense the owners of the property and the facility shall be jointly and individually responsible for removal of said facilities restoration of the site and for all associated costs expended or incurred in the course of removal and restoration 7 carrier utilization included in an application for a telecommunications tower or antenna an applicant must demonstrate that it has a commitment from one or more licensed wireless services providers to occupy the facility for the purposes of transmitting andor receiving wireless communications wireless communications towers shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of colocators reasonably

of glocester has many residents who own large tracts of land in excess of the minimum zoning requirement and wish to subdivide that land for use as singlefamily residences under the conventional zoning requirements this would be allowed only if the land has sufficient acreage and frontage along a suitably improved town or state road b in addition there are many treelined roads that are enjoyed by residents and visitors alike when development occurs along these roads all too often the visual buffer of trees and shrubs is removed to make way for the development of roads and housing c the rural residential compound model addresses these issues it allows greater design flexibility for landowners with large tracts of land and creates more opportunities for preservation of open space than the conventional zoning regulations by allowing a reduction of frontage and access to lots along a private way it promotes development in harmony with glocesters rural character by reducing density and requiring a visual buffer between home sites and the existing town or state roads because the development occurs along a private way the town benefits from the reduced road maintenance

what to do 2 emergency information procedures  3733 glocester code  3733  a doortodoor route alerting  altering and notifying the population by going door to door is usually the first procedure initiated immediately after an incident sometimes especially in transportation emergencies this procedure may be the only means available for notifying segments of the public however doortodoor route alerting can be very time consuming a problem in rapidly developing hazardous material incidents  responders who do not have the proper protective equipment must not place themselves at risk by entering a toxic atmosphere in an attempt to alert the population b area route alerting in this method motor vehicles equipped with public address systems travel routes identified by the incident

town or adjacent communities may be affected  in most cases it would not be necessary to activate the statewide ebs to notify the entire state of a hazardous material emergency however the statewide ebs may be utilized to inform listeners to tune to a particular radio station for further information community officials are encouraged to and may develop an agreement with a local radio station to broadcast local emergency information  activation of the ebs a the incident commander shall request that the civil defense director or his alternate communicate with the ri emergency management agency

situation see attachment 2 to this annex90 d protective actions 1 general to implement actions that would reduce or eliminate public and emergency worker exposure to hazardous materials release into the environment a release of a hazardous material into the environment could quickly bring harm to public health and can immediately pose lifethreatening dangers to emergency workers inplace sheltering and evacuation are protective actions that the public could take to reduce or eliminate its exposure to a hazardous material 2 implementing public protective action the incident commander shall be responsible for ordering initial protective actions in a largescale protective action representatives of the town council shall be notified to be effective protective actions must be started as soon as the hazard is recognized by the incident commander windborne chemical plumes travel the speed of the wind for example if a light breeze of five miles per hour is blowing the plume will travel approximately five miles in one hour or one mile in 12 minutes a inplace sheltering evacuation during incidents involving chemicals is sometimes but by no means always necessary airborne toxicants can be released and move downwind so rapidly that there would be no time to evacuate residents for shortterm releases often the most prudent course of action for the protection of the nearby residents would be to remain inside with the doors and windows and the heating and air conditioning systems shut off an airborne release will frequently move past quickly additionally vulnerable populations such as the sick and elderly may sustain more injury during evacuation than they would by staying inside and putting simple countermeasures into effect b evacuation accidental releases of hazardous materials may require the evacuation of the population these areas can include those directly affected by toxic fumes and those that may be potentially affected during the course of the incident 90editors note attachment 2 is included at the end of this chapter  3733 glocester code  3733   3734 organization and responsibilities evacuation is a complex undertaking the considerations
