forth in this section of the based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate prior document ch 5 art i  601   5129 appeal board athe floodplain board of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this bthe floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this cin passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this  1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges dupon consideration of the factors and the purposes of this the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this eany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to any state sponsored flood relocation

or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided the procedures of this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon a 1showing of good and sufficient cause  2determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in vol ii  515 in the definition of

it is the citys policy that it shall be the responsibility of the developer to install improvements along their frontage to the ultimate grade and alignment for that boundary street this may include removal and replacement of the existing street surface to the centerline if that structure is inadequate to meet the current design standards concrete curb and gutter concrete sidewalk street lighting landscaping irrigation and burial of overhead utilities will be required at the sole or substantial expense of the developer bstorm drainage policy 1it is the citys policy that all developments within the city shall provide sufficient retentiondetention so as to minimize the adverse impact of that development on its downstream neighbors to that end all development shall provide sufficient onsite retentiondetention to contain at the least the runoff generated by storm event falling on that property see apache junction city ii  1042a1 and 2 such retentiondetention facilities shall be separate and distinct tracts or drainage easements within the development and shall be planned for accordingly 2further it is the citys policy that all developments shall provide adequate drainage facilities so as to convey runoff generated both on and off the project around or project in such a manner as to ensure that the structures will be free from flooding and that there is reasonable access for emergency and public service vehicles the developer shall install storm sewers channels andor other physical improvements necessary to achieve this result 3the drainage design manual for maricopa
