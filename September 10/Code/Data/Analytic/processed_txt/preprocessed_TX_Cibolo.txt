processed in accordance with this preplanning conference is required between the applicant and the planning director prior to the actual filing of the application 13 district plans and requirements there are two 2 types of plans that are used in the planned development process the general purpose and use of each plan is described as follows a master plan the master plan is intended to serve a general land arrangement plan as the first step in the planned development process when a pud district is created it establishes the most general guidelines for the district by identifying land use types thoroughfare locations if applicable and project boundaries and illustrates the integration of these elements into a master plan for the whole pud district the master plan will become an exhibit to the ordinance creating the pud district where appropriate it is acceptable for the master plan and pud be supplemented with a detailed written narrative and any other exhibits as necessary to convey to the manner in which the pud will be developed since each pud is unique the required information necessary to review each pud will vary depending on the size and nature of the development and the particular mix of proposed uses when written narratives andor exhibits are utilized the city may include such information as conditions of the pud ordinance as may be pertinent to the request the master plan shall include the following minimum information 1 a general statement setting forth how the proposed district will relate to the cibolo comprehensive master plan future land use map future

depicting existing land uses transportation networks and related contextual details of the area surrounding the proposed pud the context plan shall be reviewed with the master plan to determine if the master plan is appropriate as proposed or if development standards applicable to the proposed pud should be incorporated into the pud  the purpose of the context plan is to facilitate the review of the pud application and determine if the proposed pud will be compatible with surrounding development failure to properly relate the proposed pud master plan to the context map may be used as a basis for denying a proposed pud application b the following elements shall be shown or highlighted on the context plan for the area surrounding the pud with details demonstrating how the proposed pud will

or employmentrelated that is then supported by a mix of one or more other uses such as residential civic or institutional activity centers may vary in size intensity scale and their mix of supportive uses depending on their purpose location and context in each case activity centers are intended to be mixeduse and pedestrianoriented with good connections and transitions to surrounding areas residences are a component of all activity centers whether onsite or immediately adjacent the activity center should support a range of housing types and densities within the individual neighborhoods there are three 3 distinct types of activity centers buildto line unlike a setback line a buildto line is the line at which construction of a building faade must occur on a lot a buildto line runs parallel to and is measured from the front property line and is established to create an even or more or less even building faade line on a street commercial center commercial centers are activity centers that primarily accommodate large retail establishments which may provide major durable goods shopping and serve a number of residential areas over a significant portion of the city commercial centers contain a mix of supporting uses including multifamily dwellings office entertainment and retail uses medical offices and clinics and civic uses the mix enables combined trip destinations and supports more effective transit service and provides viable pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation the fm 78 overlay district is an example of a commercial center concept plan mixed use a

graphic and narrative document that displays the sequence andor timing of intended development phasing is used to sequence the provision of public facilities phasing may be specified in a sequential order 1 2 3 or by time period 200 2005 regionalemployment center a regionalemployment center is a large thirty 30 or more acres intensive activity center that combines the uses of commercial centers and employment centers and that serves the city and region as a whole a regional activity center may be a regional shopping mall corporate office headquarters or a major concentration of employment supported by a mix of uses that meets the needs of employees visitors and residents primary uses include major commercial andor employment uses supported by a full range and mix of uses including large and small retail establishments general offices and office complexes governmental and civic uses business services research and development major service uses restaurants lodging child care personal services and higher density housing as well as warehousing and industrial uses or educational facilities these centers are generally located at the intersection of or along major arterials or in close proximity to limited access freeways and interstates 10 and 35 the mixed use regional employment center mure district is an example of this mixed use district site and building transitions designing and adapting the form and mass of a building to take into consideration neighboring buildings and land uses transitions generally an array of tools and techniques designed to achieve compatibility between adjoining land uses that may differ by type and intensity transition uses a land use that may be appropriate to be located between land uses of different types and intensities within a mixed use project or in the context of surrounding land uses vertical mixeduse building a multistory building containing a vertical mix of two or more principal uses walkway or pedestrian walkway an onsite path for pedestrians andor bicyclists that is not part of the public rightofway and is not a public dedicated sidewalk or public dedicated trail walkways as defined herein are private sidewalks that typically combine to form a network providing internal pedestrian and bicyclist access and circulation on a development site and typically connect to the public sidewalk system wrapped use a retail service or other commercial use type that occupies the ground floor of a structure and extends on both sides of a corner of a structure 3 mixed use regional employment center mure district regulations a purpose this zoning district is reserved for areas suitable to provide a mix of very high density residential retail office service research and development institutional and clean light industrial uses along major highway corridors the purpose of this district is to promote economic development and retail activity while promoting traffic circulation and safety protecting adjacent residential neighborhoods and promoting a positive image of the community it is expressly intended that no low density residential dwellings will be allowed in this district and that any existing dwellings will remain as legal nonconforming dwellings medium density residential uses shall only be considered in the form of apartments or condominiums on upper stories of buildings where higher intensity uses are provided on the ground level this district is intended to accommodate development of regionalemployment centers the district is for large intensive activity centers that combine the uses of commercial centers and employment centers and serve the city and region as a whole the district should be utilized for significant and mutually supportive combinations of commercial and employment activities because of their size both sets of activities function as regional centers in terms of market for retail and employment opportunities higher density residential use is also a critical component of a regionalemployment center in order to assure extended hours of activity within the district and provide support for a mix of uses uses should include a mix of commercial and employment uses integrated in a single mutually supportive regional destination these uses may range from regional mall anchor stores government offices and corporate headquarters to specialty retail and higher density housing they may also include research and development uses major service and office center complexes and major educational facilities as well as warehousing and industrial uses that will not diminish the suitability of the district for less intensive uses supporting uses may include restaurants hotels entertainment childcare civic activities business services lodging for business travelers and multifamily residential uses uses should be concentrated and mixed to create more diversity and synergy among uses combine destinations support more effective transit service and provide viable pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation mobility choices should be integrated by providing pedestrian and bicycle connectivity within the center and to adjoining areas b location a mure zoning district should typically be located at the intersection of two major highways or arterial streets along the citys planned arterial system or in close proximity to limited access freeways and interstate highways concentrated employment activities should be located within mure zone districts whenever possible sites with direct access to existing or planned major transportation facilities and compatibility with adjacent land uses are appropriate for the mure zone district c incentives regulatory incentives are provided in the mure zoning

that allows development to propose alternative design concepts that will fully implement the spirit and intent of any design standard for mixed use development alternative design it is not a general waiver of regulations but is rather a sitespecific plan to incorporate an alternative design that is equal to or better than the strict application of a design standard in meeting the intent of both the particular mixed use zone district and the applicable standard if a mixed use concept plan or site plan is to include a request for approval of alternative compliance a presubmittal conference is

benefit the city or would assist the city the city may also assign mure zoning to smaller sized properties in order to achieve the goal of assembling properties for the purpose of creating a conventionally sized mure district g blocks access and street design standards the single most important element in the physical and functional integration of mixed use development is vehicular and pedestrian transportation networks and orientation the overall layout of a mixed use project is built around a viable transportation network that provides for superior movement of automobile and truck traffic and includes pedestrianfriendly improvements to generate a high level of pedestrian activity and connectivity between different land uses the framework for a pedestrianoriented layout has three main components 1 a block structure that reflects a walkable arrangement and positioning of uses 2 building placement orientation and design to enhance the pedestrian environment and streetscape within that structure and 3 a street network to define the block edges create continuous pedestrian connections and integrate pedestrian travel with other modes of transportation 1 block design the following block design guidelines are intended to provide for enhanced automobile and truck access efficiencies and create pedestrianoriented development by establishing a welldefined pattern of walkable blocks and intersecting streets attractive and welldesigned streetscapes that are humanscaled and pedestrian friendly buildings must relate appropriately to surrounding mixed uses and create a heightened sense of place by providing safe efficient and convenient vehicular access and circulation patterns in concert with pedestrianfriendly development designs a block standards i block

section may be public or private all public and private streets shall be designed and constructed according to the policies standards and guidelines governing street design of this section the udc and the cibolo design and construction manual h pedestrian and bicycle access circulation and connections 1 pedestrian friendly design is integral to efficient circulation in a mixed use development mixed use center visitors and residents should be encouraged to walk via a carefully designed safe and enjoyable network of sidewalks and walkways easy reasonably direct access should be provided to buildings amenities parking and bike paths there should be frequent well placed connections to adjacent land uses to encourage neighbors to use alternative means of transportation to visit the center pedestrian crosswalks should be designed so that pedestrians are as safe as possible development of appropriately designed crosswalks is encouraged for the safety and convenience of pedestrian streetcrossings the goal is to place at least as much emphasis on alternative modes of transportation as on auto access 2 these standards are intended to ensure a safe and convenient system of wellconnected pedestrian ways and bikeways these facilities shall be designed to link mure developments with adjacent uses including residential areas shopping employment centers recreational facilities open space parks transit stops and schools within individual developments safe and convenient pedestrian and bikeway systems shall be provided that directly connect buildings parking areas

connections shall be provided to and between the following points f the primary entrance or entrances to each building containing a principal use  g greenways or trail systems  and h onsite amenities i pedestrian networks must be provided that provide linkages to primary mixed use development destinations to prevent short cuts areas or unnecessary driving consequently sidewalks should be planned early in the site design process and should be broadly depicted on the mixed use concept plan j all developments served by onsite parking in surface lots or parking structures shall provide either a sidewalk along the perimeter of the block or a designated pedestrian walkways parking lot extending from the rows of parking furthest from the building served to either a building entrance or to a sidewalk or walkway leading to such entrance k where an internal block face exists or is proposed greater than four hundred feet 400 a pedestrian walkway shall be included parking lot separate from streets such that the four hundred foot 400 minimum distance between walkways is achieved alternative compliance may be allowed as described in this section l where an enhanced drive aisle forms the perimeter of a block sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the drive aisle i parking the purpose of this section is to ensure the provision location and design of offstreet parking areas that accommodate motor vehicles while balancing the needs of pedestrians bicyclists and transit users with the use of the automobile parking areas are secondary and supportive of the primary land uses on the site 1 generally the parking requirements of the udc shall be applicable to all mixed use districts the city however recognized that the unique nature of mixed use development poses challenges to providing adequate number of parking for mixed use projects or a wasteful surplus of parking spaces and impervious cover this is particularly an issue in mixed developments that combine residential and nonresidential uses that have unique parking needs such as hotels restaurants medical uses and high density residential consequently the city will allow the submittal of a parking demand analysis developed specifically to quantify the offstreet parking requirements for a specific land use or mix of land uses such a parking analysis shall be prepared by qualified professionals and shall be subject to city approval mixed use concept plan process without the need for variances from the parking standards of the udc 2 exemption for offstreet parking in structures required offstreet parking spaces provided within a parking structure either above or belowgrade shall be exempt from the maximum offstreet parking amount established above 3 shared parking standards the amount of offstreet

subject uses parking the parking demand study shall provide information and evidence about the anticipated parking demand at peak times during a day and the distance relationship between available shared parking spaces and the specific uses served 4 shared parking encouraged to promote an overall reduction in parking the use of shared parking shall be required when the development is under the control of a single ownerdeveloper and contains commercial retail office institutional or other uses with staggered peak parking demands 5 shared parking and cross access agreements where shared parking is provided a shared parking and cross access agreement between the cooperating property owners shall be approved by the city planner and recorded prior to issuance of a building permit this agreement must be recorded as a deed restriction on both properties and cannot be modified or revoked without the consent of the city planner if any requirements for shared parking are violated the

three settings parking lots streetscapes and walkways and at the edges of a site in all three cases a thematic approach to landscape design can enhance the pedestrian environment unify the different elements of the project and impart a welldefined character and image landscaping shall be provided in accordance with all landscaping screening and buffer requirements of the udc with an emphasis placed on the appearance of the site from rightsofway and from any adjoining residential uses within or outside of the mixed use development 2 required parking lot screening requirements shall apply to both perimeter and internal streets surface parking spaces shall be screened from rightofway views to a minimum height of fortytwo 42 inches above street elevation by the use of berms plantings andor decorative structures 3 use of screening structures in lieu of plantings the use of structures such as masonry walls or ornamental fencing for streetside parking lot screening purposes shall be permitted in lieu of plantings structures shall be a minimum of fortytwo inches 42 in height from street elevation 4 in order to encourage infill and redevelopment in mixed use districts on constrained sites containing less than ten 10 acres and bordered by developed land along the entire perimeter excluding intervening public streets the following exceptions to the parking lot landscaping requirements above are available to such infill and redevelopment occurring in an olderestablished contextual area  the city planner may reduce the 20% landscaping requirement up to fifty percent 50% of landscaping requirements provided that trees planted along the site perimeter also serve to screen and shade the interior of the parking lot and fully buffer any protected use 5 tree preservation as administrative relief the preservation of valuable protected or heritage trees may serve as a credit in lieu of required shade trees as provided in the udc 6 all screening and buffering requirements of the udc shall be fully applicable outdoor storage where permitted shall be fully screened and shall only be permitted on a dust free surface material 7 required street trees in mixed use zone districts may be located in the public rightofway at locations that will not damage sidewalks curbs street or utility improvements street trees shall be planted along all streets in a mixed use district k use context and use transitions one essential element to provide for the long term success and viability of mixed use districts in the city is the provision of transitional uses and use context between different land uses this is essential to ensure public safety maintain livability for residential uses within mixed use districts and ensure the long term viability of the mixed use district transitional context sensitive measures are also essential to ensure that a mixed use district will not adversely affect the viability of existing or proposed uses outside of but adjoining a mixed use district appropriate transition measure between variable land uses within and outside of the mixed use development must be developed at the conceptual stage of developing a mixed use concept plan for that reason all mixed use concept plan must clearly designate the techniques that are proposed to provide appropriate transitions and to ensure that the mixed use development is contextually sensitive to existing development outside of the mixed use development 1 transitions can be provided by the developer by using any of the following techniques or by a combination of techniques  space distance  earthen landscaped berms  landscaping dense evergreen shrubs and a mix of trees in layers  decorative fenceswalls  decorative building designs quiet building sides limiting upper story windows  road tree line boulevard or parkway design  green belttree preserve common amenity area or a wet or dry stormwater pond or linear park  reduced building heightbuilding bulk stepdowns  land use transitions from higher to lower use intensities  implement greenleed design concepts  building layout and screening techniques that confine or internalize impacts of more intensive uses on less intensives uses  innovative spatial land use planning techniques such as creating common areas or pedestrian ways between various intensities of land uses  any other alternative measures that will provide a suitable transition and ensure safety and compatibility between uses  limit uses to those businesses that generally operate between 8 am to 5 pm disallowing uses with outdoor operations and other activities in certain use areas or limiting any other operational aspects of development transitions between adjacent land uses with different intensities are typically achieved toback building orientation attractive building design large distances between uses and landscaped buffer areas per 310 accordingly the following standards and guidelines encourage the use of alternative transition tools including sitebuilding transitions such as reducing the scale of commercial building mass next to residential and development of less intense land uses between commercial and singlefamily residential areas such as lowerintensity office civicopen space or multifamily land uses limited operational compatibility standards are offered as a tool to further ease transitions from more intense to less intense land uses landscaped buffers walls and fences are used only when these other alternative transitions are not effective or not possible given site conditions and constraints or not desirable given prevailing development patterns in a specific area 2 transitional standards a development of a more intensive land use adjacent to an existing planned or zoned lessintensive land use either inside or outside the mixed use district boundary the city planner shall have the authority to make a final determination regarding relative intensity of adjacent land uses taking into consideration at a minimum the relative size design operations and traffic generation patterns of the adjacent land uses  and b require mitigation techniques to mitigate negative impacts uses or activities on a project that as determined by the city planner could reasonably be regarded as a nuisance for neighbors c transitional determinations made the city planner may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission 3 general transition tool guidelines a when a transition tool is required an applicant shall incorporate site and building transition tools greenopen space transition tools and transition uses before using landscape buffers or screens b the following are approaches methods and techniques that are permitted transition tools under this part  site and building transition tools including but not limited to building setbacks as established by surrounding development building placement and orientation as established by surrounding development similar building height similar building width similar roof form similar building materials and facade articulation  greenopen space transition tools including but not limited to the use of courts squares parks and plazas and use of natural features such as topography waterways and existing stands of trees  transition uses and other community serving uses as transitions such as but not limited to the transition uses and siting lesser intensive uses at the perimeter of the mixed use district  parkways streets and streetscapes   operational standards and  landscape buffers and screens c mixed use development should employ the following techniques as applicable to ensure compatibility with surrounding development for purposes of these transition tools the term surrounding development shall mean 1 immediately adjacent development on the same block face or on facing blocks as the subject site as well as 2 prevalent patterns established in the existing neighborhood located within onequarter mile of the subject development site d use similar building setbacks as established by surrounding development  e use similar building placement and orientation as prevalent in surrounding development  f use similar building height as exists for immediately adjacent development eg step down the building height of the more intensive land use to approximately match the building height of an adjacent less intensive land use  g use similar building width as prevalent in surrounding development  h use similar roof form and building materials as found on immediately adjacent development  i mitigate the larger mass of commercial civic and industrial buildings with faade articulation  j use fronttofront nonresidential to residential building orientations especially with commercial uses that are pedestrian intensive eg restaurants banks  k orient land uses with potentially adverse impacts features or uses away from neighboring uses for example avoid placing garages parking lots or service areas facing the fronts of neighboring buildings 4 greenopen space transitions mixed use development may employ the following techniques to provide transitions and ensure compatibility with surrounding development  use small green spaces courts squares parks plazas and similar spaces as transition areas that can also function as community gathering places  use existing natural features as transitions including natural differences in topography not retaining walls streams existing stands of trees and similar features when existing natural features are used as transitions the city may still require that adequate pedestrian connections to adjacent land uses be accommodated 5 transition uses and other communityserving uses as transitions  an applicant may site a transition use as specified on the mixed use concept plan or any other similar use as transitions to lower intensity adjacent uses such as residential  for example when office smallscale retail pedestrianintensive retail civic or public uses are planned as part of the same development containing more intensive commercial uses the applicant may site the less intensive uses or more communityserving uses as transitions to lower intensity adjacent uses such as residential banks and restaurantsall of which are communityserving usesmay be sited next to andor fronting adjacent mediumdensity residential uses 6 parkways streets and streetscapes the distance and separation afforded by the public rightofway together with similar or the same type of streetscape improvements on both sides of parkway or street may be utilized as a transition to adjacent development 7 landscape buffers and screening transitions where application of the transitions tools listed above are not possible or where the city planner determines these transition tools by themselves do not create an adequate transition to or buffer for less intensive land uses the landscape buffer and screening requirements of the udc may be utilized 8 operational compatibility standard the city planner may impose conditions that impose operational compatibility standards or accept formally recorded deeds restrictions and covenants that regulate discretionary development actions of end users to ensure that development in a mixed use zone district will be compatible with existing and planned neighborhoods and uses including but not limited to conditions regarding the following  the availability or ability to develop specific uses otherwise allowed by the udc   hours of operation   hours of deliveries and other similar uses   location intensity and hours of operation of exterior lighting including security lighting   placement of trash receptacles   amplification of music in a place of entertainment   location of delivery and loading zones  and  placement and illumination of outdoor vending machines 9 transitions along the public rightofway a within a mixed use zone district or other commercial center or mixed use development vehicle drivers on the adjacent public rightsofway should be able to recognize the increased presence of pedestrians and bicyclists who in turn should perceive the improved accommodation of alternatemode travel and increased personal safety in these places b incorporate medians and islands into streets for pedestrian refuge  c enhance midblock and intersection crosswalks with respect to paving treatments signal activation curb cuts and similar elements  and d integrate a sidewalk and pedestrian walkway system into the developments onsite circulation patterns emphasis should be placed on connections between front doors parking and transit l signage signage in a mixed use center is important not only for effectively guiding vehicular and pedestrian circulation but also for establishing a project identity locational directional and tenant signage provide necessary orientation for users it is also important for marketing the various uses and creating a positive image of the development signage that is designed according to a theme consistent with the overall design of the development serves to unify the center 1 the signage in a mixed use center is to be coordinated to provide a unified signage design signage is to be planned to clearly identify different use areas complement the pedestrian nature of the center and shall be integrated to complement the architectural consistency with the overall design of the building that the sign identifies or of the center the unified sign design elements should identify a recognizable character for sign design that contributes to the character of the center signs should reflect the character of materials illumination sizes proportions and locations 2 signs should be carefully integrated within the site landscape and architectural design context within which they are located size shape and proportions should be compatible with the size and scale of the surroundings and should not compete with or obscure other design features of the site landscape or structures signage should also provide attractive and appropriately placed designation of primary entrances 3 in the vicinity of residential uses lighting should be reduced or extinguished during nonbusiness hours or at a certain hour in the evening to reduce adverse impacts of commercial lighting on residential use internally illuminated signs or awnings are generally discouraged m roadwaystransportation mixed use centers will incorporate all modes of transportation motorized vehicles bicycles and pedestrians both safely and efficiently by meeting the design standards outlined in the udc and cibolo design and construction manual since mixed use developments tend to create higher traffic impacts than those that are strictly residential mixed use centers will be limited to locations along arterial and collector streets with the crossstreet for an arterial being no less than a collector this will minimize the impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods 1 access and connectivity access and connectivity for all modes of transportation is key to developing viable mixed use centers access to mixed use centers needs to be safe for both vehicles and pedestrians mixed use centers must also maintain good connectivity and safe pedestrian crossings while not overburdening the regional transportation system with traffic signals the following access standards are to be met for a mixed use development a a minimum of one access point per property ownership shall be permitted which may be jointly shared with adjacent properties b signalized access will only be allowed where approved by the city engineer based on the recommendations of an approved tia and in accordance with all aashto standards and only when traffic impacts are forecast to meet signal warrants as identified in the manual on uniform traffic control devices mutcd pedestrian signals will be allowed when traffic andor pedestrian impacts are forecast by the traffic study to meet signal warrants as defined in the mutcd the installation of traffic and pedestrian signals for proposed development will not be the responsibility of the city c to determine the placement of a signalized access when warrants are met a progression analysis shall be conducted within a traffic study for existing plus site generated traffic and for twentyyear horizon conditions in order to meet city standards for traffic flow along an arterial or collector street corridor d signalized access will only be allowed for streets constructed to city standards e mixed use developments will be based on a block structure to provide connectivity and to allow block length combinations that will provide flexibility in providing pedestrian access and signalized access when warranted block lengths as measured from curb face to curb face will be a minimum of two hundred 200 feet and a maximum of six hundred 600 feet with the average of all block lengths in a mixeduse development not to exceed five hundred 500 feet no vehicular access will be allowed into mixed use centers within six hundred 600 feet of two intersecting principal arterials or higher classified roadways pedestrian andor bicycle access into the site will be required within two hundred 200 feet of two intersecting principal arterials f left or rightturn storage lanes may be required along arterials or parkways and along entryspine streets that provide access to a mixed use center the specific design of such lanes shall be based on twentyyear traffic projections for that roadway and meet the guidelines outlined in the cibolo udc and design and construction manual g driveways that provide access to parking lots from perimeter streets into mixed use centers shall be of sufficient length to allow vehicles to enter the center and not be obstructed from onsite conflicts in which traffic queues onto the public or private street system the greater the peak hour traffic demand for the mixed use center the longer the unobstructed driveway must be the unobstructed length shall be measured from the back of the sidewalk or the stop bar exiting the site to the first intersection back of curb or parking drive aisle the minimum driveway lengths are as follows h pedestrian access shall consist of sidewalks and an onsite system of pedestrian walkways as identified in both the pedestrian assessment portion of the traffic study and in the pedestrian circulation plan submitted as part of the mixed use concept plan sidewalks and onsite walkways shall provide direct continuous access between the intended points of travel specifically pedestrian connections shall be provided to and between the following points  from parking to the primary entrance or entrances to each building housing a principal use  any sidewalk or walkway on adjacent properties that extends to the boundaries shared with the development  any public sidewalk system along the perimeter streets adjacent to the development site and  any public amenities i all sidewalks pedestrian walkways or trails shall have and maintain a minimum unobstructed pathway width of six 6 feet and be detached from the back of curb unless otherwise referenced 2 pedestrian environment following are the pedestrian standards to be maintained for a mixeduse development a a pedestrian assessment study will be conducted as part of the traffic study for a mixed use center in addition to the other information required as part of the traffic study the pedestrian assessment shall provide information on estimated hourly pedestrian and vehicular traffic for the mixed use development b entryspine streets shall be required for all mixed use developments entryspine streets are intended to provide the main access from arterial streets into the center and are intended to identify that a motorist has entered a unique area entryspine streets are also intended to concentrate and provide a safe route for pedestrian and bicycle ingress and egress into and out of the mixed use development a clear sight distances free from obstructions must be maintained to allow vehicles to safely make turns at intersections and for pedestrians to have adequate time to cross the street therefore the udc site distance requirements will be applied to proposed projects intersection design shall meet mutcd guidelines and may include enhanced crosswalks with directional ramps pavement treatment median refuge islands and pedestrian indicators b pedestrian refuge areas or medians will be required on all roadways classified as major collector and above c all pedestrian crossings shall comply with the standards set forth in the americans with disabilities act ada udc or cibolo design and construction manual whichever is the stricter rule pedestrian ramps shall be oriented directionally only d delineated crosswalks with patterned surface can be effective traffic control devices  however they should not be used indiscriminately it has been shown that pedestrians may develop a false sense of security regarding their use of a marked location and step into the crossing without adequately checking for oncoming vehicles information from the pedestrian assessment will be evaluated based on aashto standards and generally accepted transportation engineering standards n utilities the design of a mixed use development is to occur in a comprehensive manner where land uses site layout utility corridors landscaping lighting and other infrastructure are designed in concert with one another this will especially apply to utility design work where advance planning and layout will facilitate construction operation and maintenance both from a functional and aesthetic standpoint when submitting the mixed use concept plan the following information shall be provided  a plan identifying the points of interconnection for water wastewater gas and electric  a map showing the general corridor and

streets upgrade existing traffic signals new traffic signal construction other improvements identified in the tia rightofway dedication and construction of left andor right turn lanes b for phased development projects implementation of the mitigation improvements must be completed no later than the completion of the project phase for which the tia shows it was required plats for project phases subsequent to a phase for which a mitigation improvement is required may be approved only if the mitigation improvements are completed or bonded by the developer c following the identification of mitigation improvements and any other improvements necessitated by and attributable to the development the applicant shall utilize the methodology developed and approved by the city to determine if the mitigation improvements identified are roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed development 1 at the conclusion of the tia the applicant will summarize all of the mitigation improvements identified in the tia and the approximate total cost of all mitigation improvements including design engineering and construction mitigation improvements that only serve the proposed development such as site plan related recommendations and rightturn lanes into and out of a development that provide minimal benefits to the study area roadway network shall not be included in the cost of the mitigation improvements when compared to the maximum amount of improvements attributable to the proposed development 2 the applicant will utilize the approved methodology made available by the city to determine the maximum amount of improvements measured in dollars that may be attributable to the proposed development 3 the applicant shall then compare the cost of the mitigation improvements to the maximum probable amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development a if the cost of the mitigation improvements is less than or equal to the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development then the mitigation improvements identified in the traffic impact analysis are said to be roughly proportionate to the impact of the development b if the cost of the mitigation improvements is greater than the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development then the mitigation improvements identified in the traffic impact analysis are limited to an amount roughly equal to the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development 4 the methodology utilized by the city shall be as follows the maximum amount of improvements attributable to a development is roughly proportional to the demand created by a development this value shall be determined measured in dollars by multiplying the following values together a intensity of the development using independent variable identified in the ite trip generation manual eg number of dwelling units number of one thousand 1000 square feet of leasable floor area etc  b number of vehiclesthe peak hour trip generation rate for the applicable peak hour from the most current version of the ite trip generation manual information  c length of the tripthe anticipated trip length tofrom the development on the citys thoroughfare network a minimum value of 10 miles and a maximum value of 15 miles shall apply  and d cost per vehiclemilethe average cost per vehiclemile for the city to deliver a typical roadway capacity improvement project based upon the current city engineer estimates the average unit price list shall be reviewed by the city engineer on a regular basis to ensure the average unit price list is consistent with current construction costs 5 the methodology shall be reviewed by the city engineer on a regular basis to ensure the methodology is consistent with current construction costs and engineering criteria 6 projects in a valid master development plan or planned unit development where mitigation improvements have been previously constructed at the cost of the applicant shall receive credit for these improvements the credit for improvements shall be determined using the cost of the improvements at the time they were constructed this value shall be included with the total cost of the mitigation improvements required to serve the development the land uses previously constructed or planned for shall also be included in the calculation of the maximum probable amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development d limitations on traffic impact mitigation  limitations on traffic impact mitigation requirements are as follows 1 improvements that have been planned and funded capital improvement project that exceed the proposed mitigation measures recommended in the tia are not required the capital improvement must be planned to be awarded to a contractor for construction within one 1 year following the completion of the project phase requiring the improvement to be considered as a mitigation improvement e exemptions  the city finds and determines that certain factors such as interconnected street systems mixed uses and the availability of pedestrian facilities can result in fewer trips than isolated lowdensity subdivisions certain development patterns produce fewer trips and shorter trips than developments subject to conventional zoning or

along with the preliminary plat the city engineer shall review the submission and verify that all udc requirements have been met h downstream drainage assessment  downstream drainage assessment shall extend from the outfall of the subdivision to a point downstream determined by one of two methods  zone of influence  point downstream where the discharge from a proposed development no longer has a significant impact upon the receiving stream or storm drainage system  adequate outfall  location of acceptable outfall that does not create adverse flooding or erosion conditions downstream these methods recognize the fact that a structural control providing detention has a zone of influence downstream where its effectiveness can be felt beyond this zone of influence the stormwater effects of a structural control become relatively small and insignificant compared to the runoff from the total drainage area at that point based on studies and master planning results for a large number of sites a general rule of thumb is that the zone of influence can be considered to be the point where the drainage area controlled by the detention or storage facility comprises 10% of the total drainage area this is known as the 10% rule as an example if a structural control drains 10 acres the zone of influence ends at the point where the total drainage area is 100 acres or greater the downstream assessment shall include the following steps 1 determine the outfall location of the site and the pre and postdevelopment site conditions 2 using a topographic map determine a preliminary lower limit of the zone of influence using the 10% rule 3 using a hydrologic model determine the predevelopment peak flows and velocities at each junction beginning at the development outfall and

submitted to the city for review and approval fill a identification of existingproposed fill during platting fill is frequently a factor in the construction of public improvements and foundation construction fill may be placed on a site at various times as a requirement of the platting process construction plans shall be submitted that clearly indicate which lots will be filled and which lots have existing fill the types of existing fill and proposed fill shall be identified on all preliminary and final plats construction plans shall propose and develop a strategy for dealing with fills early on in the construction process b geotechnical report required for all development fill may exist between borings or be undetected during the geotechnical investigation the investigation is more accurate if borings are more closely spaced consequently a geotechnical report prepared by a professional engineer licensed by the state of texas and qualified to practice geotechnical engineering shall be required for every building lot including singlefamily residential for residential development foundations shall be designed in accordance with recommended practice for the design of residential foundations version 2 as may be amended by the texas society of civil engineers and in accordance with the city building as may be amended c requirements for fill type fill is generally can be divided into three types engineered fill forming fill and uncontrolled fill these three types and requirement of the city for each is described below 1 engineered fill engineered fill is designed by an engineer to act as a structural element of a constructed work and is placed under engineering inspection with density testing engineered fill may be embankment fill composed of the material randomly found on the site or imported to no particular specification other than that it be free of debris and trash or may be select fill embankment fill can be used many situations if it is properly placed and compacted the term select simply means that the material meets some specification as to gradation and pi and possibly some other material specifications if engineered fill is proposed a fill report shall be submitted for city engineer approval addressing the following 1 fill composition report and fill design specifications 2 proposed density inspection and testing schedule 3 fill compaction detail showing lift depths and proposed densities 4 gradation requirements 5 underslab details if applicable 6 list requirements for fill placement geometry material compaction and quality control 2 forming fill forming fill is that which is typically used under residential foundation slabs and is variously known as sandy loam river loam or fill dirt forming fill is normally not expected to be heavily compacted and a designer should not rely on this material for support the only requirements are that this material be nonexpansive clean and that it works easily and stands when cut if forming fill happened to be properly compacted and inspected in accordance with an engineering specification it could be engineered fill 3 uncontrolled fill uncontrolled fill is fill that has been determined to be unsuitable or has not been proven suitable to support a slabonground foundation any fill that has not been approved by a qualified geotechnical engineer in writing shall be considered uncontrolled fill uncontrolled fill may contain undesirable materials andor has not been placed under compaction control some problems resulting from uncontrolled fill include gradual settlement sudden collapse attraction of wood ants and termites corrosion of metallic plumbing pipes and in some rare cases site contamination with toxic or hazardous wastes d building on nonengineered fill forming or uncontrolled foundations shall not be supported by nonengineered fill  to establish soil supported foundations on nonengineered fill the typical grid beam stiffened slab foundation is required to penetrate the nonengineered fill with the perimeter and interior beam bottoms forming footings penetration will take the load supporting elements of the foundation below the unreliable fill penetration could be accomplished by deepened beams spread footings or piers depending on the depth and the economics of the situation generally piers are most cost effective once the fill to be penetrated exceeds about three feet but this depends on the foundation engineers judgment and local practice floor systems shall be designed to span between structurally supported foundation elements preexisting fill may be classified as engineered fill after investigation by the geotechnical engineer the approval may depend on the fill thickness existence of trash and debris the age of the fill and the results of testing and proof rolling the geotechnical engineer must be able to expressly state after investigation that the fill is capable of supporting a residential slabonground foundation article 20  subdivision regulations general  short title  this be known cited and referred to as the city of cibolo subdivision regulations  definitions  applicable definitions

provided in support of a capital improvement plan which is necessary to calculate the 2007 wastewater impact fees this plan has been developed to meet the projected wastewater needs for the next 10 years all wastewater flows are derived from land use projections provided by the city of cibolo the capital improvements criteria for this evaluation generally apply to gravity lines over 8 diameters force mains and lift stations no capital improvement costs are associated with the treatment plant these fees are developed separately by cibolo creek municipal authority ccma and will be passed on to all its customers cibolo assesses impact fees associated with necessary improvements to its collection system which come in addition to ccmas impact fees the citys existing wastewater system was modeled to determine the existing level of service there are currently 4716 living unit equivalents lues in the citys wastewater service area future land use assumptions were established to guide future system improvement needs there will be 27222 lues in the citys water service area by 2017 nineteen capital improvement projects totaling $21353048 are necessary to accommodate the 22506 lues attributable to growth not including eligible finance costs as allowed under local government lgc  b or the alternative 50% credit described under lgc $7b the initial impact fee is calculated to be

within the service area and the costs to upgrade update improve expand or replace the improvements to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety efficiency and environmental or regulatory standards in addition this appendix provides an analysis of the total capacity level of current usage and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing capital improvements 21 relationship to other entities as indicated previously the city of cibolo does not provide treatment services for wastewater this function is provided in an agreement with cibolo creek municipal authority ccma which owns and operates the regional wastewater treatment facility city of cibolo wastewater flows to the ccma treatment plant via two routes one is the loop 539 lift station which is located inside the city limits and pumps the effluent to the ccma regional plant the other is lines that generally flow west city of schertz since the city does not operate the ccma treatment plant the wastewater infrastructure evaluated in this plan are the major collection lines and lift stations that transport all flows to the loop 539 lift station no capital improvements were considered for the portion of the network that flows city of schertz since this portion of the city is builtout also the capital improvements plan cip does not include any oversizing to serve areas outside of the planning area 22 wastewater collection system the existing collection system consists of 624 diameter pipes most of these are pvc however some of the older pipes and service laterals are concrete or clay replacement of these lines is not an eligible impact fee expenditure and will have to be replaced or repaired as a maintenance project appendix a is a map of the existing collection system although the system contains pipes less than 8 diameter only those lines greater than 8 were evaluated 23 existing lift stations the city currently owns and operates two lift stations willowbridge and cibolo vista each station is sufficient to serve the existing area flowing into each as they were sized to accommodate the developments that they serve the loop 539 lift station is owned and operated by ccma 24 determination of existing flows flows are not metered at any point in cibolos collection system ccma charges a treatment fee based upon water use data it is not possible to evaluate winter averages to determine wastewater flow because the city of cibolos water service area is not coterminous with its wastewater service area recall that portions of the city are served by green valley sud therefore the existing flow rate per living unit equivalency lue must be estimated based on the water consumption rate per lue the water system impact fee study  master plan was prepared at the same time as this study and derived 361 gallons per day per lue based on an evaluation of seasonal water use patterns the wastewater flow per lue was determined by using 75% of the water demand rate per lue 361 gallons per day and is calculated to be 271 gallons per day per lue 361 gpdlue x 075   271 gpdlue 25 determination of number of living unit equivalencies within the city of cibolos wastewater service area there are 4716 existing wastewater customers therefore there are currently 4716 lues within the citys service area 30  existing system hydraulic analysis in order to determine the improvements required to meet existing needs a hydraulic analysis was performed 31 analysis technique  method of analysis a computer hydraulic model infoworks was developed to assess the capacity of the citys collection system infoworks software is a gisbased platform that incorporates standard engineering algorithms and enables timeseries flow data to assess capacities and restrictions  system model and flow allocation the existing collection system was imported into the hydraulic modeling software pipelines with diameters smaller than 8 were not modeled existing wastewater flows were calculated according to the flow rate per lue see section 24 and allocated to different nodes in the system based on known flow patterns and land use 1 platted lots were assumed to be occupied for the purposes of flow allocation since they represent a commitment to current capacity a free outfall at the loop 539 lift station wet well was assumed 2 1 nodes are points within the network such as junctions or manholes in some instances these nodes mark the point that flows are introduced into the network 2 the free outfall assumption means that the wet well of the lift station is sufficiently sized such that the level in the wet well never exceeds the incoming flowlines of the wastewater mains creating a tailwater condition at the pipe outfall  planning and design criteria the design criteria utilized in the model were developed from state standards known existing system characteristics and generally accepted engineering principles the criteria are summarized in the following table table 1

operation personnel and city staff 40  10year capital improvements program the purpose of this section is to provide a description of the capital improvements and their costs necessitated by and

figures figure 1 town creek watershed 10  introduction 11 purpose of this study the 2007 drainage capital improvements plan for the city of cibolo has been developed so that the drainage capacity for the municipality can be met for the next 10 years the plan was developed by espey consultants inc with guidance from city staff and the impact fee committee appointed by city council the plan should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis in connection with updates to the city master plan or other planning documents or as needed to reflect changing conditions 12 description of the planning area figure 1 town creek watershed for the purposes of this study the planning area is defined by the town creek watershed the dietz creek drainage system serving the western portion of the city has been built to its capacity figure 1 shows the town creek watershed 20  existing town creek drainage system the purpose of this appendix is to provide a description of the existing capital improvements within the service area and the costs to upgrade update improve expand or replace the improvements to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety efficiency environmental or regulatory standards in addition this appendix provides an analysis of the total capacity level of current usage and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing capital improvements 21 methodology in order to determine the capacity of the existing town creek drainage system a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis was performed details of the analysis and methodology are found in the report city of cibolo flood protection plan a master plan for managing town creek  espey consultants inc the results of this study indicate that improvements are necessary to provide a 25year level of flood protection in several existing problem areas consequently improvements are also necessary in some areas to provide a 100year level of protection this study determined that in some areas a 100year level of protection was not costjustified for this reason a 100year level of protection criterion is not uniformly applied throughout the watershed  rather the highest level of protection 25year or 100year that can reasonably be achieved is the criterion for which improvements have been considered for 22 impervious cover hard surfaces which do not permit the absorption of rainfall into the soil thus resulting in increased stormwater runoff are known as impervious cover impervious cover is the basic quantifiable and common unit that creates the need for drainage improvements there are currently 49964782 square feet of impervious cover in the town creek watershed 23 living unit equivalency to determine the amount of impervious cover attributable to a living unit equivalency a typical r2b zoned lot was evaluated and calculated to account for approximately 3462 square feet of impervious surfaces this includes impervious surfaces that are placed on the lot as well as some that are within the rightofway but attributable to the unit such as the driveway apron curb and pavement measured to the road centerline for the width of the property based on this calculation there are 11055 existing lues in the service area 30  10year capital improvements program the purpose of this section is to provide a description of the capital improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area over the next ten years this section also defines the specific quantity of impervious cover for a service unit and provides an equivalency table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses including residential commercial and industrial 31 future land use assumptions future impervious cover is determined by future land use assumptions these assumptions were defined in workshops with city staff the impact fee committee the planning and zoning commission and the city council the intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire citys planning area which extends beyond the water service area and determine the most likely balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 20072017 residential and nonresidential land use classifications are indicated as follows on the attached copy of the future land use assumptions map appendix a residential uses indicate the future density in terms of

cibolo the capital improvements plan cip consists of various roadway projects proposed in order to provide safe transportation alternatives designed to accommodate the citys growth over a tenyear period the plan should be updated annually to account for any changes in the transportation master plan or as needed to reflect changing conditions cost estimates were used in conjunction with living unit equivalents lue based on land use assumptions to develop a method for applying impact fees existing and future lues will benefit from the improvements and therefore the cost is distributed across the total number of lues both existing and projected for the tenyear period the impact fee study has established two zones the north zone consists of those areas within the city limits of cibolo north of sh 78 there will be 38504 lues within the north zone with 27 cip projects totaling $11274178604 planned to accommodate the lues the south zone consists of those areas within the city limits of cibolo south of sh 78 there will be 11867 lues within the south zone with five cip projects totaling $1265274040 proposed to accommodate the lues including the eligible finance costs as allowed under tex local government b and the alternative 50% credit described under tex local government 7b the impact fees per lue is calculated to be $146402 for the north zone and $53310 for the south zone 11

located in guadalupe county and bexar county because there are locations within the city limits which are more than six miles from some of the proposed cip projects the transportation impact fees are calculated based on two zones the north zone consists of the areas within the city limits north of sh 78 the south zone consists of the areas within the city limits south of sh 78 cost estimates were made based on roadway lengths inside the city limits construction outside the city limits was not included in the cost estimates any cip projects lying on the edge of the city limits were proportioned between the city of cibolo and the bordering jurisdictions costs for cip projects located on sh 78 were divided between the north and south zones 20  population and land use projections future transportation demand is determined by future land use assumptions the future land uses were determined during three previous impact fee studies prepared for the city of cibolo by espey consultants inc the following is an excerpt from those reports regarding the future land uses the assumptions were defined in workshops with city staff the impact fee advisory committee the planning and zoning commission and the city council the intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire citys planning area which extends beyond the service area and determine the most likely balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 20072017 the anticipated growth pattern of the city in terms of the location use and intensity of the use is based upon the following considerations  average annual residential building permit growth of 4% for the period 20032007   average annual sales tax revenue growth of 31% for the period 20032007   populations projections of the 2005 master plan   trend of higher consumer expenditures per household closer to cibolos center relative to greater distances from the citys center   retail and commercial uses are anticipated along state highways and major intersections in response to the population growth and anticipated demand for services  the citys largest private employers have announced plans to expand their operations and hire additional workforce  the availability of utilities and regional transportation infrastructure  the location of floodplains railroads and similar constraints  the application of prudent land use planning principles such as the transition of use intensity and the creation of a center of high activity 21 future land use future land use assumptions were developed by city staff based on desired development patterns for cibolo different land use areas are shown on the aerial map located in appendix d and described as follows attached residential the attached residential land use areas were assumed to be town homes ranging from six to twelve dwelling units per acre the acreage multiplied by the dwelling units per acre determined the amount of total dwelling units for a specific region where dwelling units were not specified a value of 8 dwelling units per acre was assumed an average value of 586  trips per dwelling unit per day was used for trip calculations cluster cluster residential development is characterized by denser areas of development and larger areas of setaside open space resulting in a low overall average density cluster areas were assumed to contain two dwelling units per acre and trip calculations follow the same assumptions as singlefamily detached residences using an average of 957  trips per dwelling unit per day commercial commercial land use areas were assumed to be shopping centers with approximately 20% of the area as gross leasable commercial land acreages were converted into units of 1000 square feet of gross leasable area gla and trips generated were calculated using the average value of 4294  trips per 1000 sq feet  gross leasable area per day based on these areas institutional institutional areas were determined to be used for elementary middlejunior high or high school uses the trip productions were based on assumed number of students for each type of school with 850 1500 and 2800 students at elementary junior high and high school respectively singlefamily this land use area was classified as singlefamily detached housing with an average trip generation of 957 trips per dwelling unit per day the number of dwelling units per acre was provided for a majority of the areas where none was provided a value of 4 dwelling units was assumed mixed use the mixed use regions were split into 25% retail 30% residential 15% office 10% commercial 10% publiccivic and 10% institutional areas the office buildings were assumed to be multistory and the retail area was classified as a specialty retail center for trip generation purposes the assumed percentages were based on experience and prior knowledge of land development desires of cibolo trips were calculated using the same averages for the specialized areas mentioned previously mixed use assumes ratio identified in table 20 city of cibolo master plan industrial industrial zones were assumed to be industrial parks with acreage used for trip production calculations this land use produces an average of 6311  trips per acre per day table 1 shows average trip generation values for each land use as seen in the institute of transportation engineers trip generation

limited to an area within the corporate boundaries of the political subdivision and shall not exceed six miles tex local government 9 the area considered in this analysis includes all areas and roadways within the city of cibolo limits which is split into two service areas due to the inequality of development and project locations the overall planning area was divided into north and south zones for impact fee determination there are a total of 30 projects included in the 10year capital improvements transportation program with 25 projects in the north 4 projects in the south and one

streets built with open ditches these roads are out of date with many roads lacking striping and the capacity to carry the traffic loads created by the current population there is a need for expansion on most collector streets possibly the development of these roads into minor arterials is necessary as the roadways are expanded curb and gutter and storm drain systems should be installed the existing cityowned transportation network contains little to no facilities for pedestrian or cyclist traffic so expansion also calls for an inclusion of sidewalks and some bike lanes to accommodate nonauto traffic in addition the city of cibolo is served by state and federal roadways ih 35 ih 10 sh 78 fm 3009 and fm 1103 ih 35 and fm 3009 are roadways bordering the city of cibolo for only short distances sh 78 traverses across the city from east to west and is a fourlane roadway with a center left turn lane for most of the distance city fm 1103 is a primary access point for the city of cibolo and currently consists of a twolane roadway with minimal shoulders for most of the distance ih 10 is within the etj south of the current cibolo city limits the only state or federal funding currently projected for any of these roadways within the city of cibolo is funding for row purchase along fm 1103 therefore any needed expansion along these roadways has been included in the cip program 32 relationship to other entities the city of cibolo shares a border with the city of schertz where it was applicable the roadway projects along these borders were proportioned equally between the two cities only the cost applicable to the city of cibolo was included in impact fee determination 33 existing signalization within the city there are four locations in need of new signalization flashing light signals or stop signs currently exist at these locations these facilities do not adequately move traffic and create congestion during peak hours turn lanes have been included at the intersections as needed 40  10year capital improvements program the 10year capital improvements program involves planning design construction and funding of 30 transportation projects in order to equip the city with the means to provide adequate levels of service los for its growing developments increasing development especially singlefamily housing will result in more traffic on the roads which creates a demand for an increase in the capacity of the citys existing roads 41 transportation master plan the primary objective of the transportation master plan is to increase mobility efficiency and safety of cibolos roadway system a transportation master plan was completed as part of the city of cibolo  update to the master plan espey consultants inc january 2005 this master plan identified the need for expansion of several existing roadways and the construction of new sections of road all street constructions and upgrades will be designed as curb and gutter streets to improve drainage from the road all roadway sections were also designed to equip four foot side walks on both sides of the road designated hikebike facilities in addition to sidewalks included in estimates have not been accounted for pending completion of a parks and trails master plan 42 capital improvements the projects included in the cip program are all included in the transportation master plan many of the projects were carried forward from the 2007 cip program and projects 39 were added due to planned development needs and changing in state and federal funding availability  signalization planned development is expected to meet signal warrants to justify signal installation for cip projects 37 38 39 and 40 in addition to the signal installation turn lanes at new signals were included where needed signalization and additional turn lanes are intended to increase circulation around retail developments as stated in the citys master plan  roadway improvements and expansions several roadway improvements and expansions are needed to increase mobility and ease of access to the town center as is desired by the citys master plan existing roadways will be expanded to thoroughfare rightofway widths no less than 66 to accommodate traffic from residential areas into the community center capital improvement project 45 includes the expansion of the existing schaefer road and approximately 400 feet of new bridge construction over a low water crossing the new bridge will provide mobility and emergency access to projected development the widening and addition of curb and gutter to existing roadways will require modification of the profile in order to provide adequate drainage to adjacent properties this will require reconstruction of the entire width of the roadways in most cases  new roadway construction there are four new roadway construction projects included in the 10year capital improvements program cip projects 51 include a future thoroughfare width of 150 feet which will continue the fm 1103 expansion and create a major arterial the extension of fm 1103 continues into the south zone and includes cip 50 in this region cip project 46 proposes an 86 foot wide thoroughfare linking fm 78 and cr 374 opening up a new access route to the center of town 43 cost estimates the cost of each project involves calculating the roadway construction cost the price of row and the cost of relocating existing utilities where applicable the construction costs are based on quantities estimated from typical sections and design experience typical sections for the various categories of roadway are included in appendix b the price of row varies based on project location and ranges from $700000 up to $3000000 per acre utility relocations are required when overhead poles are in direct conflict with a proposed road or when underground utilities are in conflict with new cross drainage facilities the cost of relocation varies depending on the type of utilities for example overhead electric lines cost approximately $750lf to move whereas underground waterlines cost about $6000lf for relocation construction see appendix c for a summary of all estimated costs and detailed calculations for each cip project 44 lue determination for transportation purposes one living unit equivalent lue is equal to a singlefamily dwelling unit future land use assumptions flua were used to determine how many vehicle trips per weekday would be generated at probable development of the city over the 10 year program period using the institute of traffic engineers ite trip generation manuals trip generations based on land use were calculated for all areas shown on the future land use map within the city limits the expected development for the tenyear cip period was determined by adjusting the lues calculated for each land use area with the probability of development for each area the probability of development was determined between espey consultants and city staff based on current development trends and provided to cobb fendley as part of base data for this study a summary of lues and detailed calculations based on land uses can be found in appendix e the number of trips calculated for each area was then divided by an average of 957 vehicle trips per singlefamily household per weekday to determine the lues for each area the north project zone has 38504 calculated lues and the south has 11867 total lues 50  maximum impact fee determination appendix a shows the derivation of the maximum fees for transportation for both the north zone and the south zone the proposed facility costs debt service costs for the proposed cip and engineering costs are shown as well as a 50% credit for the cip and the study the maximum
