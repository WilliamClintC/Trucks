town of rutland is implementing and requiring variable rate pricing charges for volume or weight of the waste collected this requirement to implement applies to all solid waste haulers and facilities that accept and collect msw from residential customers whereas variable rate pricing systems have been shown to be one of the most effective mechanisms for decreasing the disposal of solid waste increasing recycling and composting rates and increasing the diversion and reuse of valuable materials from the solid waste stream further variable rate pricing is more equitable or fair pricing for

residential customers shall charge these customers for this service on the basis of the volume or weight of the msw they produce which is a pricing system commonly referred to as variable rate pricing each service provided shall establish a unitbased price to be charged for the collection  dropoff disposal of each unit of msw from residential customers  for example a price per pound is a price for each 30gallon bag or 30gallon container that is collected or disposed of by a resident each larger unit of msw such as a 64gallon container or a 50gallon bag shall carry an independent price the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit any service provider from establishing rules and regulations regarding the safe maximum weight of bags or container which is overloaded

addition to the unitbased price charged for unit of msw service providers may but are not required to charge a flat fee to residential customers for the purpose of covering operational costs for
