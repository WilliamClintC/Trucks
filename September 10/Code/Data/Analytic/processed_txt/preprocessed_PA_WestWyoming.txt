calculation 40 rational formula 1 the rational formula used in calculating runoff is q cia in this equation q is the peak runoff in cubic feet per second c is a runoff coefficient which depends on the nature of the land cover i is the intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration for the drainage area involved and a is the watershed area in acres the time of concentration is the time required for runoff from the upper reaches of the watershed to reach the point for which runoff rates are being calculated b values of coefficient c 1 runoff

stormwater management ordinance ordinance no 6194 a r t i c l e 1 general provisions statement of findings the governing body of the county finds that inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety 46 b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of luzerne county and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment purpose the purpose of this to promote the public health safety and welfare within luzerne county watersheds by minimizing the damages described in a of the provisions designed to a control accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation

hardship the luzerne county planning commission may grant a waiver provided that all of the following findings are made in a given case a that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the approved stormwater plans maps and model ordinances in the stormwater management district in which the property is located  50 b that because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the approved stormwater
