every atlantic city resident has an equal right to a healthy and safe environment this requires that our air water land and food be of a sufficiently high standard that individuals and communities can live healthy fulfilling and dignified lives the duty to enhance protect and preserve atlantic citys environment rests on the shoulders of government residents citizen groups and businesses alike b historically environmentally harmful activities have only been stopped after they have manifested extreme environmental degradation or exposed people to harm in the case of pcbs ddt lead and asbestos for instance regulatory action took place only after disaster had struck the delay between first knowledge of harm and appropriate action to deal with it can be measured in human lives cut short c atlantic city is a leader in making choices based on the least environmentally harmful alternatives thereby challenging traditional assumptions about risk management the city will implement numerous ordinances which will include the integrated pest management the resource efficient building the healthy air the resource conservation the environmentally preferable purchasing order to obtain a precautionary approach to specific city purchases and activities internationally this model is called the precautionary principle d as the city builds a framework for future legislation the precautionary principle approach will serve as a policy framework to develop and implement laws for a healthier and more just atlantic city in this way the city will create and maintain a healthy viable community environment for current and future generations and will become a model of sustainability e science and technology are creating new solutions to prevent or mitigate environmental problems however science is also creating new compounds and chemicals that are already finding their way into mothers milk and causing other new problems new legislation may be required to address these situations and the precautionary principle is intended as a tool to help promote environmentally healthy alternatives while weeding out the negative and often unintended consequences of new technologies f a central element of the precautionary approach is the careful assessment of available alternatives using the best available science an alternatives assessment examines a broad range of options in order to present the public with the consequences of each approach the  21a1 general provisions  21a1   21a2 policy the following shall constitute the citys precautionary principle policy all officers boards commissions and departments of the city shall implement the precautionary principle in conducting the citys affairs the precautionary principle requires a thorough exploration and a careful analysis of a wide range of alternatives based on the best available science the precautionary principle requires the selection of the alternative that presents the least potential threat to human health and the citys natural systems public participation and an open and transparent decisionmaking process takes shortterm versus longterm effects or costs into consideration and evaluates and compares the adverse or potentially adverse effects of each option giving preference to those options with fewer potential hazards this process allows fundamental questions to be asked is this potentially hazardous activity necessary what less hazardous options are available and how little damage is possible g the alternatives assessment is also a public process because locally or internationally the public bears the ecological and health consequences of environmental decisions a governments course of action is necessarily enriched by broadly based public participation when a full range of alternatives is considered based on input from diverse individuals and groups the public should be able to determine the range of specific alternatives to be examined for each alternative the public should consider both immediate and longterm consequences as well as possible impacts to the local economy h this form of open decisionmaking is in line with atlantic citys historic sunshine act59 which allows citizens to have full view of the legislative process one of the goals of the precautionary principle is to include citizens as equal partners in decisions affecting their health and environment i atlantic city looks forward to the time when the citys power is generated from renewable sources when all our waste is recycled when our vehicles produce only potable water as emissions when the area is free from toxins and the oceans are free from pollutants the precautionary principle provides a means to help us attain these goals as we evaluate future laws and policies in such areas as transportation construction land use planning water energy health care recreation purchasing and public expenditure j transforming our society to realize these goals and achieving a society living respectfully within the bounds of nature will take a behavioral as well as technological revolution the precautionary approach to decisionmaking will help atlantic city speed this process of change by moving beyond finding cures for environmental ills to preventing the ills before they can do harm 59editors note see njsa 6 et seq  21a1 atlantic city code  21a2  process are critical to finding and selecting alternatives where threats of serious or irreversible damage to people or nature exist lack of full scientific certainty about cause and effect shall not be viewed as sufficient reason for the city to postpone costeffective measures to prevent the degradation of the environment or protect the health of its citizens any gaps in scientific data uncovered by the examination of alternatives will provide a guidepost for future research but will not prevent the city from taking protective action as new scientific data become available the city will review its decisions and make adjustments when warranted where there are reasonable grounds for concern the precautionary approach to decisionmaking is meant to help reduce harm by triggering a process to select the least potential threat the key elements of the precautionary principle approach to decisionmaking include  21a3 review no later than three years from the effective date of this article and after a public hearing the department of planning and development shall submit a report to the city council on the effectiveness of the precautionary principle policy a anticipatory action there is a duty to take anticipatory action to prevent harm government business and community groups as well as the general public share this responsibility b right to know the community has a right to know complete and accurate information on potential human health and environmental impacts associated with the selection of products services operations or plans the burden to supply this information lies with the proponent not with the general public c alternatives assessment an obligation exists to examine a full range of alternatives and select the alternative with the least potential impact on human health and the environment including the alternative of doing nothing d full cost accounting when evaluating potential alternatives there is a duty to consider all the reasonably foreseeable costs including raw materials manufacturing transportation precautionary principle policy statement use cleanup eventual disposal and health costs even if such costs are not reflected in the initial price short and longterm benefits and time thresholds should be considered when making decisions e participatory decision process decisions applying the precautionary principle must be transparent

the juvenile curfew act of 2006  1152 findings and purpose a the city council of the city of atlantic city council has determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence juvenile gang activity and crime by persons under the age of 18 years in the city of atlantic city and that much of said activity takes place during night and evening hours b the council has further determined that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents and guardians for persons under the age of 18 years resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior and illegal activities amended 792014 by  c the council has further determined that persons under the age of 18 years are particularly susceptible because of their lack of maturity and experience to involvement in unlawful activities and to be victims of perpetrators of crime d the council has further determined that the offensive and illegal activities of minors are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles amended 792014 by  e the council has further determined that a curfew for persons under the age of 18 years meets a local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in the city of atlantic city is particularly appropriate in view of the high population density and the mixed use of residential and commercial areas the regulation of juveniles is an attempt to minimize danger to juveniles and the community during nighttime hours when criminal activity is more prevalent amended 792014 by  f the council determines that passage of a curfew will protect the welfare of juveniles by amended 792014 by   11418 general provisions  1152   1153 definitions as

purpose a it is the purpose of this provide a unified set of procedures and standards to govern site plan and subdivision reviews in keeping with the spirit and structure of the new jersey municipal land use law275 and to simplify land use administration in the city of atlantic city this chapter makes no distinction between cases where subdivision approval is required and those where site plan approval is required rather for all developments made subject to site plan subdivision approval pursuant to  16381 below it is the purpose of the provisions of this article to assure that development will occur only as consistent with the master plan the capital improvements program the official map and this chapter and that adequate consideration will be given to critical ontract and offtract engineering planning and design elements so as to assure the least possible adverse effect upon and the greatest possible benefit to the public health safety and welfare as a result of public and

developments are permitted as of right as permitted uses in the zoning districts where proposed or require some special discretionary approval such as planned development conditional use or variance approval in cases where such discretionary approval is required the procedures of articles xix are designed to mesh with the procedures made applicable to such approvals by other articles of this that the applications for such approvals and for site plansubdivision approval will be processed concurrently without the need for separate notices or hearings c the standards made applicable by articles xix to all applications for site plan subdivision approval are intended as minimum standards to be met by all developments subject to review pursuant to articles xix are designed to assure that developments permitted as of right as permitted uses in the various zoning districts will be adequately planned designed and serviced to protect the public health safety and welfare where a
