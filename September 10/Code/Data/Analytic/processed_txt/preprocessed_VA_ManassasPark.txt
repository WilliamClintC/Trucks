the first year is forty thousand dollars $4000000 the amount exempt in each subsequent year would be reduced by ten thousand dollars $1000000 forty thousand dollars $4000000  four 4 so that in year 2 the amount exempt would be thirty thousand dollars $3000000  in year 3 the amount exempt would be twenty thousand dollars $2000000  and in year 4 the amount exempt would be ten thousand dollars $1000000 similarly if the additional assessed value exempt from real estate tax in the first year is eighty thousand dollars $8000000 the amount exempt in each subsequent year would be reduced by twenty thousand dollars $2000000 eighty thousand dollars $8000000  four 4 so that in year 2 the amount exempt would be sixty thousand dollars $6000000  in year 3 the amount exempt would be forty thousand dollars $4000000  and in year 4 the amount exempt would be twenty thousand dollars $2000000 after the expiration of the incentive period the business would be taxed on the full amount of both the additional assessed value of real estate and the new gross receipts  2712 performance agreement a each performance agreement shall include a requirement throughout the incentive period that the

in this article a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections 2572e and f b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subparagraphs 2572d1a 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subparagraph d1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs d1a of this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the superintendent a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 2577 the industrial user must also be in compliance with section 251008 regarding the prohibition of bypass e the superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the superintendent when converting such limits to concentration limits the superintendent will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by section 2577 in addition the superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available f once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived g many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation h any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the superintendent within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate  10212 modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards where the potw achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards the potw may apply to the approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninetyfive 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 4037c2 of title 40 of the federal regulations general pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution promulgated pursuant to the act the potw may

fails b prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 2571 or the specific prohibitions in subsections 2571a s if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 3 the affirmative defenses outlined under prohibited discharges do not apply to the specific prohibitions in

enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user

unacceptable increases in flood heights velocities and frequencies 2 restricting or prohibiting certain uses activities and development from locating within areas subject to flooding 3 requiring all those uses activities and developments that do occur in floodprone areas to be protected andor floodproofed against flooding and flood damage 4 protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards b basis of districts 1 the various floodplain districts shall include areas subject to inundation by waters of the one hundredyear flood the basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study for prince william county virginia and incorporated areas including the city of manassas park prepared by the

floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one hundredyear flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one 1 foot at any point these areas included in this district are specifically defined in table no 9 of the above referenced flood insurance study and shown on the accompanying flood boundary and floodway map or flood insurance rate map 3 the

buffering a intent the intent of this section is to harmonize uses and structures in close proximity to each other which otherwise would be regarded as incompatible and to generally establish a pleasing and attractive environment in the city more specifically this section is intended to make incompatible uses compatible by requiring a buffer or screen between incompatible uses in order to minimize the harmful impacts of noise dust and other debris motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusion and other objectionable activities conducted on or created by an adjoining or nearby use 1 a landscape plan prepared by a certified landscape architect which includes buffer areas basic landscaping and screening shall be provided for all development plans where required by the zoning ordinance b buffer zone required buffer areas between adjoining incompatible land uses are required in all zoning districts to reduce or eliminate the incompatibility and to promote
