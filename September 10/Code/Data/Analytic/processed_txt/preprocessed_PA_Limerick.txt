runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines the identified floodplain areas management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety amended 3152016 by  b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers identified floodplain areas
