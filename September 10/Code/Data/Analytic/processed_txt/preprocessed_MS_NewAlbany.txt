the following 3000201 a title sheet indicating the project name and a vicinity map clearly showing the location and construction limits of the project the title sheet should also bear the signature and stamp of the registered professional engineer in charge of the design and plan preparation for the project all plans unless otherwise allowed by the city engineer should be prepared and stamped by a registered professional engineer in the state of mississippi 3000202 a typical section sheet showing the proposed street cross section details on base and pavement materials and thickness should be clearly shown in projects where an existing street is being reconstructed or overlaid an existing cross section should also be shown 3000203 plan and profile sheets depicting the projects horizontal and vertical alignments and the design details of the same details regarding drainage facilities rightsofway easements and adjacent property owners affected should be clearly shown 3000204 additional sheets as necessary to convey details of traffic control and safety measures erosion control and mitigation procedures 30003 plans not meeting these minimum standards may be rejected all plans should be submitted well before construction is scheduled to begin so that city personnel or the cities representative has time to review the drawings and issue the applicable permits 30004 all work that is to be dedicated to the city of new albany as public infrastructure shall be inspected by a representative from the city or a letter of certification shall be provided to the city from the engineer of record to ensure compliance with the approved plans and specifications work that is not inspected by city personnel cities representative or certified to by the engineer of record will be rejected applicable permits that are obtained and copies of the plans and specifications for the project should be kept on site during construction at all times prior to acceptance of any portion of the work ie subgrade base pavement city personnel or the cities representative shall inspect the work for material quality course thickness and workmanship any portion of the work or materials found to be unacceptable shall be removed and replaced 301  street classifications 30101 for purposes of identifying a street or highways intended or actual use three separate street classifications have been developed these classifications generally adhere to nationally accepted standards but are defined here for clarity 3010101 arterials  arterials may be classified as either principal or minor but for purposes of this manual and within the context of the city of new albany no such separate distinction will be made arterials are defined as corridors generating the highest traffic volumes with the longest trip desires and are commonly referred to as major thoroughfares the arterial system generally will consist of multiple lanes of traffic will serve the major centers of activity and will be the primary routes entering and leaving the urban area as well as providing routes for intraarea travel such as between business districts and outlying residential areas for design considerations of this manual all arterials within the city of new albany will be assumed to carry 5% heavy truck traffic 3010102 collectors  the collector system provides land service access and traffic circulation within business districts residential neighborhoods and industrial areas a collector gathers traffic from within specific land use zones and distributes it to the arterial system collectors within the city of new albany function as primary routes between land use zones and tie directly into the arterial system they will carry high volumes of traffic both commercial and residential traffic carter avenue central avenue hillcrest dr glendale dr and main street are examples of collectors within the city of new albany for design purposes collectors within the city of new albany will be anticipated to carry 2% heavy truck traffic unless the designer is directed to accommodate a higher or lower percentage by the city heavy truck traffic will be considered negligible on collector streets with an adt < 2000 unless special consideration is ordered by the city minimum design criteria for collector streets are show on appendix 8  figure 1a 3010103 local streets  local streets comprise of all facilities that cannot be categorized into one of the other two classifications these include mainly residential streets within distinct neighborhoods and subdivisions they function to distribute traffic to the collector system and beyond and will often carry very low traffic volumes adt < 400 except for industrial districts local streets will be assumed to carry no truck traffic in newly developed subdivisions local streets shall be designed so that blocks do not exceed 1500 feet in length in the agricultureopen space zone 1000 feet in the lowdensity residential zone or 750 feet in other residential zones unless severe topographic constraints or other unusual features make an excessive length necessary connections between streets shall be created in such a way that they do not encourage the use of such streets by substantial a local street open at only one end should have a culdesac turn around at the closed end such dead end streets should be kept to minimum length as possible and in no instance should a dead end street exceed 500 feet in length minimum design criteria for local streets are show on appendix 8  figure 1b minimum design criteria for culdesacs are shown on appendix 8  figure 1e 3010104 alleys  alleys are small low volume streets that provide access to the side or rear of individual parcels of land in medium to high density residential and commercial areas they are categorized separately from local streets in that they are intended in many cases to serve only a few individual parcels in commercial districts they may be used primarily for loading and unloading of goods and other materials in residential districts they may serve as few as two or three separate homes and provide a safer alternative to on street parking on the primary local and collector routes traditional housing developments with alleys will be allowed they should be aligned parallel or perpendicular to adjoining street property lines and it is desirable to situate them where they connect to a local street or collector on both ends dead end alleys may be permissible in certain situations and where allowed should be equipped with a turnaround if their length exceeds 600 feet minimum design criteria for turnarounds are shown on figure 1e because of their intended use the geometric criteria for their design will be somewhat less intrusive than that of a local street and is illustrated in appendix 8  figure 1d 302  general street design criteria 30201 horizontal and vertical alignment 3020101 horizontal and vertical alignments for all streets shall be designed in accordance with the following resources 30201011 a policy on geometric design of highways and streets 2001 ed association of state highway and transportation officials aashto

streets and arterials no more than two 2 streets shall intersect at any one point unless the city certifies to the permit issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety turning lanes shall be provided at heavily traveled intersections as determined by the city care should be taken by the designer to provide the maximum amount of sight distance possible at all intersections all traffic stripe shall contain reflectorized beads at the rate specified in the mississippi standard specifications for road and bridge construction 2004 edition 3020104 in cases where existing streets which are slated to be reconstructed or widened do not meet the above recommended design criteria every effort should be made to during the design process to make the necessary adjustments to bring the street within these parameters in instances where this is not feasible due to physical restraints or rightofway restrictions the designer shall notify the city in writing and request a design exception for the project 30202 base and pavingdesign criteria and construction requirements 3020201 if the design engineer chooses to use structure

oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market 2 neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in reports made available to the board of aldermen the board of aldermen finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug use exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 8 according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 9 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 10 numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids including semen and urine are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 11 nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution increases sexual assaults and attracts other criminal activity 12 nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drugdealing and drug use 13 the findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1 12 raise substantial governmental concerns and requires immediate attention to protect the public health and safety 14 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 15 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licenses is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 16 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 17 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 18 it is desirable in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 19 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter 20 the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five 5 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 21 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by
