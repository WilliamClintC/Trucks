obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the

hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 16203 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in 1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as
