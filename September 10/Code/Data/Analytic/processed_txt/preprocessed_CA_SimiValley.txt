now constituted or as they may hereafter be amended or recodified  1 eff  6  objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works potw that will interfere with its operation  b to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw that will pass potw inadequately treated into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the potw  c to protect both potw personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the public  d to promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the potw  e to provide for equitable distribution of the total cost of the citys sewerage system and all related programs establishment of fair and equitable fees charges and penalties  f to regulate direct and indirect users of the citys sewerage system issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and of general requirements for all other users  g to provide for monitoring and enforcement activities  and h to enable the city to comply with its national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit sludge andor biosolids use and disposal requirements and any other federal state or local laws to which the potw is subject  1 eff  6  policy the city protects the health welfare and safety of the local residents city employees and the environment by constructing operating and maintaining a system of local sewers trunk sewers and interceptors and liquid waste treatment and disposal facilities that service the homes industries and commercial establishments throughout the city and surrounding environments as required by federal state and local law the following basic policies apply to sanitary sewage liquid waste and industrial and process wastewater discharged into the sewerage system and disposal works of the city a the highest priority and best use of the sewerage system is the collection treatment and reclamation or disposal of sanitary sewage the use of the sewerage system for industrial and process wastewater discharges is subject to regulation by the city b in accordance with the policies and goals of the pollution prevention act of 1990 42 usc 13101 et seq and the hazardous waste source reduction and management review act of 1989 california health and safety 12 et seq industry is urged to seek source reduction waste minimization pollution prevention andor recovery and reuse procedures to meet the limitations set on industrial and process wastewater discharges rather than those procedures designed solely to meet discharge limitations c the city is committed to a policy of wastewater reclamation and reuse in order to provide an alternate source of water supply and to reduce overall costs of wastewater treatment and disposal the reclamation of wastewater treatment processes may necessitate more stringent quality requirements on industrial and process wastewater discharges as the demand for reclaimed water increases optimum use of city facilities may require the discharge of wastewaters during periods of low flow in the sewerage system as established by the city d provisions are made in this chapter to regulate industrial and process wastewater discharges to comply with federal and state government requirements and policies and to meet increasingly higher standards of treatment plant effluent quality and environmental considerations this chapter establishes quantity and quality limitations on sanitary sewage liquid waste and industrial and process wastewater discharges where such discharges may adversely affect the sewerage system or the effluent quality it is the intent of these limitations to improve the quality of wastewater being received for treatment and to encourage water conservation by all users connected to a public sewer it is the citys policy to discourage an increase in the quantity or mass emission of waste pollutants being discharged this chapter also provides for regulation of the degree of wastewater pretreatment required the issuance of permits for industrial and process wastewater discharge connections and other miscellaneous permits and the establishment of penalties for violations of the chapter e cost recovery methods are established where industrial and process wastewater discharges impose collection system treatment or disposal costs on the city which are unfair andor inequitable to all users of the system  1 eff  6  availability of sewerage facilities if sewerage capacity is not available the director may restrict discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available when requested the director may advise industrial wastewater users desiring to locate new facilities as to the areas where wastewater of their quantity and

article and having weighed the costs and benefits of these regulations the city council finds and declares that 1 the uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in the public rightofway can constitute a threat to public health safety and welfare by interfering with and obstructing the use of the public rightofway and by offending community aesthetic sensibilities 2 newsracks located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rightsofway and unsightly dirty or otherwise inadequately maintained newsracks located therein constitute public nuisances 3 the uncontrolled proliferation of newsracks creates visual clutter and detracts from the appearance of streets sidewalks and adjacent businesses 4 the foregoing conditions are illustrated by the photos contained in exhibit a attached to the ordinance codified in this article and constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rightsofway constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy are injurious to health offensive to the senses and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community 5 the council recognizes however that the use of such rightsofway is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied the council further finds that these strong and competing interests of providing for newsracks as a means to distribute information that is accessible to the public and in a manner that is sensitive to the aesthetic attributes and pedestrian circulation require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved means of this article which is designated to accommodate such interests by regulating the time place and manner of using such newsracks 6 the color height and size restrictions and limitations on the number of newsracks at any one location or on a block directly advance the citys substantial interests in curbing visual blight because newsracks that are smaller and shorter and more uniform in color are less apt to offend community aesthetic sensibilities also fewer newsracks at any one location or on a block will advance the citys interest in eliminating visual clutter as well as advancing pedestrian and vehicular safety these restrictions are not based on content or viewpoint a city may fairly prefer smaller or fewer objects of visual blight over larger ones or more of them at any one location by not banning all newsracks a significant opportunity to communicate by other means is permitted which generally constitutes a first amendment virtue rather than a vice see prime media inc v city of brentwood tennessee 398 f3d 814 6th cir 2005 7 in addition as required by the tests used by the courts for time place and manner restrictions such as contained in the ordinance codified in this article these regulations leave ample alternative channels of communications in that although the number of newsracks in any one location or on any block are limited there are a vast number of blocks and locations available in the citys thirtyeight and nine tenths square miles at which newsracks are permitted to be located under the are more than sufficient to accommodate the approximately two hundred fifty 250 to three hundred 300 newsracks currently in the city that are located in the public rightofway 8 in creating these restrictions the city council has considered their costs and benefits and drafted these regulations so that they are not substantially broader than necessary to protect the citys interests in eliminating visual clutter improving the communities aesthetics and advancing public safety see get outdoors ii v city of san diego 506 f3d 886 9th cir 2007 and prime media inc supra cited with approval by the 9th circuit in get outdoors ii b purpose the purpose of this article is to achieve the legally required reasonable fit between the city councils goal of promoting the citys substantial governmental interests in aesthetics and safety and the regulation of the placement appearance number size and servicing of newsracks on the public rightsofway so as to 1 provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience including the elimination of damage to persons and property from nonanchored newsracks caused by strong wind conditions other acts of nature or vandalism  2 ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into or egress from any place of business or residence from the street to the sidewalk or from parked vehicles to the sidewalk  3 provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks poles posts traffic signs and signals hydrants and mailboxes and similar appurtenances and access to locations used for public transportation purposes  4 relocate andor replace newsracks which result in a visual blight and clutter associated with poorly maintained or improperly located or abandoned newsracks and unnecessarily large groupings of newsracks on the public rightsofway  5 protect the aesthetic character of the city and value of surrounding properties  6 protect the quiet of residential areas  7 encourage welldesigned and aesthetically compatible newsracks  8 reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation including the elimination of damage to persons and property from nonanchored newsracks caused by strong wind conditions other acts of nature or vandalism  9 protect the right to distribute information protected by the united states and california constitutions use

hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  1 exh a eff  7  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of simi valley city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses  1 exh a eff  7  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public monies for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by requiring that due regard be given to flood risk factors in floodplain development in order to minimize future flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  1 exh a eff  7  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling fill grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  1 exh a eff  definitions 7  scope for the purposes of this chapter only words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted in order to give them the

exceeding allowable stresses water loads are loads or pressures on surfaces of structures caused and induced by the presence of flood waters they are hydrostatic hydrodynamic or impact loads  1 exh a eff  7  hydrostatic loads a hydrostatic loads are those caused by water above or below surface free or confined which is either stagnant or moves at low velocities less than five 5 feet per second the pressure at any point is equal to the unit weight of water 624 pounds per cubic foot multiplied by the height of water above the point to which confined water would rise if free to do so hydrostatic loads consist of vertical loads lateral loads and uplift 1 vertical loads these are loads acting vertically downward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of buildings or structures such as roofs decks or floors and walls caused by the weight of flood waters above them 2 lateral loads lateral hydrostatic loads are those which act in a horizontal direction against vertical or inclined surfaces both above and below the ground surface and tend to cause lateral displacement overturning of the building structure or parts thereof 3 uplift uplift loads are those which act in a vertically upward direction on the underside of horizontal or sloping surfaces of buildings or structures such as basement slabs footings floors decks roofs and overhangs hydrostatic loads acting on inclined rounded or irregular surfaces may be resolved into vertical or uplift loads and lateral loads based on the geometry of the surfaces and the distribution of hydrostatic pressures  1 exh a eff  7  hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads the purpose of these regulations are those induced on structures the flow of flood water moving at moderate to high velocity around the structures or parts thereof above ground level such loads may occur below the ground level when openings or conduits exist which allow free flow of flood waters hydrodynamic loads are basically of the lateral type and relate to direct impact loads by the moving mass of water and to drag forces as the water flows around the obstruction conversion to equivalent hydrostatic loads for the purpose of these regulations and for cases when water velocities do not exceed ten 10 feet per second dynamic effects of the moving water may be converted into equivalent hydrostatic loads by increasing the depth of water by an amount dh on the upstream side and above the ground level only equal to v is the average velocity of the water in feet per second  g is the acceleration of gravity 322 feet per second per second  and a is the coefficient of drag or shape factor the value of a unless otherwise evaluated shall not be less than 125 the equivalent surcharge depth dh shall be added to the depth measured between the design level and the regulatory flood and the resultant pressures applied to and uniformly distributed across the vertical projected area of the building or structure which is perpendicular to the flow surfaces parallel to the flow or surfaces facing downstream shall be considered subject to hydrostatic pressures for depths to the regulatory flood only  1 exh a eff  7  impact loads a types for the purposes of these regulations impact loads are those which result from floating debris and floatable objects or masses carried by flood waters striking against structures or parts thereof these loads are of two 2 basic types normal and special 1 normal impact loads normal impact loads are those which relate to isolated occurrences of logs or floatable objects of normally encountered sizes striking buildings or parts thereof 2 special impact loads special impact loads are those which relate to large conglomerates of floatable objects such as an accumulation of floating debris either striking or resting against a building or parts thereof b applicability impact loads shall be considered in the design of structures and parts thereof as stipulated below 1 normal impact loads a concentrated load acting horizontally at the regulatory flood level or at any point below it equal to the impact force produced by a 1000 pound mass traveling at the velocity of the flood water and acting on a one square foot surface of the structure i deceleration of the mass shall occur over 05 seconds  ii this load shall be applied to the structure in such a manner that stresses are maximized 2 special impact loads special impact loads shall be considered in the design of buildings structures or parts thereof unless a rational and detailed analysis is made and submitted for approval by the director of public works the intensity of load shall be taken as 100 pounds per foot acting horizontally over a one foot wide horizontal strip at the regulatory flood level or at any level below it where natural or artificial barriers exist which would effectively prevent these special impact loads from occurring the loads may be ignored in the design  1 exh a eff  7  pressure equalization all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclose areas below the lowest floor and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria a minimum of two 2 openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one 1 foot above grade openings may be equipped with screens louvers valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters see e5 pressure equalization shall be appropriate for unfinished or floodresistant enclosures either unused or solely used for parking of vehicles building access or storage in areas other than basements all other structures shall be elevated or floodproofed pursuant to the terms of this chapter  1 exh a eff  variance procedures 7  conditions for variances a variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure b variances shall not be issued within any regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result c variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the floodplain administrator believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter d variances shall only be issued upon all of the following 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause which does not include economic considerations aesthetics or past practices  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause a fraud upon the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the planning commission acting as the variance board may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  1 exh a eff  7  nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are intended to be quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in

established by this intended to appropriately regulate the placement type size and number of signs allowed within the city and to require the proper maintenance of signs in order to protect the public health safety and welfare in order to further these purposes the city finds and determines that these regulations are necessary in order to a avoid traffic hazards to motorists and pedestrians caused by visual distractions and obstructions by insuring that official traffic regulation devices can be easily seen that adequate sight distance is maintained and that visual impacts are limited to reduce hazards by prohibiting nearby visual obstructions such as moving rotating or blinking signs an excessive number of signs an excessive amount of copyon signs or signs resembling official signs and by prohibiting signs in the public rightofway  b promote the aesthetic and environmental values of the community by providing for signs that do not impair the attractiveness of the city prohibiting the visual clutter of obtrusive signs and prohibiting signs in the public rightofway  c provide for signs as an effective channel of communications while ensuring that signs are aesthetically proportioned in relation to adjacent structures and the structures to which they are attached  d regulate commercial signage based upon the citys determination that such signage constitutes the majority of existing signs and that the city desires to regulate and allow such signage in such a manner that allows for reasonable and equitable identification of businesses and properties while providing a channel of communication to advertise businesses in the commercial and industrial zones of the city and maintaining the residential character of the citys residential zones  e regulate based upon the citys compelling interest in maintaining the residential character of such zones in order to provide that a residential use with a home occupation shall be considered a residential use and no commercial signs other than commercial signs placed by charitable organizations may be displayed  f regulate based upon the citys compelling interest in ensuring traffic safety in order to provide that ancillary signs are permitted in order to directly advance that interest subject to the maximum number set forth in this development   and g prohibit the placement of signs in the public rightofway based upon the following prior to the adoption of the ordinance the city of simi valley has permitted temporary signs in the public rightofway which has resulted in substantial unsightly conditions as illustrated in evidence presented to the city council during its consideration of this ordinance the placement and accumulation of temporary signs in the public rightofway on traffic and utility devices upon public sidewalks or on public easements presents dangerous conditions to the free and safe flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic such areas must be preserved for official traffic signs and official utility notices in order to assure the safe flow of traffic in addition in upholding prohibitions against the posting of signs on sidewalks utility poles and other public property the us supreme court in the case city council of los angeles v taxpayers for vincent 466 us 789 1984  said that the problem addressed by this ordinance  the visual assault on the citizens of los angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public property  constitutes a significant substantive evil within the citys power to prohibit the citys interest in attempting to preserve or improve the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect young v american mini theaters inc 427 us at 71  the vincent court also observed that temporary signs could still be allowed on private property noting that moreover by not extending the ban to all locations a significant opportunity to communicate by means of temporary signs is preserved and private property owners esthetic concerns will keep the posting of signs on their property within reasonable bounds even if some visual blight remains a partial contentneutral ban may nevertheless enhance the citys appearance h regulate signs for charitable organizations by permitting them to be located on private property and for a sufficient duration in order to promote charitable events and activities based upon the citys substantial interest in supporting such events and activities because of the community services they support and based upon the following the temporary sign ordinance which prohibits signs on public property and in the public rightofway and otherwise limits the number and duration of temporary commercial signs on private property directly advances the citys substantial governmental interests and concerns regarding aesthetics by reducing the visual blight created by the proliferation of temporary commercial signs without burdening an excessive amount of speech the sign ordinance is narrowly tailored because it does not overregulate protected speech it restricts the duration size and location of temporary commercial signs other than signs placed by charitable organizations also with the limited exception of charitable commercial signs the ordinance prohibits commercial signs in residential zones in order to advance the citys compelling interest in maintaining the residential character of such zones commercial enterprises still have the ability to advertise contact and communicate with consumers in other ways  such as direct mail newspaper radio television and onsite advertising the general principle that the first amendment forbids the government from regulating speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others is not applicable here because the citys regulations are neutral or even silent concerning any speakers point of view members of the city council of the city of los angeles v taxpayers for vincent 1984 466 us 787 contentbased regulations which disadvantage commercial speech are subject to a lesser degree of first amendment protection as provided in the us supreme court case central hudson gas & electric corp v public service commission of ny 447 us 557 566 1980 central hudson established a threepart test for first amendment challenges to regulations restricting nonmisleading commercial speech that relates to lawful activity first the government must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by the regulation second the regulation must directly advance that governmental interest third although the regulation need not be the least restrictive measure available it must be narrowly tailored so as not to restrict more speech than necessary together these final two factors require that there be a reasonable fit between the governments objectives and the means it chooses to accomplish those ends the government bears the burden of asserting one or more substantial governmental interests and demonstrating a reasonable fit between those interests and the challenged regulation the government is not limited in the evidence it may use to meet its burden unlike the ban in city of cincinnati v discovery network inc 507 us 410 1993 which only applied to 62 of the 1500 to 2000 news racks in the city addressing only a minute and paltry share of the problem the city of simi valleys limitation of allowing one temporary onsite commercial sign by permit for four 30 day periods per year applies to all of the approximately 7500 businesses in simi valley which have obtained business licenses and will substantially reduce the number of temporary commercial signs from what has previously been allowed in the city charitable signs without such numerical or permit requirements may also be placed on private property with permission of the property owner however based upon historical experience in the city the number of charitable organizations and events and thus the potential for placement of their signs are limited in number moreover eliminating commercial signs from residential neighborhoods except for charitable commercial signs will substantially advance the citys interests in aesthetics and maintaining the residential character of residential neighborhoods in addition the city is going no further than necessary to achieve its regulatory objective in that the distinctions between commercial signs has been structured to be based upon broad categories ie signs placed by charitable organizations promoting charitable events and activities as opposed to the specific content or point of view of the organization or enterprise the government may be said to advance its purpose by substantially reducing sign proliferation even where it is not totally eradicated evidence presented to the city council during its consideration of the adoption of this ordinance provided examples of sign proliferation in the city a limitation on temporary sign display is directly related to the objective of aesthetics the simi valley city council desires to allow a greater number of temporary charitable commercial signs because of their unique value to the community the city has a substantial governmental interest in permitting nonprofit organizations that are raising funds for charitable events that support social services in the community to have their signs in place for an amount of time sufficient to promote their event this is necessary because most of these charitable organizations unlike most commercial businesses have no fixed location where they can place signs upon their property advertising their events thus furthering the necessity for signage display the temporary sign ordinance does not hinder any businesss ability to advertise its business by other means such as additional window signs newspaper direct mail or other forms of advertising in addition to permitted onsite temporary signs there is a distinction drawn in the ordinance between the signs of sellers of goods or services and those placed by charitable organizations the united states supreme court held that because charitable solicitation does more than inform private economic decisions and is not primarily concerned with providing information about the characteristics and costs of goods and services it has not been dealt with as a variety of purely commercial speech village of schaumburg v citizens for a better environment 444 us 620 632 1980  see also mainstream marketing services v federal trade commission 10th circuit 2004  therefore the city of simi valley has established a reasonable fit between the substantial interests which it advances and the regulation of the signs  4 eff  9  applicability a signs regulated the requirements and
