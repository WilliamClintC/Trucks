zoning ordinance  2001 74 fffw flood plain districts overlay district  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 1943 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area therefore the city council of the city of lavista nebraska ordains as follows  findings of fact 01 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city of la vista nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 02 general causes of flood losses flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 03 methods used to analyze flood hazards these regulations use a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for these regulations is representative of large floods which are reasonable characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to these regulations it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated in the official flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  and as may be amended 2 calculations of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood la vista nebraska  zoning ordinance  2001 75  statement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in by applying the provisions of these regulations for the following purposes 01 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 02 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of
