volumes and traffic operations generated by platting replatting rezoning a change in use or new development will not prevent the city from implementing its then planned street system improvements 2 traffic volumes and traffic operations generated by platting replatting rezoning a change in use or new development will not negatively impact a communitys existing street system and traffic operations or create safety hazards 3 new plats land that is rezoned or replatted a change in use and new development will be served and supported by an adequate network of streets and thoroughfares necessary and desirable public rightsofway for offsite abutting and internal thoroughfares will be provided to support new development at the time of platting rezoning replatting or development of the land 4 driveway accessibility nor onsite circulation plans for a change in use or new development will not significantly impact or create safety of traffic operations on adjacent public streets or prevent the safe and convenient circulation of onsite traffic operations 5 parking demand generated by platting rezoning replatting a change in use or new development will be adequately addressed onsite or in offstreet satellite parking facilities 6 opportunities to reduce travel demand andor efficiently manage travel demand will be investigated and implemented definitions change in use a change of use is a use which may create traffic patterns that substantially differ from traffic patterns of the existing approved use of a building or land based upon a consideration of the following a modifications to existing improvements or construction of new improvements b the hours days or seasons during which a use operates c the number of employees or staff occupants visitors or other persons using the land building or structures city of anoka city code chapter 74  article ix  division 5  of 7 d the number of employees or staff occupants visitors or other persons using the land building or structures e the amount andor nature of traffic parking shipping or deliveries associated with the use on the premises daily trip or trips per day the number of trips a particular land use will generate within a 24 hour period intersection level of service los a measure of delay vehicles will experience at intersections peak hour trips the number of trips typically between 7 am and 9 am am peak and between 4 pm and 6 pm pm peak monday or as may be specifically attributable to the building or land based upon its particular use roadway los a measure of the volume of traffic a roadway

nobuild conditions and forecast build conditions items to address in traffic analysis based upon a review of the tia or tis and other applicant supplied data the planning commission and city council will determine if the proposed rezoning platting replatting change of use or new development plans meets the following a the plans are consistent with the citys then existing planned improvements and will not prevent the city from moving forward with its plans b the plans will not create safety hazards c the plans provide for adequate accessibility between the development and the street system and an adequate onsite circulation system d the plans provide for adequate onsite parking or satellite parking as determined by applicable city e the plans include reasonable approaches to reduce andor manage travel demand traffic impact assessment tia a traffic impact assessment is required if a rezoning replatting or change of use generates between 50 and 99 peak hour trips per peak direction
