citizens the individual wellbeing of its residents and the commercial and industrial vitality of an area indirectly depends upon the availability of a useable water supply blikewise the wastewater treatment system is designed to treat and dispose sewage in a safe and sanitary means when the treatment and disposal is conducted properly the contamination of the groundwater supply and the threat of health hazards in populated areas is minimized cthe city is dedicated to the premise that the water and sewer systems have been paid for substantially by the citizens of the city and therefore

same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenient travel in public spaces free from intimidating conduct threats and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation that may occur at particular settings and contexts  2council finds that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive including vocal requests for a donation  carrying or displaying a sign requesting donations  shaking or jingling a cup of change  and ringing a bell in compliance with any applicable noise ordinance  3however council finds that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city which threatens the security privacy and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors  and 4council also finds that the presence of solicitors in certain specific areas such as but not limited to near to adjacent to automatic teller machines adjacent to sidewalk cafes and in public parking areas create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy freedom of movement and personal security  and 5council further finds that certain solicitation impedes the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic that leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety particularly in congested roadways and sidewalks to include highly traveled areas or small traffic medians 6this chapter is not intended to impermissibly limit an individuals right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation  rather it aims to impose specific time place and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances  namely aggressive panhandling panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous andor panhandling in places where people are a captive audience and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations  and 7in promulgating this chapter council seeks to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant government interests bthe purpose of this section is to regulate certain behavior to preserve the public order to protect the citizens of whiteville and to ensure the safe and uninterrupted passage of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unconstitutionally impinging upon protected speech expression or conduct

businesses in order to protect public health safety and welfare of citizens and visitors and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this subchapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this subchapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material brationale the following regulations were designed to address two very distinct issues 1one the city wants to minimize the potential secondary impacts of sexually oriented businesses on those identified sensitive uses ie residential districts schools churches day care centers and the like 2two the city wants to provide an area where people can exercise their first amendment right to expression without infringing on other peoples rights in allowing these uses the city has had to balance its constitutional obligations with the need to guarantee the local economy and quality of life is not impacted cfindings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community and on findings incorporated in the cases city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theaters us 50 1976 and barnes v glenn theater inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  tucson arizona  saint paul minnesota  houston texas  austin texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota and a report on the regulation of adult establishments in north carolina  the city finds the following 1according to the studies referenced above sexually oriented businesses tend to lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further without reasonable regulations there is no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2employees of certain sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other commercial establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at certain sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult cabarets and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7since 1951 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv in the united states and in the state 8the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 68953 reported in the united states in 1996 9the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with 392848 cases being reported in 1995 10according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 11sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 12numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 13numerous studies and reports have demonstrated that the consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages at a sexually oriented business increases the potential for illicit sexual activity violence acts characterized as disturbing the peace and other identified nuisances to occur 14studies have demonstrated that sexually oriented businesses are regional businesses and as such have a regional draw 15small towns do not have sufficient target populations to support sexually oriented businesses as has been documented in numerous trade area studies 16studies have demonstrated that a sexually oriented business in a small town will draw in a regional population consisting largely of adult males in their twenties whose interests and activities are different from those of the older adults or families 17the findings noted in divisions c1 c16 above raise substantial governmental concerns 18sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns 19a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens and visitors of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 20requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help to reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this subchapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of federal and state law and this subchapter 24the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25by establishing locational criteria to keep sexually oriented businesses away from sensitive uses such as residential districts schools day care centers and the like the potential for the identified secondary harms to be felt by a sensitive use is lowered 26by establishing additional lighting requirements for the interior and exterior portions of a sexually oriented business the potential for illicit sexual activity or criminal activities occurring on or near the premises of a sexually oriented business is lowered 27by establishing a prohibition on employing or allowing within the premises minors the potential for the exploitation of such minors by a sexually oriented business is lowered 28by requiring internal design configuration standards and the location of managers stations to allow the operators to observe and police their own patrons the potential for illicit sexual activity or criminal activities occurring at a sexually oriented business is lowered 29the general welfare health and safety of the citizens and visitors of the city will be promoted by the enactment of these regulations  11601   definitions for the purpose of this subchapter the

nonconforming use may not be increased except that a larger singlefamily residential structure may be constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger manufactured home intended for residential use may replace a smaller one  2the reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements height limitations or density requirements and the dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of the building  and 3the reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were previously unenclosed even though those areas were used in connection with the nonconforming activity an area is unenclosed unless at least 75% or more of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence iexcept for singlefamily residential structures including manufactured homes if

discontinuance of nonconforming situations awhen a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes except as provided in division b below bthe board of adjustment may issue a use permit to allow a nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 180 consecutive days to be reinstated if it finds that the nonconforming use has been discontinued for less than one year and the discontinuance resulted from factors that for all practical purposes were beyond the control of the person maintaining the nonconforming use cif the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located unless the board of adjustment issues a permit to allow the property to be used for a conforming purpose without correcting the nonconforming situation the board shall issue a permit if it finds that the nonconforming situation cannot be corrected without undue hardship or expense and the nonconforming situation is of a minor nature that does not adversely affect the surrounding property or the general public to any significant extent dfor purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter and so if a manufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located removal of that manufactured home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it ewhen a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter the 180day period for purposes of this section begins to run at the effective date of this

nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date thereafter work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a permit issued by the board of adjustment except as provided in division b below the board shall issue a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his or her project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the board shall be guided by the following 1all expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building or zoning permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective  2except as provided in division a1 above no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this chapter shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure  3to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property  4an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the developer  5a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him or her  and 6even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the board may still find that he or she acted in good faith if he or she did not proceed with his or her plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the board may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development  and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures bthe requirements of division a above shall not apply to a nonconforming project if the building inspector certifies that actual construction of that project began at least 180 days before the effective date of this chapter and that the work is at least 75% complete at the effective date of this chapter cthe board of adjustment shall not consider any application for a permit authorized by division a above that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this chapter unless is waives this requirement for good cause shown dif the board of adjustment issues a permit pursuant to division a above it may attach the reasonable conditions to the permit as it finds necessary to reduce the extent to which the nonconforming project is incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood in particular the board may require that work on the nonconforming project be continuously maintained if possible and that the project be completed as expeditiously as possible ethe building inspector shall send copies of this section to the owners and developers if different from the owners of all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be under construction this notice shall be sent by registered mail not less than 15 days before the effective date of this chapter fthe board of adjustment shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section these applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of this chapter so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted gwhen it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that the nonconforming project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in stages segments or other discreet units the board of adjustment shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary
