wetlands that are within a designated illinois natural areas inventory site inai m appendix m  smc approved wetland mitigation banking requirements 1 purpose this subsection m includes the criteria for establishing owning and operating wetland mitigation banks it further sets out the criteria for authorizing applicants eg individuals corporations units of government to withdraw credits from a mitigation bank to offset unavoidable wetland impacts that would result from the applicants proposed activity 2 goals mitigation banks are a form of regional mitigation which encourage the development of large scale wetland complexes that can be professionally managed and maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of the general public the consolidation of multiple small mitigation projects allows for economies of scale in planning implementation and maintenance and can produce wetlands of greater value because of their size and a high level of commitment to long term management the expected benefits include water quality management wildlife habitat restoration and creation flood control conservation of biological diversity education recreation and aesthetics further this action will reduce administrative costs and delays in issuing permits for proposed activities that qualify for use of a mitigation bank mitigation banking is intended to be a means of creating or restoring wetlands and generating bank credits in advance of the filling of wetlands for specific projects as an interim measure and as a way to encourage the initial development and implementation of banks the sale of bank credits and the issuance of permits prior to the generation of bank credits at the bank site shall be allowed under conditions described elsewhere in this document 3 definitions creation conversion of a nonwetland site into a wetland site by excavation diking and flooding or conversion of a deep water site by filling credit certification a formal determination by the smc that mitigation bank credits have been generated certified credits result from fully meeting all certification standards see subsection m15 credit certification of this section conditionally certified credits are those credits that are based on reasonable progress toward becoming certified credits uncertified credits are those credits that are based on full approval of the bank charter and initial construction of the bank including demonstration of wetland hydrology and planting a maximum of thirty percent 30% of the total potential credits may be sold upon approval of bank charter alone an additional twenty percent 20% of the total credits may be sold upon the demonstration of wetland hydrology upon completion of the approved planting plan an additional twenty percent 20% of the total credits may be sold using this formula seventy percent 70% of the total credits available from the bank may be sold as uncertified credits designated service area the designated service area of an smc approved mitigation bank is lake county or that portion of the village of barrington within cook county enhancement altering the physical characteristics of an existing wetland such that it permanently improves one or more specific wetland functions and values because impacts associated with individual projects that propose to use bank credits will in virtually all cases be permanent only enhancement that results in permanent improvement of a wetlands functions and values will generate credits growing season the period between may 1 and october 10 this growing season definition is for the purposes of this subsection m alone and is used to establish performance periods for determining compliance with revegetation standards it does not establish the growing season for purposes of wetland delineation ledger document to be used in the accounting of credits and debits the ledger will be maintained by the bank sponsor and reviewed by the smc management actions taken within mitigation bank wetlands to establish and maintain desired habitat conditions representative management actions include water level manipulations herbiciding mechanical plant removal and prescribed burning mitigation bank a system of accounting for wetland loss and compensation which can include one or more wetland mitigation sites the minimum acreage requirements in this chapter shall apply to each site  sterling codifiers inc  479522 mitigation bank charter a written document which contains specifications pertaining to establishment operation and maintenance of a wetland mitigation bank codification of the goals objectives procedures of the bank and incorporating the relevant terms and conditions of this chapter principal types of banking charters are a legally binding agreement or a

functions and values for the purposes of compensating for wetland impacts the replacement of the wetland functions and values is generally accomplished restoration creation and enhancement 4 reserved 5 considerations in establishment and use of mitigation banks charters of mitigation banks mitigation sites and associated wetland credits shall be subject to approval by the smc every mitigation bank shall have as its primary purpose the creation restoration enhancement and long term protection and maintenance of wetland resources all existing property rights remain in effect in all cases of a proposed bank the smc will issue a public notice describing the project the public comment period for submittal of relevant comments on the bank prospectus will be a minimum of thirty 30 days the watershed development permit that is needed in order to construct restore or enhance wetlands on the bank site will follow normal permit processing procedures operation and maintenance procedures approved by the smc shall be employed to maintain the wetland resources in the bank in as high a qualitative state as is technically practicable management of the mitigation bank shall be based on a monitoring plan approved by the smc monitoring shall include but shall not necessarily be limited to monitoring of the water soil and plants comprising the wetland assets of the bank the bank sponsor shall strive to manage the assets to provide multiple wetland benefits such as water quality management flood control biological conservation and educational and recreational opportunities in general mitigation banks should be planned and designed such that little or no management or maintenance other than prescribed burning is necessary once the plant communities are established 6 general guidelines using normal review procedures prescribed by this chapter the smc will conduct project evaluations and will determine the level of mitigation required and whether a project is eligible to use a mitigation bank a ideally mitigation banks should be a way of restoring and creating wetlands in advance of development projects that result in wetland losses however to promote the establishment of mitigation banks this chapter provides for limited incremental sales of uncertified credits and for the issuance of watershed development permits based on uncertified credits according to the guidelines found in subsection m16 mitigation bank credit sales of this section this provision is considered necessary to increase the economic viability of mitigation banks because the development plan for any given bank site may require the sale of a minimum number of credits before wetlands may be restored or constructed it is recognized that a temporary deficit of wetlands may result to address this possibility the smc will require a higher mitigation ratio for the use of uncertified and conditionally certified credit and for funds to be maintained in an appropriate financial security to ensure construction of the banks wetlands this chapter also limits the number of credits that can be sold prior to construction and prior to conditional certification it also establishes a maximum amount of time that may elapse before preconstruction credit sales are converted to conditionally certified or fully certified credits b emphasis will be on the replacement of wetland acreage and type therefore the preferred method of generating wetland bank credits will be the restoration of former wetlands or the creation of new wetlands which will result in a net gain in wetland acreage on the bank site permanent wetland enhancement as a means of generating bank credits can be performed as specified in subsection m14 establishing mitigation bank credits of this section appropriate functional value assessment methodologies and credit ratios will be determined for each site by the smc c mitigation banks generally shall be held to a higher standard of performance than conventional wetland mitigation sites these standards are detailed in subsection m19 performance standards of this section d permit applications for wetland impacts to high quality aquatic resources generally will not be considered for mitigation banking until the applicant has shown compliance with the avoidance and minimization requirements of this chapter e the mitigation bank once established must be dedicated to maintaining the wetland functions and values to the exclusion of other conflicting uses as determined by the smc 7 site selection criteria the bank site will be reviewed with respect to the following site selection criteria failure to meet any of these criteria may be depending on circumstances grounds for rejection of a bank site the site shall a be owned andor under the full control of the bank b contain a majority of drained or hydrologically modified hydric soils recognizing that restoration of former wetlands is a preferred form of mitigation c have no high quality aquatic resources that would be adversely affected by the construction or restoration work  sterling codifiers inc  480522 d contain adequate perimeter upland areas to buffer the wetlands from potentially incompatible land uses on adjoining parcels and meet the buffer requirements of this chapter e be so situated that adequate hydrology can be ensured eg be located on a floodplain or possess a high groundwater table f be proximate or adjacent to public land holdings so as to create contiguous large scale habitat areas g be part of an adopted or accepted open space plan watershed plan conservancy district protected riparian corridor or other local or regional conservation land use plan this criterion has been established in order to help implement local and regional conservation plans and to ensure maximum consistency and compatibility with future surrounding land uses h contain no known hazardous waste which must be confirmed by an environmental assessment conducted by a qualified person or firm i have a minimum size of ten 10 acres or five 5 acres if within the lake michigan watershed 8 bank ownership a mitigation bank may be either publicly or privately owned the bank may be incorporated as for profit or not for profit if the bank is incorporated it must be incorporated in the state of illinois publicly owned refers to ownership of the bank site by any federal state regional or local unit of government all land including associated uplands which are part of the mitigation bank shall be protected in perpetuity from future development by an appropriate deed or plat restriction this deed or plat restriction must be recorded with the recorder of deeds office attached to the abstract of title with a certified copy of the registration provided to the smc prior to the smc authorizing the bank the mitigation bank charter should also identify the entity responsible for the ownership and long term management of the site in addition the bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate funds for the operation and maintenance of the bank during its operational life as well as for long term management of the site bank sponsors are strongly encouraged to establish agreements for long term management with public or private conservation organizations transfer or sale of the mitigation bank may occur to a party willing and financially able to abide by the terms and conditions of the mitigation bank charter entered into by the smc and the bank owner any such transfer must be approved by the smc 9 initial planning the individual or entity proposing to sponsor establishment of a mitigation bank will initially hold informal discussions with the smc the purpose of these discussions will be to acquaint the sponsor with the legal regulatory and ecological background relevant to banking and to provide procedural guidance to the prospective applicant during this discussion the prospective bank sponsor will be informed that a formal request for the establishment of a bank must be made to the smc the formal request will include a prospectus and a watershed development permit application if required the bank sponsor and the smc shall develop an authorizing document for the bank that shall be signed by all parties the authorizing document should outline the responsibilities of the bank sponsor and contain the necessary information outlined in this chapter governing the operation of the bank 10 prospectus development the purpose of the prospectus is to provide sufficient information to allow the smc to determine if the general considerations and site evaluation criteria outlined in this chapter are likely to be met if the proposed bank is established it is understood that the prospectus will become the basis of the mitigation bank charter the prospectus should contain a the bank location and size  b a delineation of any wetlands or other jurisdictional areas that may exist at the proposed bank location  c the type of real estate interest in bank property  d a legal description of the property  e the type of bank ie single client general use market oriented etc  f the method of credit production ie restoration creation enhancement the number of proposed credits by each method and the rationale for crediting  g a statement as to compliance with this document  h a general site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed wetland and upland habitats roads trails structures utilities and any other existing or proposed site improvements  i an outline of management and maintenance responsibilities  j a preliminary construction plan and schedule of completion preliminary planting plan and preliminary administrative management monitoring and financial plans  and k a charter of incorporation for the mitigation bank if appropriate 11 financial assurances the bank sponsor is responsible for securing sufficient funds or other financial assurances to cover contingency actions in the event of bank default or failure in addition the bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate funding to monitor and maintain the bank throughout its operational life and to make provision for long term management assurances or with land management organizations or agencies total funding requirements should reflect realistic cost estimates for monitoring long term maintenance contingency and remedial actions financial assurances may be in the form of performance bonds irrevocable letters of credit irrevocable trusts escrow accounts casualty insurance or other approved sureties such assurances may be phased out or reduced once it has been demonstrated that the bank is functionally mature andor selfsustaining in accordance with the approved performance standards the financial plan must demonstrate that the bank and its wetlands can be maintained in perpetuity whether ownership or by conveyance to a public or private agency that will assume the responsibilities of the bank 12 mitigation bank application process the sponsor must submit a watershed development permit application and a prospectus for the initial development of the bank upon receipt of these items the smc shall begin a public interest review on the prospectus with input from government agencies and the general public the public will be notified of all proposed banks by a public notice issued by the smc for a thirty 30 day comment period copies of all comments received during the public notice comment period will be given to the bank sponsor full consideration will be given to all comments received in evaluating the bank proposal the bank sponsor and the smc shall develop an authorizing document for the bank the authorizing document should outline the responsibilities of the bank sponsor and contain the necessary information outlined in this chapter governing the operation of the bank additionally the details of the bank sponsors responsibilities shall be noted in any watershed development  sterling codifiers inc  481522 permit in which the permittees mitigation responsibilities are met use of the mitigation bank smc shall make a site inspection of the bank area a written response to the banking prospectus indicating the prospective banks feasibility would then be prepared by the smc based upon observations made during the site visit an indication of feasibility in the letter should be interpreted as general acceptability of conceptual bank plans and either probable issuance of a watershed development permit or probable signatory approval of a mitigation bank charter upon completion of detailed plans the formal request to the smc for establishment of a bank shall include a a watershed development permit application to conduct the proposed work that is necessary to establish the bank  b a copy of the previously described prospectus  and c a plan that details the goals objectives and success criteria for creating wetlands including wetland types and their respective acreages 13 detailed planning stage this is the final planning stage leading to issuance of a watershed development permit for authorization implementation and operation of a bank the preparation of detailed plans should be closely coordinated with the smc and other local authorities as appropriate each mitigation bank shall have a site development plan that must be approved by the smc this plan shall identify and incorporate the following to the extent practicable and appropriate a diverse aquatic and supporting landscapes eg shallow open water riparian wetlands deep and shallow marshes floodplain forests wet meadows and prairies upland buffers etc which are interrelated one to the other so as to maximize wetland functions and values  b diverse wildlife habitats and associated edge conditions  c associated upland buffer areas contiguous to the wetlands to protect the wetlands from potential adverse effects of adjacent land uses specifying the width and area of all such zones  d wetland functions which will be created or enhanced by maximizing vegetative diversity and abundance structuring specific wildlife habitats optimizing wetland hydrology and providing public access  e species native to the area  f the use of native soils on the site  g the means for establishing the appropriate hydrology  and h the mitigation bank shall be designed to be as selfsufficient as possible and minimize maintenance 14 establishing mitigation bank credits the units of wetland credit shall be acres of wetland mitigation bank credits shall be generated as wetlands are created restored or enhanced on the bank site resulting in an increase in wetland acreage andor quality on the bank site banking credits may be generated as follows full credit will be given for wetland creation from upland and for restoration of former wetlands partial credit 25 percent of the enhanced wetland acreage can be given for permanent enhancement eg reestablishment of hydrology of degraded wetlands a maximum of thirty percent 30% of the total potential credits generated by the bank may consist of enhanced wetlands or enhanced uplands 15 credit certification mitigation bank credits shall be certifiable by the smc when the bank credits conform to the criteria outlined in subsection m19 performance standards of this section credits may be certifiable at any time but the standards for certification shall be met no later than five 5 years from the date of planting unless otherwise specified in the bank charter and approved by the smc after the second full growing season following creation or restoration of wetlands the smc may conditionally certify the credits of the bank based on reasonable progress toward achieving the performance standards conditional certification shall be based on degree of conformance with the standards for conditional certification in subsection m19 performance standards of this section and on any interim corrective measures recommended by the smc at the end of five 5 years if any of the above conditions are not met the authorized agent of the bank shall submit a plan to the smc outlining corrective measures to be taken based on the ecological conditions of the site management activities shall continue until the standards are met as verified by the smc certain types of enhancement of existing wetland can be an acceptable way of generating credits if the enhancement actions are scientifically sound and result in a substantial measurable and permanent increase in the level of wetland function the types of enhancement that will be acceptable include the following a restoration of wetland hydrology at sites that have been significantly modified drainage or ditch drainage b restoration of diverse native plant communities where the original plant community has been totally destroyed and the site is currently farmed or has revegetated with aggressive andor exotic species such as reed canary grass cattails purple loosestrife phragmites buckthorn or other species restoration goals would include the removal of the exotic or aggressive species and the introduction and establishment of a diverse assemblage of native species appropriate for the site considering geographic location soils hydrology and other factors selective removal of exotic species in otherwise healthy native plant communities will normally not be considered eligible for credit c restoration of deep marsh habitat impoundment where the purpose is to create hemimarsh conditions suitable for nesting by target wetland bird species of concern this approach is appropriate at sites that have been significantly altered drainage and consist largely of dense monotypic stands of cattails or other aggressive species it is not appropriate for sites that have existing biodiversity or habitat values that would be adversely affected by the proposed actions or where the level of benefit would be minimal the prospectus must specifically state which aspects of wetland function would be increased as a result of the enhancement actions the level to which they would be increased and the scientific basis for expecting the increase it must also include a narrative description of how the enhancement would be accomplished a schedule of completion explicit performance standards and performance milestones for enhancement actions to be carried out over an extended period of time performance standards for enhancement work will be approved as part of the watershed development permit actions such as the restoration of hydrology can be implemented in a very short time and can be measured water level responses plant community restoration is a lengthier process requiring sustained effort over a period of time in such cases interim performance milestones may be established and credits resulting from such work would be included in the final thirty percent 30% increment of credit released from the bank  sterling codifiers inc  482522 credit ratios will be determined based on specific circumstances for each bank restoration of a historic wetland area or creation of a wetland from an upland area would receive a credit ratio of one hundred percent 100% actions that restore a very degraded wetland to a high degree of function such as restoring normal hydrology to a drained wetland or restoring a high level of species diversity to a monotypic plant community shall receive credit at a maximum ratio of twenty five percent 25% of the credit values awarded to restored or created wetlands all created restored or enhanced wetland areas on the mitigation bank site shall at a minimum meet the buffer width requirements of subsection 109550501 of this chapter all existing high quality aquatic resources on the mitigation bank site shall at a minimum meet the buffer width requirements of subsection 109550501 of this chapter the inclusion of upland and deep water environments within a wetland mitigation bank may be inadvertent ie due to topographic reasons and real estate considerations or planned ie to realize or enhance certain wetland functions in the latter case upland areas may be either naturally occurring or be artificially created and depending on their basic purpose may occur along the periphery of the bank or be dispersed throughout enhanced upland areas or enhanced wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements of this chapter for the mitigation bank shall be credited at twenty five percent 25% of the enhanced acreage completed created or restored wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements of this chapter for the mitigation bank shall be credited at seventy five percent 75% of the acreage created or restored conditional certification will allow for a reduction of the posted financial security to a level sufficient to assure full certification corrective measures will be approved by the smc prior to implementation these measures should ensure that the mitigation standard is met at the end of the five 5 year management period from the day the planting is completed during construction of the mitigation wetlands qualified personnel must make periodic inspections of the site to ensure that soil erosion control measures are employed and functioning properly inspection reports shall be submitted to the smc on a monthly basis 16 mitigation bank credit sales upon authorization of the mitigation bank watershed development permit the sale of wetland credits and the creation or restoration of wetlands and buffers may commence the mitigation bank credits may be sold for mitigation purposes in accordance with the following conditions a certified credits and conditionally certified credits may be sold provided that adequate funds as approved by the smc are established escrow account performance bond irrevocable letter of credit or other financial surety for the generation of certified credits and long term maintenance of the bank site b if an approved bank has only uncertified credits then those uncertified credits may be sold for mitigation purposes provided that adequate funds as approved by the smc are established escrow account performance bond irrevocable letter of credit or other financial surety for the generation of credits and long term maintenance of the required bank site c the smc has sole authority to determine the number of credits available for withdrawal from the mitigation bank d all mitigation bank credit sales shall require prior approval by the smc to confirm credit availability and compliance with all other provisions of this chapter in every event the mitigation bank sponsor shall establish in a performance bond escrow account irrevocable letter of credit or other financial surety adequate funds to ensure the construction planting and long term monitoring management and maintenance of the mitigation bank wetlands and associated uplands the amount of the financial surety shall be based upon the calculated per acre cost of completing the approved plan including grading and planting of the site cost estimates for the construction andor planting and maintenance for all restored created or enhanced wetlands in the bank must be presented a proposed schedule of release of the financial surety following completion of specific tasks associated with the establishment of the bank must also be submitted for approval construction estimates shall include an estimate of the cubic yards of earth to be moved during the grading of the site as well as an estimated cost per cubic yard for the earthwork the interest on all such escrow accounts may be used by the bank sponsor for monitoring management and maintenance purposes only the financial sureties must be maintained until all credits have been certified and sold or the smc has determined the mitigation bank is selfsustaining the amount of the financial surety will be reviewed annually based on the results of the monitoring report for all mitigation banks credit sales may commence upon approval of the banks charter a maximum of thirty percent 30% of the total potential credits may be sold prior to construction based on approval of the banks charter and the posting of adequate financial surety upon acceptance by the smc that appropriate wetland hydrology has been demonstrated throughout all proposed wetlands at the site an additional twenty percent 20% of the total credits may be sold upon acceptance by the smc that the site has been planted according to the approved plan and after wetland hydrology has been demonstrated another twenty percent 20% of the total credits may be sold the final thirty percent 30% of the total credits may be sold upon full certification incremental demonstration of wetland hydrology and incremental planting of the site may also be awarded credit for example piezometer data from a fifty 50 acre wetland restoration area shows that thirty seven 37 acres of the planned wetland meets the wetland hydrology criterion of the 1987 federal wetland delineation manual as amended including applicable supplements these thirty seven 37 acres represent seventy four percent 74% of the proposed wetland area by applying this seventy four percent 74% factor to the allowable twenty percent 20% increment of credits awarded for demonstrating wetland hydrology the allowable increment of new credits for the bank would equal 148 percent of the proposed wetland on the site 074 x 20    or 148% the same method would be used for calculating credits due to incremental planting in the event that the bank sponsor sells more than the number of credits approved by the smc the smc reserves the right to deduct the amount of the oversale from the total potential credits available from the bank these credits will not be restored even if future development of the bank results in the certification of additional credit sales no watershed development permits will be granted to applicants proposing to use a mitigation bank unless credits are available in the bank as specified in this chapter the initial physical and biological improvements at the bank site including but not limited to grading planting and restoration of wetland hydrology must be completed no later than the end of the third full growing season following the sale of the first mitigation bank credit the bank sponsor shall keep a ledger of all available credits whether purchased or unpurchased and of all credits sold or otherwise debited including individual sale prices this ledger shall be made available to the smc upon request in addition the bank sponsor must provide the smc an updated ledger containing a list of all transactions including sale prices at a given bank to date at the conclusion of every credit sale  sterling codifiers inc  483522 17 monitoring management and reporting monitoring shall occur for a period of five 5 years from the date of the completion of the approved planting plan management shall proceed on a continuing basis from the completion of planting end of the monitoring period management shall proceed as needed to reconcile current conditions with functional goals any required remedial measures will be based on information contained in monitoring reports andor from smc site inspections the monitoring results of the mitigation bank shall be provided to the smc on an annual basis during the monitoring period following this no report shall be required but the smc shall retain the right to inspect the mitigation bank as deemed appropriate the smc shall hold on file copies of any reports the smc will establish an annual compliance monitoring schedule that assures that all mitigation bank sites are inspected for compliance with the approved bank plan the mitigation bank sponsor shall be responsible for all monitoring management and reporting however the work may be done by bank employees subcontractors or public or private organizations the operational life of a bank shall consist of the period during which the terms and conditions of the mitigation bank charter are in effect with the exception of arrangements for the long term management and protection in perpetuity of the wetlands andor other aquatic resources and associated uplands the operational life of a mitigation bank terminates at the point when a wetland mitigation credits have been exhausted or banking activity is voluntarily terminated with written notice from the bank sponsor to the smc  or b the smc has determined that the debited bank is functionally mature andor selfsustaining to the degree specified in the mitigation bank charter and associated documents including the performance standards outlined in this chapter 18 loss of bank charter should a bank not meet the terms of its charter for whatever reason the smc shall inform the bank sponsor and shall specify a reasonable period of time in which to comply should any modifications to the charter be required recommended changes shall be approved by the smc continued nonperformance of the bank shall result in revocation of the charter and forfeiture of financial securities 19 performance standards the following performance standards are established to ensure that mitigation banks create wetlands which compare favorably with moderate to high quality natural wetlands with respect to diversity abundance and distribution of plant species and also to ensure that the created wetlands exhibit the hydrologic regimes of natural wetlands these standards will be used to measure the performance of mitigation banks unless otherwise stated in the mitigation bank charter the bank sponsor may propose other standards if native plant restoration is not the primary goal of the mitigation bank for example wildlife habitat enhancement goals may require the development of alternative standards based on habitat structure such as the interspersion of open water and cattails or the seasonal establishment of mud flats justification for alternative standards must be provided in the bank prospectus the smc retains approval authority for any performance standards proposed which are different from those contained in this chapter a species composition species selected for the planting shall be native to lake county ref swink and wilhelm plants of the chicago region 4th edition 1994 and shall be appropriate for the hydrologic zone to be planted a minimum number of native perennial species proposed for establishment must be present within each plant community to meet certification standards as follows marsh minimum of fifteen 15 native perennial species mesic prairie buffer minimum of twenty

a precise way of specifying colors and showing the relationships among colors the munsell colororder system is applicable to all possible colors every color has three attributes hue value and chroma the munsell system establishes numerical scales with visually uniform steps for each of these attributes the munsell book of color displays a collection of colored chips arranged according to these scales each chip is identified numerically using these scales the color of any surface can be identified by comparing it to the chips under proper illumination and viewing conditions the color is then identified by its hue value and chroma these attributes are given the symbols h v and c and are written in a form h vc which is called the munsell notation hue hue is that attribute of a color by which we distinguish red from green blue from yellow etc there is a natural order of hues red yellow green blue purple one can mix paints of adjacent colors and obtain a continuous variation from one color to the other the series of hues from red to purple returns to its starting point so it can be arranged in a circle munsell called red yellow green blue and purple principal hues and placed them at equal intervals around the color circle he inserted five intermediate hues yellowred greenyellow bluegreen purpleblue and redpurple making ten hues in all for simplicity the munsell color system uses the initials as symbols to designate the ten hue sectors r yr y gy g bg b pb p and rp the munsell color system arbitrarily divides the hue circle into 100 steps of equal visual change in hue with the zero point at the beginning of the red sector hue may be identified by a number from 0 to 100 however the meaning is more obvious when the hue is identified by the hue sector and a step based on a scale of ten within that sector for example the hue in the middle of the red sector is called five red and is written 5r the zero step is not used so there is a 10r hue but no 0 yr value value indicates the lightness of a color the scale of value ranges from 0 for pure black to 10 for pure white black white and the grays between them are called neutral colors they have no hue the colors that do have hue are called chromatic colors the value scale applies to both neutral and chromatic colors chroma chroma is the degree of departure of a color from the neutral color of the same value colors of low chroma are sometimes called weak while those of high chroma are said to be highly saturated strong or vivid if you started with a gray paint and vivid yellow paint of the same value and gradually added the yellow to the gray until the yellow color was obtained you would develop a series of gradually changing colors that increase in chroma the munsell scaling of chroma is intended to be visually uniform and is nearly so the units are arbitrary the scale starts at zero for neutral colors but there is no arbitrary end to the scale the chroma scale for normal reflecting materials extends beyond 20 in some cases fluorescent materials may have chromas as high as 30 more information a copy of the munsell book of color is available for reference viewing at the development services department at the barrington village hall to obtain more information on the munsell system or to order materials see the web sites the munsell system of color notation munsell color chart or munsell
