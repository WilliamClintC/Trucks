chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health and property  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges due to flooding and erosion  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future floodprone areas  7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard 8 ensure that those occupying special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions  9 minimize development in floodplains to preserve the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community  10 control and manage stormwater runoff the sediment load and pollutant load from points and surfaces within developments  and 11 establish a reasonable standard of design for development to minimize potential flood and erosion damage  51616 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the conveyance of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  51616 article ii

consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the citys public facilities systems 2 applicability an appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land to construct improvements or to pay development fees other than impact fees for a public infrastructure improvement which requirement is imposed under

proposed subdivision c proportionality determination by public works director prior to a decision by the planning and zoning commission on a preliminary plat application or if no preliminary plat application is required on a final plat application filed under this chapter the public works director or his designee shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the citys public facilities systems taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed the cost of such proportionality analysis shall be borne solely by the applicant 1 in making his proportionality determination the public works director may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to onsite improvements  the proposed or potential use of the land  the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities  impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the citys public facilities systems  the function of the public

mixed use in accordance with a pd concept plan that may include uses regulations and other requirements that vary from the provisions of other zoning districts pd districts are intended to implement generally the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan pd districts are also intended to encourage flexible and creative planning to ensure the compatibility of land uses to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community and to result in a higher quality development for the community than would result from the use of conventional zoning districts in most circumstances a pd district will be approved as an overlay zoning district in circumstances however where newly annexed land is subject to an agreement that includes an integrated development plan and development standards that do not fit the purpose statement and standards of a base zoning districts the project may be approved as a freestanding pd district  applicability a pd district may only be established if one 1 or more of the following circumstances apply a the land is located in close proximity to established residential neighborhoods where conventional zoning classifications may not adequately address neighborhood concerns regarding the quality or compatibility of the adjacent development and where it may be desirable to the neighborhood the developer or the city to develop and implement mutually agreed enforceable development standards  b the land or adjacent property that would be impacted by the development of the land has sensitive or unique environmental features requiring a more flexible approach to zoning and clustering of uses or special design standards in order to afford the best possible protection of the unique qualities of the site or the adjacent property  c the land is proposed for development as a mixeduse development or a traditional neighborhood development requiring more flexible and innovative design standards  d the land consists of areas that are proposed for redevelopment or infill development and special design considerations are deemed desirable  e the land serves as transition between different and seemingly incompatible land uses  f the land is proposed for development as a major office retail commercial or industrial employment center and special design standards may be warranted  g the land is of such a character that it is in the communitys best interest to encourage high quality development development standards to further the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan  h the land
