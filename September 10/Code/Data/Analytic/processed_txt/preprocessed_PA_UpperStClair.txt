accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the costs of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources 994 upper st clair code 994 99148  a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment  stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams  the use of
