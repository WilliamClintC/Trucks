sixty percent 60% of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period all survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be counted as singleoccupant vehicles for purposes of calculating avr or ver dif sixty percent 60% or more of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period one half 12 of those survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be assumed to have the same avr or ver as that calculated from the responses to the surveys returned and one half 12 shall be counted as singleoccupant vehicles for purposes of calculating avr or ver eavr for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total employee days for the survey week by the total vehicle trip days for the survey week fver for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total vehicle trip days for the

period each work day monday of the survey week each day of the survey week that an employee starts work during the peak period counts as one 1 employee day for example an employee who starts work each day monday of the survey week between 6 am and 10 am counts as five 5 employee days the following procedures are used in totaling employee days 1employees telecommuting or who are off due to a compressed work week schedule are counted as reporting to the work site in calculating the total employee days iithe following employees are not included in the employee days total 1employees not working because of vacation sickness or other time off  2employees who report to a different work site or an offsite workrelated activity  3disabled employees hvehicle trip days shall be determined as follows ithe total number of vehicles used by employees who start work or are assigned to the work site each work day monday of the survey week a vehicle trip day is based on the means of transportation used for the greatest distance of an employees hometowork commute trip an employee who starts work during the peak period and arrives at the work site each day of the survey week monday in a singleoccupant vehicle counts as five 5 vehicle trip days the following numerical values are used in calculating the total vehicle trip days 1singleoccupant vehicle drive alone equals one 1  2carpool equals one 1 divided by the number of people in the carpool  3vanpool equals one 1 divided by the number of employees in the vanpool  4motorcycle moped motorized scooter or motor bike equal

compressed days off viidisabled employee vehicles at all times iemployers or employment centers with multiple work sites within the jurisdiction have the option to average individual work site avr or ver to demonstrate that the performance objectives are achieved on an aggregate basis for those work sites when this jurisdiction is implementing this chapter if the employer demonstrates that the performance objectives  are achieved using the averaging methodology then those work sites included in the averaging are not subject to the requirements of ithe weighted avr average for the multiple work sites is calculated by 1 adding together the employee days for each work site 2 adding together the vehicle trip days for each work site then 3 dividing the aggregate employee days by the aggregate vehicle trip days to obtain the weighted avr average iithe weighted ver average for the multiple work sites is calculated by dividing the aggregate vehicle trip days by the aggregate employee days iiithe weighted ver average for multiple work sites can also be calculated as the number of peakperiod employees multiplied by ver site 1 plus the number of peakperiod employees multiplied by ver site 2 divided by the total peakperiod employees sites 1 and 2 part eff  5 random sample method the method described in this section must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of asummary ic provides an option for larger work sites to calculate avr or ver based upon a random sample of the employee population the random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred 400 or more employees start work during the peak period  am am iithe size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site the means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in bii iiithe sample must be selected as described in biv once the sample group has been selected the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group this will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employers option to utilize the random sample method iva high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate avr or ver for the work site the employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample all nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drivealone commuters ie commuting in a singleoccupant vehicle for purposes of calculating the work site avr or ver bbasic random sample selection methodology ithe employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site in alphabetical order and assign a consecutive number to each employee the employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the  am am peak period iithe employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula where n is the sample size and n is the number of employees who start work between  am and  am image a sample of size n based on this formula should produce an avr or ver with a sampling error of at most plusorminus 005 with a ninetyfive percent 95% probability the sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below number of peak period employees at work site sample size 400 to 420 200 421 to 440 205 441 to 460 210 461 to 480 214 481 to 500 218 501 to 550 225 551 to 600 235 601 to 650 240 651 to 700 248 701 to 750 255 751

can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table the employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey a larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population  provided that the employer obtains a high response rate ivafter the sample size has been determined the employer has two options for selecting the sample 1use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list eg two hundred seventy eight 278 distinct random numbers between one 1 and one thousand 1000 where one thousand 1000 employees start work during the peak period 2select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number vto determine the sampling interval the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the  am am peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer example if a work site has 1000 employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is 278 then the sampling interval equals 1000 divided by 278   36 the 36 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval therefore every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number x where x is between 1 and 3 if x equals 3 then the sample would include 3 6 9 12 15 etc until the required 278 numbers have been selected the methodology described in subsection biv of this section will eliminate potential bias that could result from choosing survey participants on the basis of department rank income level home zip code or other demographic factors or from excluding certain segments of the employee population cselection process for subsequent surveys iin subsequent surveys the employer may select the random sample using the method described in subsection b of this section or the employer may choose to survey the same employees that were included in the previous random sample employees in the previous random sample group who have left the organization shall be replaced in the new sample by employees selected per subsection b of this section the latter approach may enable the employer to more accurately track changes in commute mode from one survey to the next iiif the number of employees who start work between  am and  am has increased or decreased by more than twenty percent 20% since the last survey the employer shall select a completely new random sample group using the methodology described in subsection b of this section dperformance objective calculation reporting and recordkeeping iavr or ver must be calculated according to the methodology described in iithe employer shall submit to the jurisdiction athe completed survey forms for processing of the results of the survey according to the schedule in f and g  ba description of the methodology used to select the random sample  ca tally showing the number of surveys distributed the number completed and the number

hereby authorized to reform the provisions of this chapter in order to preserve the maximum permissible effect thereof part eff sep 18 2008 5 findings the people of the city of emeryville believe it is proper to regulate employment conditions at large hotels first rather than trying to regulate all employers because they believe that a large hotels are better able to afford the proposed conditions than other kinds of employers  b many large hotels in the bay area are already meeting the employment conditions required by this article unlike the situation in other industries  c large hotels provide jobs similar to the janitorial jobs already protected by a similar state law on worker retention labor   and d large hotels are generally less likely to respond to such regulation by closing or reducing employment than other kinds of businesses which can more readily move jobs offshore or to other locations as large hotels wish to be here because of our citys location each of these factors alone is sufficient to warrant adoption of this article part eff sep 18 2008 limitations during investigation of administrative complaints repealed by eff sep 18 2008 chapter 33

variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of emeryville to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bconditions for variances 1generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in ii upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of emeryville need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of emeryville believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that ithe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and iisuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the alameda county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency cappeal board 1in passing upon requests for variances the city of emeryville shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of

system and streets and bridges 2variances shall only be issued upon a ishowing of good and sufficient cause  iidetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iiidetermination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see

development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4upon consideration of the factors and the purposes of this chapter the city of emeryville may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
