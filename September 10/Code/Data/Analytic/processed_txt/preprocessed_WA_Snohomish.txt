require the petitioners to compensate the city of snohomish prior to the vacation becoming effective in accordance with the following criteria aif the city council determines in its discretion to grant the petition for vacation or any part thereof the council may by ordinance vacate such street or alley except as otherwise provided herein such ordinance shall not become effective until the city is compensated in an amount which does not exceed onehalf the appraised value of the area to be vacated  bnotwithstanding a above when the street or alley has been part of a dedicated public rightofway for twentyfive years or more or when the street or alley or portions thereof were acquired at public expense an amount that does not exceed the full appraised value of the area vacated  ccompensation may be waived or reduced either when the vacation is initiated by the city of snohomish or when the city council deems it to be in the best interest of the city in accordance with the following criteria 1when the abutting property is owned by a governmental entity or by a nonprofit corporation whose purpose is for the necessary support of the poor or infirm  or 2when the street or alley was vacated by the provisions of laws of 188990 as described in smc  3when the street or alley rightofway vacated is traded for property of greater or approximately equal value  4when the street or alley rightofway vacated is abutting residential properties and is 1500 square feet or less the appraisal required under smc section  may be waived and the value calculated as a percentage of the average snohomish county assessor assessed value of the abutting properties 5when the street or alley rightofway vacated is de minimis under 500 square feet or otherwise has little to no assessed value         nonuser statute alaws 188990 is known as the nonuser statute and reads as follows any county road or part thereof which remains unopen for public use for a period of five years after the order is made or authority granted for opening it shall be thereby vacated and the authority for building it barred by lapse of time bthe nonuser statute was amended in 1909 by adding a significant proviso which is set forth in the current codified version of the statute which reads as follows rcw  vacation of road unopened for five years  exceptions any county road or part thereof which remains unopen for public use for a period of five years after the order is made or authority granted for opening it shall be thereby vacated and the authority for building it barred by lapse of time provided that this section shall not apply to any highway road street alley or other public place dedicated as such in any plat whether the land included in such plat is within or without the limits of an incorporated city or town or to any land conveyed by deed to the state or to any county city or town for highways roads streets alleys or other public places cthe proviso in rcw  exempts streets dedicated in a plat from the nonuser statute in applying this proviso the statute cannot have a retroactive effect if it would interfere with vested rights thus where a county road was dedicated and unopened for five years prior to the 1909 proviso and was not annexed into a city during said five year period the right of abutting property owners to the vacated road vested and is unaffected by the proviso on the other hand where the fiveyear period had not run by the time of the 1909 proviso the abutting property owner did not have a vested right and the proviso saved the unopened road from automatic vacation dalthough the nonuser statute applies without regard to the citys street vacation process under ch 3579 rcw property owners who abut a street vacated under the nonuser statute may nonetheless apply to the city to formally vacate the street by ordinance abutting property owners may use this method to clear title to rightofway vacated under the nonuser statute rather than filing a quiet title action in superior court which can be more costly and cumbersome than the street vacation ordinance process accordingly the city will consider petitions to formally vacate streets or alleys that have been vacated by operation of the nonuser statute if said streets or alleys were dedicated and unopened as county roads for five years prior to the 1909 proviso and if the city has not acquired said streets or alleys by prescription adverse possession purchase eminent domain or other means the burden shall be on the property owner requesting vacation to provide all necessary title and historical information to the city to demonstrate that the nonuser statute operates to vacate the subject property   public hearing notice fifty percent objection aupon the passage of the resolution referenced in smc  the city clerk shall give twenty days notice of the pendency of the petition by a written notice posted in three of the most public places in the city and a like notice in a conspicuous place on the street or alley sought to be vacated the said notice shall contain a statement that a petition has been filed to vacate the street or alley described in the notice together with a statement of the time and place fixed for the hearing of the petition in all cases where the proceeding is initiated by resolution of the city without a petition having been signed by

part thereof sought to be vacated or within 300 feet thereof as shown on the rolls of the county treasurer directed to the addresses thereon shown failure to send notice by mail to any such property owner where the current address of such property owner is not a matter of public record shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with the proposed street vacation the costs of the notice shall be borne by the applicant bin all cases the city shall be prohibited from proceeding further with the street vacation process if fifty percent or more of the abutting property owners file written objection to the proposed vacation with the city clerk prior to the time of hearing     appraisal fees ain all cases where the city council requires compensation for the vacated rightofway except for those cases where compensation is waived pursuant to smc  c an appraisal of the rightofway proposed for vacation shall be made said appraisal shall be by a professional appraiser selected

are established to provide flexibility in project design provide solar access and maintain privacy between adjacent uses  interpretation of tables athis chapter defines general design and dimension standards for the various land use designations as well as requirements specific to a particular land use designation bthere are two separate tables which are arranged in a matrix format table 1 contains the requirements for the commercial and industry land use designations table 2 contains the requirements for all of the residential land use designations as well as the open space and urban horticulture land use designations the types of dimensional standards are listed down the left side of the table and the land use designations are listed at the top the matrix boxes contain the minimum dimensional requirements of the land use designation a blank box indicates that there are no specific requirements   measurement methods the following measurement methods shall be used to determine compliance with the dimensional standards in this chapter astreet setbacks shall be measured from the existing edge of a street rightofway or temporary turnaround blot widths shall be measured by scaling a circle of the applicable diameter within the boundaries of the lot  provided that an access easement shall not be included within the circle cfor any calculation which ends in a fraction of 05 or greater the number will be rounded up to the next whole number any fraction less than 05 will be rounded down to the next whole number dlot area shall be the total horizontal land area contained within the boundaries of a lot eopen space calculations shall include areas of turf landscaping natural vegetation or surface water retentiondetention facilities including vegetated areas within low impact development facilities   lot area prohibited reduction any portion of a lot that was required to calculate and ensure compliance with the standards and regulations of this title shall not be subsequently subdivided or segregated from such lot  lot divided by land use designation boundary when a lot is divided by a land use designation boundary the following rules shall apply awhen a lot contains both residential and nonresidential land uses the boundary between shall be considered a lot line for determining permitted building height and required setbacks on the site buses on each portion of the lot shall only be those permitted in the land use designation applicable to such portion  division of multifamily residential use where a lot is devoted to a multifamily residential use involving more than one separate building such lot shall not be divided except when each proposed division complies with the requirements as to minimum lot area setback parking and other conditions required for the land use designation in which such lot is located except as provided for unit lot subdivisions in smc    directional sense of the purpose of applying regulations having a directional relationship to lots the directional sense of lots shall be determined as follows afront direction 1when a lot adjoins one street front direction shall be toward the street 2when the lot adjoins two streets which intersect on the boundaries of such lot front direction shall be toward that street from which the address is based and the primary pedestrian entrance is taken 3when the lot adjoins two streets which do not intersect on the boundaries of such lot front direction may be taken toward either street  provided that no other condition exists which in the discretion of the city planner dictates the front direction 4when the lot adjoins no street and access is by a private easement the city planner shall have discretionary authority to determine the front direction considering location of entrance to such lot topography orientation of the proposed building orientation of existing buildings andor logical orientation of future buildings on adjoining lots and any other considerations pertinent to a specific case brear direction shall be taken as opposite to the front direction or as nearly so as the lot shape permits cside direction shall be taken at a ninetydegree angle to the front direction or as nearly so as the lot shape permits  contiguous lots owned by the same person may be used to satisfy the requirements of the respective land use designation if the property owner is willing to consolidate the lots to reflect the single use of the land under the provisions of a recorded covenant  noncontiguous contiguous lots which are owned by the same individual but physically separated by a street alley river or some other form of manmade or natural barrier shall not be used jointly to satisfy the requirements of any land use designation

nonconforming front yard setbacks the required front yard setback for such lot may be the average of the two 2 nonconforming setbacks or 60 percent of the required street setback whichever results in the greater street setback bwhen deviations from standard setbacks are permitted for unit lot subdivisions pursuant to the provisions of smc      setbacks utilities ain subdivisions and short plats areas used to convey public utility services shall be contained in separate tracts rightsofway or easements bfor other types of land development permits easements shall be used to delineate such

intersections between streets between streets and alleys and between streets and private driveways there shall be no sight obstruction a visibility triangle shall be maintained for all corner lots in all residential districts the visibility triangle shall be determined by measuring lines from the intersection of the property lines abutting two 2 intersecting streets for a distance of fifteen 15 feet in both directions the terminus of the two line segments shall be connected by a third line to complete the area of the triangle in which sight obstruction shall not be permitted in conjunction with the normal side yard setback requirement of each land use designation  heights how to measure the building height is the vertical distance from the average adjoining curb elevation to the highest

community  fostering visual compatibility between adjacent uses and throughout the pilchuck district  establishing relationships of buildings to the public street and sidewalk that create continuous active interesting and intimate streetscapes  ensuring that the visual bulk of new buildings maintains a pedestrian scale to preserve a smalltown feel  minimizing the prominence of parking within the urban landscape  creating certainty for property owners and developers  and promoting a strong sense of identity for the pilchuck district neighborhood as a distinctive area of snohomish  context economic and physical development of the pilchuck district is envisioned to reflect and enhance the snohomish community which has been in existence for over 150 years the current pilchuck district reflects development over most of this period this long history has resulted in wide range of architectural styles building types scales uses and adaptive reuses representing the eras in which they were developed or modified the variety of urban forms and architectural expressions help to establish the overall visual character of snohomish by virtue of the many design influences and practical accommodations this character is eclectic while retaining a sense of history and smalltown scale the intent of these standards is to maintain and continue these qualities in new development while encouraging continuity and compatibility with the historic architectural traditions of the community these standards are not intended to replicate snohomishs historic district or to encourage development that conveys a false sense of history sites and buildings should reflect the era of their development while also acknowledging the historic context afforded by the snohomish community new development should include some design elements features andor materials that recognize snohomishs heritage while also adhering to contemporary design and construction methods additionally these standards implement the comprehensive plan policies that define the vision for the pilchuck district as a neighborhood these policies emphasize elements in the public and private frontages that foster a dynamic interesting and comfortable pedestrian landscape and a distinctive sense of place within the larger snohomish community the regulatory context provides four separate zones within the pilchuck district neighborhood single family neighborhood townhouse neighborhood center and neighborhood civic the character of each zone will vary with the type and intensity of land use identified zones designated for singlefamily and townhouse land uses are intended to retain a strongly residential appearance and scale consistent with the function elsewhere in the pilchuck district multistory buildings containing dwellings commercial and civic uses will be integrated to create a generally continuous and somewhat more compact row of buildings along the sidewalk the intent of these standards is to foster compatibility and continuity between adjacent uses and along streets to create a context where residents businesses and employees will coexist and thrive  applicability the provisions of

the best available science as set forth in the steward& associates study may 2004 prepared for the city by a team of qualified scientific professionals as well as such state agency publications as the example for designating and protecting critical areas prepared by the washington department of community trade and economic development cted and the guidance document for the establishment of critical

consider various growth management policies in promulgating development regulations such as the critical areas code in the city of snohomish the availability of affordable developable lots will be considerably diminished if certain regulations in the cted and doe recommendations are not modified to be less restrictive in such matters as wetland or stream buffer widths accordingly where the critical areas codes buffer widths differ from those in the example for designating and protecting critical areas or in the recommendations of the department of ecology the city finds that such

accommodating urban growth additionally the city finds that the best available science identifies no substantial risk to critical areas in enacting these alternative substantive requirements  purpose the city of snohomish is required by the washington state growth management act a rcw to designate environmentally critical areas and to adopt development regulations to assure the conservation of

buffer is poorly endowed with healthy native vegetation or is otherwise handicapped in its ability to protect the wetland as specified in subsection e of this section 3the city planner may reduce the required buffer width if the buffer is or after enhancement will be wellendowed with healthy native vegetation or otherwise unusually able to protect the wetland as specified in subsection e of this section ethe city planner may increase or reduce the standard buffer width if the functions served by the particular wetland needs more or less buffer width as indicated by a wetland functional analysis buffer widths may be reduced not more than 25 percent of the standardbaseline buffer width and only if restoration or enhancement occurs within the remaining buffer such that no net loss of

characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland for the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres restoration is divided into reestablishment and rehabilitation as follows areestablishment the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres brehabilitation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres 2creation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics present to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site where a wetland did not previously exist activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod create hydric soils and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species creation results in a gain in wetland acres 3enhancement the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten intensify or improve specific functions or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement flood water retention or wildlife habitat activities typically consist of planting vegetation controlling nonnative or invasive species modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods or some combination of these enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions but does not result in a gain in wetland acres 4the distinction between rehabilitation and enhancement for the purposes of the rating system is further explained as follows arehabilitation includes iactions that restore the original hydrogeomorphic hgm class or subclass to a wetland whose current hgm class or subclass has been changed as a result of human activities  and iiactions that restore the water regime that was present and maintained the wetland before human activities changed it benhancement includes iany other actions taken in existing wetlands iifor example a wetland that was once a forested riverine wetland was changed to a depressional emergent wetland by the construction of a dike and rehabilitating the wetland would involve breaching the dike so the wetland becomes a riverine wetland again removing the grazing and reforesting the area removing the grazing and reforesting the wetland without reestablishing the links to the riverine system would be considered as enhancement  aquifer recharge areas designation  exemptions  critical area reports  substantive requirements

needs of all economic segments of the community and to meet the goals and objectives of washingtons growth management act laws of 199 while maintaining high standards of design this chapter provides for density incentives which may be granted by the city when certain ownership management and occupancy criteria are met by the proposed lowincome development additionally in order to further encourage the development of lowincome housing within the city of snohomish this chapter will provide for relaxed parking requirements upon a showing by the project proponent that parking impacts of the project will be less than would be required by   eligibility this chapter allows for two types of lowincome density incentives a general lowincome housing density incentive may be granted to multifamily projects being developed within the low density multifamily residential medium multifamily residential and high density multifamily residential designations a lowincome senior housing density incentive may be granted to multifamily projects proposed in the low density multifamily residential medium density multifamily residential high density multifamily residential commercial and

eligible project under this chapter and conformance with the conditions and limitations stated in the covenant the covenant shall further state that the project must comply with the normal zoning and parking requirements if it ceases to be eligible under this chapter and that the city may enforce the covenant legal means 3the density incentive will not be permitted for projects with a preincentive development containing more than forty units upon any given site or within any given development to qualify for a density incentive a development must be no more than forty units and any development shall be separated from other developments qualifying for a density incentive by an unrelated land use under separate ownership other than a public or private street easement or buffer strip however where a 10 percent density bonus is requested for projects between twenty and forty units the 10 percent density bonus may be denied or reduced if shopping opportunities are not available within reasonable proximity and if neighborhood parks are not within reasonable proximity or recreational opportunities are not provided on site 4the project proponent will demonstrate studies that the increase in density will not result in a significant increase in the onstreet parking traffic park and utility impacts in the neighborhood over those which would be expected by a project developed at

be entitled to a credit under this section but the amount of the credit has yet to be determined on a per dwelling unit basis the city shall take the total credit amount available to the entire plat or project calculated by applying subsections a f of this section and divide that amount by the number of dwelling units planned for that plat or project the impact fee and credit may then be calculated and collected on a per dwelling unit basis as application is made for building permits where building permits for some but not all of the dwelling units within a plat or project have already been obtained at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective the credit for remaining dwelling units will be calculated to arrive at a per dwelling unit amount in the same manner for example if a plat is planned for 20 dwelling units and building permits have only been issued for 10 of those units the per dwelling unit credit for the remaining 10 units will equal the total credit amount divided by 20 gto utilize an approved credit to reduce impact fees assessed at the time of building permit issuance the credit must be requested prior to building permit issuance or it is deemed waived hno refund will be allowed in the event that the impact fee credit exceeds the amount of the impact fee itself  administrative adjustment of fee amount payment under protest awithin 14 days of issuance by the city of a building permit an applicant may appeal to the planning director for an adjustment to the fees imposed by this title the planning director may

of proof  5a user may appeal any enforcement action due to an upset as provided under this ordinance  6users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in smc  if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with other discharges from the same user would cause pass interference and that either aa local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  bno local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature of constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements for the purpose of this section bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility and severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections a and b that follow aif a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior written notice to the city at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible a user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or requirements within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided to the city within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain the following 1a description of the bypass and its cause  2the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times  3if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  4steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the city may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours bbypass is prohibited and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for bypass unless 1bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  3the user submitted notices as required under subsection a above   cost recovery by resolution
