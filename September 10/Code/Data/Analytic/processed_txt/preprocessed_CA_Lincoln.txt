numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of

11152016   findings the city council finds that the regulations enacted by this chapter and the modifications to the california construction are reasonably necessary because of local climatic topographical or geographical conditions present within the city of lincoln pursuant to california health and safety the city of lincoln has made certain modifications based on these climatic topographical and geographical conditions as follows average yearly rainfall for the city is approximately 1622 inches this rainfall normally occurs from october to april during the summer months there is generally no measurable precipitation temperatures for this dry period average from 80 to 100 degrees fahrenheit and are frequently accompanied by light to gusty northerly winds the city is surrounded by several hundred acres of grassland which in conjunction with the dry and sometimes windy climate creates a hazardous fire situation that has led to extensive grass and brush fires in recent years over the past decade the city has grown in population and continues development extending from the urban core into these grassland areas and at some locations oak tree covered areas in these areas of the city winddriven fires could lead to severe consequences as has been the case on several occasions in similar areas of the state uniquely for a city of its size the city is bisected by several topographical features including two ravines auburn ravine and markham ravine one railroad line union pacific and state highway 65 and state highway 193 as a result the city is divided into four different areas including the eastside east of the railroad westside west of the railroad lincoln hills south of auburn ravine and twelve bridges south of twelve bridges drive traffic between these areas is channeled into several thoroughfares which must cross the creeks railroad tracks and state highways by means of bridges or at grade crossings which are sometimes blocked by trains with only one overpass heavy traffic congestion on the citys major streets already acts as a barrier to timely response for fire equipment and emergency services in the event of an accident or other emergency at one of the main points of intersection between the road creek or railroad sections portions of the city could become isolated or emergency response times could be sufficiently slowed so as to increase the risk of substantial injury or damage these local climatic topographical and geographical conditions could potentially create serious concerns regarding the potential for an explosive fire situation and the inability of the city to provide a rapid emergency services response to various areas of the city additionally there are areas of the city that have larger homes located within their confines and private gated areas where homes are further apart as a result it is necessary to mitigate these issues by amending the california residential building and fire codes as provided for in california health and safety et seq requiring installation of hornstrobe devices for townhouses and one and twofamily dwellings during activation of the coderequired dwelling sprinkler system failure to enact this chapter with the amendments outlined could place the residents of the city of lincoln in a condition which would be perilous to their health and safety and therefore pursuant to california government a1 the requirements for hornstrobe devices during activation of the coderequired dwelling sprinkler system as required by this chapter shall be imposed as a condition to the issuance of a building permit for townhouses and one and twofamily dwellings pursuant to the requirements of the california building and residential codes of the california building standards  6 11152016 chapter 1505  expedited permit process for small residential rooftop solar systems   purpose and intent the purpose of the chapter is to provide an expedited streamlined solar

note  3exh a adopted  renumbered art vi   as art vii     natures of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this article of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  10132009   3exh a 6282016   conditions for variance a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the placer county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  10132009   3exh

system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the
