provisions of must be provided and approved as part of site plan approval g development requirements guidelines and standards to achieve the goals and objectives as outlined in a of this achieve the citys vision for the manchester road corridor the following development standards are established for each class and use within the manchester road corridor it is recognized that not all of the standards may be attainable with particular property or uses therefore the regulations in the mc district are intended to provide flexibility to property owners and developers for many types of development particularly for the class a and b sites as provided for in f of this respect to building height and development density in addition the regulations are meant to provide a certain degree of latitude to the planning and zoning commission and ordinance the board of aldermen to vary from these or other regulations when reviewing site plans in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan and these regulations the degree to which a site plan for development meets or exceeds the design standards set forth in this be considered and will be evaluated when considering site plans for proposed development a developer should be prepared to explain why certain development standards cannot be met or that alternatives serve the same purpose as the standard the standards are intended to allow the manchester road corridor to become another recognized location within the city as a liveworkrelax location examples of the various standards andor design features intended to be carried out within the mc district are included throughout this building design new buildings should be designed to include common features and materials so that a sense of place and character is created for the mc district a exterior building materials building materials should be used and installed in keeping with the chosen architectural style building material colors
