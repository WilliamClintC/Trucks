board believes that by implementing these regulations the character of peterborough will be preserved the property values will be maintained and the community with benefit overall from aesthetically pleasing development b it is the intent that these guidelines shall apply only to commercial development however the board reserves the right to review other nonresidential or multifamily developments under this section as it deems reasonable c general guidelines an application is considered to meet the aesthetic considerations of these regulations if the planning board in its judgment determines that the application overall demonstrates reasonable conformity with the purpose above and the general guidelines that follow following are photographic examples of design elements of buildings located in peterborough offered for consideration by the board 1 recognizing that every property every proposal and every situation is unique the planning board may waive modify or soften any of the standards herein as it reasonably deems appropriate based upon the individual circumstances of any application no particular style is stipulated and innovative contemporary and distinctive designs are encouraged provided they are respectful of general design principles and context 2 it is recognized that many national and regional chain businesses seek to build a standard design across the country or region without regard to local conditions however the planning board will evaluate all proposed designs for their compatibility with our own local community character and for conformance with the purpose of these regulations it shall be the obligation of the applicants to develop designs that are compatible with our community character  the town of peterborough need not make adjustments to accommodate these template designs 3 buildings should be compatible with traditional new england architecture they should be articulated to express an architectural identity will be handsome and dignified and significant enough to be worth saving into the future 4 buildings should possess an overall integrity architectural details should not give the impression of being tacked on but rather should be integral to the overall design for example use of undersized shutters on a picture window or installation of an elaborate classical portico or cupola on an otherwise clearly utilitarian big box would be discouraged 5 the reuse of existing structures that have special architectural historical cultural or contextual value by the applicant is strongly encouraged 6 modifications and additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the character of the existing building when the existing building would reasonably be considered to be in general conformance with the goals

agricultural business enterprise uses on a commercial farm a purpose and intent i agricultural business enterprise uses are intended to diversify a commercial farms offerings and increase opportunities to generate onfarm revenues by encouraging members of the public to visit engage with and utilize the farms resource base the purpose and benefits to the community of allowing these uses include strengthening the economic viability of a farm  strengthening the publics connection to and understanding of local food production  educating the public about the benefits of farming to the community  and strengthening the communitys local economy ii as the additions of these types of uses may have the potential to generate increased impacts that did not previously exist or could not have been anticipated by an existing residential neighbor to the farm it is also in the communitys interest to ensure that any uses permitted are appropriate for the sites they are on and that if permitted the uses and the sites they are on are designed to ensure public safety  protect neighborhood character  avoid any substantial nuisance to the neighbors  and protect the quality of environmental resources as a mechanism to help meet these goals the planning board has the authority to establish reasonable limits to the uses and their size scale number of participants frequency and hours of operation the planning board also has the 2458 town of peterborough 2458 zoning ordinance as of   of 138 authority to establish such reasonable conditions as are necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of the ordinance iii it is the intent of this ordinance that its application be limited to those properties where commercial farming is clearly intended to be the principal use of the property and that the combined scale of all proposed agricultural business enterprise uses are proportionately less significant than the overall scale of the combined commercial agriculture uses of the property it is intended that these uses are not over time permitted to become standalone uses or principal uses in relation to a commercial agriculture operation to accomplish these goals the planning board shall have latitude in exercising its discretion when evaluating the individual circumstances of each applicant proposal and the characteristics of each site to ensure that all

agricultural business enterprise use into a principal commercial use may not be permitted  ii compatibility the proposed use and site designs are compatible with the general dimensional design and use characteristics of the neighborhood the public or private roads used to access the site and the surrounding area  the property is otherwise reasonably well suited for the proposed use  iii aesthetic character the proposed use will not adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the streetscape or neighborhood  iv nuisances the proposed use and site design will not result in any substantial adverse impacts including but not limited to noise light trespass odors or smoke  or place any undue burden on any abutter  v resources the proposed use will not have a significantly adverse impact upon

agricultural capacity of farmland the proposed use and site shall be designed to protect the future production capacity of farmland and avoid conversion of existing productive farmland or underutilized land with important agricultural soils to uses that would eliminate future production potential of the farmland  d factors to consider in evaluating compliance with general criteria i is commercial agriculture the principal use of the property or will it be so in the reasonably near future in making such a determination consideration may be given to 1 the extent to which the land and structures are currently engaged in productive commercial agriculture use or are to be reclaimed for future productive commercial agriculture use within a reasonable timeframe as compared to other existing or proposed uses of the property  2 evidence of investment human and financial made in maintaining and growing the commercial agriculture business including but not limited to building soils reclaiming or planting fields or orchards building or restoring barns or acquiring and maintaining related equipment and facilities  3 evidence of markets and customers served by the operation  4

agriculture operation as a principal use of a property within a reasonable timeframe ii will the proposed agricultural business enterprise uses be proportionally less significant than the overall scale of the combined commercial agriculture use in making such a determination consideration may be given to 1 the extent to which the proposed uses occupy or utilize less space within structures or land areas than the principal use 2 the expected investment of resources human and financial in the uses on an annual basis as compared to actual investment of resources in the commercial agricultural operation 3 the expected revenue generated by the proposed uses in an average year compared to the annual revenues generated by the commercial agricultural operation iii to what extend do the site characteristics the neighborhood characteristics and the site and use design promote compatibility between the proposed uses and abutting uses avoid or mitigate substantial nuisances to abutting properties and maintain or enhance the rural character of the property and the neighborhood in making such a determination consideration may be given to 1 road width construction and type deadend roads state roads  existing traffic volumes and proposed traffic volumes 2 neighborhood density around site and along access roads to site  3 proximity of abutting residential dwellings to the proposed activitiesuses  4 existing site characteristics topography natural vegetation proximity to surface waterwetlands etc and the likelihood that the natural site characteristics will adequately

hours and the likelihood that they produce unreasonable impacts or nuisances given the above factors  7 overall rural character and how proposed use will impact aesthetic quality of the neighborhood  and 8 proximity of proposed uses to significant or sensitive natural historic scenic or cultural resources and the extent to which the site and uses are designed to prevent avoid or mitigate adverse impacts to these resources iv to what extent does the site design avoid impact to the production capacity of farmland  in making such a determination consideration may be given to 1 relationship and proximity of underutilized farmland that may be impacted to existing productive farmland  2 quality and continuity of the farmland soils and the likelihood that they could reasonably be used for agricultural production  and 3 economics of making necessary improvements to make unused farmland soils productive e burden of persuasion the applicant shall bear the burden of persuasion introduction

while also promoting design creativity 245153 appendices town of peterborough zoning ordinance as of   of 138 front setbacks new homes should continue prevailing building setback patterns in order to reinforce the rhythm and character of the streetscape environment there is quite a bit of variation along residential streets in peterborough and appropriate setbacks may vary from lottolot depending on the streets context setbacks should generally be drawn from neighboring houses on the same side of the street and reinforce the prevailing neighborhood fabric neither pulling back too far from the street nor setting the home too close to the street when spaces between the house and the street become too large the sense of enclosure along the street is lost and it becomes more difficult to provide rear parking or backyard space buildings set closer to the street than the prevailing residential patterns disrupt the rhythm and order of the streetscape and appear intrusive 245153

primary pedestrian entry and other building faade elements toward the street buildings should not turn their backs or sides to the street garages and parking areas should be located to the rear of the lot ideally front facing garage doors would be set a minimum of 20feet behind the front faade of the house and the driveway should be limited to one lane between the street and the front faade if it is not possible to set the garage back 20 feet the planning board may reduce the setback taking into consideration the site conditions and neighborhood context garages may be placed beneath the main floor of the house and turned to the side to reduce the negative visual impact of garage doors facing the street shared driveways are encouraged where appropriate 245153 appendices town of peterborough zoning ordinance as of   of 138 building height and massing the front elevation of a new home should be similar in terms of height and width to other houses along the street buildings should be consistent with the orientation of the main mass of the building and its relationship to the street in many traditional new england neighborhoods the main building mass was oriented perpendicular to the street creating narrow and deep lot and house patterns this building pattern often resulted in the row of repeating gables facing the street that is emblematic of nineteenth century new england townscapes 245153 appendices town of peterborough zoning ordinance as of   of 138 architectural features some neighborhoods have clear recurring architectural features including

peterborough planning board the board shall consist of seven members who shall be elected in accordance with rsa  &  one of the seven is an ex officio representing the board of selectmen the selectmens representative is a full voting member of the planning board b except for the selectmens representative members shall be elected for threeyear terms with no more than three members standing for election in any given year terms of office shall commence at the first regular planning board meeting after the annual town meeting the term of the selectmens representative shall coincide with the term of that office c at its first regular meeting following the annual town meeting the board shall elect from among its members a chairman and a vicechairman these officers shall serve for one year the selectmens representative may not serve as chairman d the board may appoint up to five alternate members for a term of three years each e vacancies in the board other than the selectmens representative shall be filled by the remaining board members until the next regular election at which time a successor shall be elected to either fill the unexpired term or start a new term as appropriate ii duties of officers a the chairman shall preside over meetings and shall be responsible for the conduct and decorum of the meeting the chairman shall ensure that all parties receive a full and fair hearing before the board b whenever the chairman is absent or disqualified to act in a particular case the duties of chairman shall be performed by the vicechairman or another member designated by the board c when feasible the member that serves as chair for an initial application shall continue to serve as chair until the application has been acted on iii meetings a for the purpose of this section a meeting means the convening of a quorum of the board whether in person by means of telephone or electronic communication email or in any other manner such that all participating members are able to communicate with each other contemporaneously for the purpose of discussing or acting upon a matter or matters over which the board has jurisdiction this does not include chance meetings meetings convened by other boards committees or entities at which a quorum of the planning board finds itself present or social meetings provided no board business is discussed nor decisions made 2 1 email board members may use email to schedule and confirm meetings to circulate draft documents that will be presented at public meetings or to correspond with the office of community development regarding working documents agenda items or other administrative business official business1 should not be conducted by email such a discussion would be in violation of the righttoknow law email correspondence may be subject to disclosure as public documents b a quorum of the board is required in order to transact any business four 4 members constitute a quorum of the planning board c regular meetings of the board are held at  pm on the second monday of each month at the town house d in the event a regular member is absent or disqualified the chairman shall designate an alternate to act in the absent members place except that an absent ex officio member can only be replaced by another selectman alternate members voting privileges will be announced at each meeting by the chair alternate members are encouraged to participate in all board meetings e special meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman or by request of a majority of the members special meetings do not require a quorum unless a vote is to be taken special meetings will be posted for 1 informal public input or 2 a planning board workshop 1 the purpose of workshops is for the full board to conduct its work in preparation for presentation to the public or for work groups of members to present to the full board 2 while the public is always welcome to attend input is only by invitation from the chair or the work group since workshops typically do not need to meet the same public notification requirements as a public hearing the board must be careful to not allow undue influence into the process from those that attend workshops over those who only attend the public hearings 3 input can be taken if the work group or board sees fit or it may feel the time allowed for the workshop does not provide adequate time for the group to conduct its work and take public input at the same meeting the public has full voice at public hearings after due notice 4 therefore the general rule of thumb is that the work group or board will conduct its business first and then if time allows open the meeting to public input the members will take the input under advisement and will not engage in debate 1 for the purposes of this document official business means taking votes or engaging in discussions that pertain to formal applications this does not preclude emails between the board and ocd regarding agenda items 3 f notification 1 notice of all special meetings of the omission of any regular meeting and of any change in the time or place of a regular
