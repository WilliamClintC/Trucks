residents with reentry packets which included personal protective equipment and information on the dangerous conditions and toxic materials present in the camp fire area the reentry packets were intended to improve the safety of the residents who chose to visit their properties to collect valuables and not intended to encourage longterm visitation or habitation the purpose of the hazard advisory was to address the public health hazards present at the time in the camp fire area including 1 the enormous amount of fire debris present in the camp fire area  2 the hazardous materials and

fire has created an enormous amount of debris l there exists the potential for widespread toxic exposures and threats to public health and the environment in the aftermath of a major wildfire disaster and debris and ash from residential and commercial structure fires contain hazardous materials and the harmful health effects of hazardous materials produced by a wildfire are welldocumented m the combustion of building materials such as siding roofing tiles and insulation results in dangerous ash that may contain asbestos heavy metals and other hazardous materials household hazardous waste such as paint gasoline cleaning products pesticides compressed gas cylinders and chemicals may have been stored in homes garages or sheds that may have burned in the fire also producing hazardous materials n exposure to hazardous materials may lead to acute and chronic health effects and may cause longterm public health and environmental impacts uncontrolled hazardous materials and debris pose significant threats to public health of dust particles and contamination of drinking water supplies improper handling can expose residents and workers to toxic materials and improper transport and disposal of fire debris can spread hazardous substances throughout the community o standards and removal procedures are needed immediately to protect the public health and environment and to facilitate coordinated and effective mitigation of the risks to the public health and environment from the health hazards generated by the camp fire disaster p the camp fire has created hazardous waste conditions in the town of paradise in the form of contaminated debris from household hazardous wastematerials and structural debris resulting from the destruction of thousands of structures this hazardous waste debris poses a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment until the property is certified clean the accumulated exposure to hazardous waste debris over an extended period of time poses a severe hazard to human health q the town of paradise previously approved as urgency measures relating to the camp fire disaster recovery on  the actions addressed the need for the regulation of debris removal to alleviate the public health safety and welfare concerns associated with the ash and debris of qualifying structures and temporary emergency housing options r as of  the status of the camp fire disaster recovery was as follows 1 phase i cleanup by the us environmental protection agency and the california department of toxic substances control is complete which has reduced the public health concerns relating to the most hazardous materials present in the camp fire area 2 phase ii of the cleanup pursuant to the government caloes program and the alternative program has commenced 3 utilities are available except for potable water 4 numerous businesses have opened to serve the public 5 public services are available including a fema and caloes jointlyoperated disaster recovery center in paradise california current threats include 1 the enormous amount of fire debris present in the camp fire area 2 hazardous materials and probable radioactive materials present in ash and debris from qualifying structures 3 the potential pollution of the drinking water downstream from the camp fire area if weather conditions caused the spread of the hazardous materials in the ash and debris of burned qualifying structures the purpose of this chapter is to allow residents to live on properties in the camp fire area that do not contain fire ash and debris from a qualifying structure destroyed or damaged by the camp fire s the debris removal operations plan for the camp fire prepared by the caloescalrecycle incident management team provides that the dtsc has issued reports regarding the assessment of burn debris from wildfires in the past the studies of burned residential homes and structures from large scale wildland fires indicated that the resulting ash and debris can contain asbestos and toxic concentrated amounts of heavy metals such as antimony arsenic cadmium copper lead and zinc qualifying structures additionally the ash and debris may contain higher concentrations of lead if the home was built prior 1978 when lead was banned from household paint in the united states the reports indicated that the residual ash of burned residential homes and structures has high concentrations of heavy metals that can be toxic and can have significant impact to individual properties local communities and watersheds if the ash and debris is not removed safely and promptly the plan also indicates that the purpose of the structural debris removal program is to remove debris that poses a risk to health andor the environment debris from structures smaller than one hundred twenty 120 square feet are not included in the program t the butte county local health officer dr miller has indicated that the phase ii cleanup of the properties containing ash and debris from a qualifying structure mitigates the public health hazards of the camp fire further failing to clean properties containing ash and debris from a qualifying structure can have severely negative long term consequences to the public health and environment therefore the focus must be on accomplishment of the phase ii cleanup to address the public health hazards the standard for determining when a property is clean from ash and debris from a qualifying structure is when the phase ii cleanup work is complete and the property is certified clean by the county department of public health environmental health division ash and debris of qualifying structures is the focus of the phase ii cleanup work the significance of the public health risks is higher on properties with ash and debris from a qualifying structure given the progress the camp fire disaster recovery has made with respect to the hazards identified in the findings above the remaining significant public health hazard is the ash and debris from qualifying structures based on the foregoing properties that contain ash and debris from qualifying structures constitute a significant public health risk therefore those properties should be ineligible for temporary emergency housing until phase ii cleanup work is completed on the property and is certified clean by the department of public health environmental health division properties that do not contain ash and debris from a qualifying structure do not pose a significant public health risk and should be eligible for temporary emergency housing u due to the magnitude of the destruction there is a need to provide for sufficient housing options both inside and outside of the camp fire affected area thus on  the town of paradise adopted that repealed established an ordinance that temporarily relaxes some building and zoning regulations to allow for additional interim housing both inside and outside of the camp fire affected area for displaced persons v there exists an immediate need to provide accessory buildings to accommodate storage of personal property of persons displaced by the camp fire who own eligible property that has been certified clean pursuant to phase ii requirements by the county department of public health environmental health division this chapter temporarily relaxes some town zoning regulations to allow for establishment of an accessory building on property both inside and outside of the camp fire affected area for the displaced persons for the storage of essential equipment necessary to the recovery from the damages caused by the camp fire due to the magnitude of the destruction and its related and significant impacts on properties there is a need to provide displaced property owners with the option of constructing accessory buildings both inside and outside of the camp fire affected area without first obtaining building permits for primary residences on their properties w it is essential that this chapter become immediately effective 1 to mitigate the harm that could be caused to the public health and safety and to the environment from the improper disturbance removal andor disposal of debris containing hazardous materials and to facilitate the orderly response to the camp fire disaster  2 to allow the fastest possible transition of homeless and displaced residents to interim and longterm shelter  and 3 to allow displaced persons who own eligible property certified clean pursuant to phase ii requirements an option to establish an accessory building on their property to better facilitate and further expedite their property maintenance and storage of essential equipment required to allow for the property rebuild process  5222019   purpose thirteen thousand six hundred ninetysix 13696 homes were destroyed by the camp fire in the town of paradise and surrounding unincorporated areas this disaster has created a need for housing on a scale that cannot be accommodated existing available housing in the town to meet the immediate need for housing the town relaxed some building and zoning regulations in a prior ordinance to allow for additional temporary housing however this additional temporary housing may not be sufficient to meet the large and immediate need this chapter relaxes some building and zoning regulations to allow for additional temporary housing inside the camp fire affected area persons moving back to the area do so at their own risk and should make themselves aware of the health hazards of doing so the chapter allows persons to place temporary housing on an eligible property this chapter also provides an option for affected property owners to establish an accessory building on their eligible property without first obtaining a building permit for a primary residence the purpose of this chapter is to develop reasonable standards that allow persons to move back into the camp fire affected area while a massive debris removal program is implemented and at the same time provide interim shelter as well as an option of an accessory building for property maintenance equipment and rebuild materials

serious social medical and law enforcement problems the illegal use of such substances by persons under eighteen years of age has reached crisis dimensions it is causing serious physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community an impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the educational system increases in nondrug related crime and a threat to the ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and productive adults all to the detriment of the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town the proliferation of the display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores within the town and the distribution of such paraphernalia would intensify and otherwise compound the problem of illegal use of controlled substances within this community a ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be practical the person who displays or distributes would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia the already thinly staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to intolerable added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution a significant number of high school students are eighteen years of age or older it would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth the problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia creates this chapter is a measure which is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the incorporated area of the town  1981

green building standards and referenced standards codes in july of  and they become mandatory at the local level effective  b findings pursuant to california health and safety 5 179587 and 189415 the town of paradise has determined and finds the attached amendments additions andor modifications are needed and are reasonably necessary because of its local climatic geologic and topographical conditions c local conditions local conditions have an adverse effect on the potential for life and property loss making necessary changes and modifications to the 2016 california building standards order to establish and maintain an environment which will provide the community a desirable level of protection 1 climatic conditions 1a on average the town of paradise has an annual rainfall of fiftytwo 52 to fiftyfour 54 inches of rain however in the summer months there is little if any measurable precipitation winter months can be characterized by heavy rains and periodic heavy snowfalls with accumulations above the 1800foot level during the year the temperatures range from the mid 20s to low 100s degrees in the summer months with light to gusty westerly winds these drying winds mixed with the density of vegetation which is dominant throughout the town creates a hazardous fuel condition that can have severe consequences 2 geographical and topographical conditions 2a the town of paradise is located within butte county in northern california it is approximately one hundred 100 miles north of sacramento and within fifteen 15 miles east from the urban community of chico the town of paradise population is approximately twentysix thousand plus 26000+ and is the second largest community in butte county the town encompasses 186 square miles and was incorporated in 1979 prior to incorporation the town was a county mountain community with older construction of light commercial and industrial with a predominant residential character 2b the town of paradise is located one thousand four hundred 1400 to two thousand two hundred feet 2200 above sea level and is bordered by rugged canyons creating somewhat of a triangular shaped area in which the town is situated 2c this environment has natural vegetative growth that is dense both in the canyon areas and throughout the town which presents a challenge and difficulty in fighting and controlling the spread of wildfires the town of paradise has been identified as a very high fire hazard severity zone pursuant to government 5 and 511 which is based upon the climatic topographic and geologic conditions combined with the dense vegetation throughout the town 2d the topography of the town presents problems in delivery of emergency services including fire protection hilly terrain with narrow winding roads with little circulation limited escape routes and limited ingress and egress to access the town prevents rapid access and orderly evacuations there are many miles of both public streets and private roads many of which were built years ago and many of the private roads are substandard in design and access capability due to topography 2e combined with these features all weather surfaces based upon the soil and topographic conditions may not be able to support the imposed loads of fire apparatus and reduced accessibility to emergency response personnel these conditions increase the likelihood of difficulty with approach angles steep slopes and grades and the ability for emergency response personnel to be effective d conclusion local climatic geologic and topographic conditions impact the built environment and necessitate amendments to the california building standards it is found to be reasonably necessary that the state building standards codes be changed or modified to mitigate the effects of the above conditions by the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title furthermore california health and safety 7 requires that the modifications or change be expressly marked and identified as to each finding to which it refers therefore the town of paradise finds that exhibit a below provides the code sections that have been modified pursuant to the ordinance that are building standards as defined in the health and safety the associated referenced conditions or modifications are due to local climatic geologic and topographical considerations exhibit a facts &
