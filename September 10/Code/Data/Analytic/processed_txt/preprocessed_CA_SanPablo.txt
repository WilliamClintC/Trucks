blight within the city which can result in the deterioration of property values business opportunities and the enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding property all to the detriment of the city the city council finds that graffiti is inconsistent with the citys property maintenance goals crime prevention programs and esthetic standards it is a public nuisance which

graffiti on property within the city d abatement of these conditions is in the best interest of the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city because maximum use and enjoyment of

conditions d it is appropriate to require the owner to mitigate partially the tenants hardship since the hardship arises from the owners failure to comply with the law and fulfill a landlords obligations to the landlords tenants e financial hardship arises because the tenant generally needs a large sum of money to relocate often including first and last months rent deposits moving expenses and utility deposits for a new residence lowincome tenants are generally unable to obtain such sums and as a result are at great risk of becoming homeless f the level of payments provided in this chapter is reflective of actual relocation costs likely to be incurred by displaced households g delayed payment of relocation benefits may impose extreme hardship upon tenants who then must themselves obtain the large sums necessary to relocate delayed payment may also require the city to expend city general funds to provide tenants with financial assistance for relocation any

background a of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 201 pub l 11296 codified as 47 usc a generally requires that state and local governments may not deny and shall approve requests to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station federal communications commission regulations interpret this statute and create procedural rules for local review which generally preempt certain subjective landuse regulations limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential deemed granted remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified as 47 usc applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment a applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg cellular wifi satellite microwave backhaul etc 2 legislative findings the city council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under a and other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values the city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with a contained in a section devoted to a will mitigate such potential confusion streamline local review and preserve the citys landuse authority to maximum extent possible 3 intent the city of san pablo intends this section to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health safety and welfare consistent with and subject to federal and california

for all towers and base stations wherever located a substantial change occurs when i the proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the director  or ii the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval  provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height width equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section note the thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive the failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur the thresholds for height increases are cumulative

guidelines are intended to assist designers in understanding the citys goals and objectives for high quality residential development the guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in by providing illustrated examples of desirable and undesirable development applicability the design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects the guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the citys design review process  to encourage the highest quality of design while at the same time provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers the guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval in any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail the design guidelines are formatted into two general categories singlefamily residential and multiplefamily residential twofamily duplex development falls under the guidelines applicable to singlefamily residential each category is further subdivided where applicable into neighborhood planning guidelines and architectural guidelines the guidelines apply to new construction residential additions and remodeling that would significantly affect the exterior appearance of buildings pursuant to design review singlefamily neighborhood planning objective site planning should emphasize development that fits into neighborhoods problem areas singlefamily twofamily and multifamily housing may be built on vacant lots or on combined lots in residential districts figure 1 shows three examples of residential layouts on a hypothetical group of six lots the figure shows problems with each of the layouts including paving over front yards for parking developing accessory structures with no yard setbacks jeopardizing the privacy of neighbors by orienting duplex units to the side yard and orienting corner lot housing to the side street rather than the primary streetwhich weakens the continuity of front yards along the street these problems should be addressed in applications for new residential development or additions where applicable second story sideyard setbacks new singlefamily homes or duplexes or additions to existing houses may be constructed as one or twostory buildings to preserve open space on narrow lots property owners may chose to develop twostory houses however second floors may loom over adjacent houses and second floor side yard windows can intrude on the privacy of neighbors development therefore must be consistent with mandatory second story side yard setbacks and height limits see table 1732b and table 1732c figure 2 with four illustrations of twofloor singlefamily houses on lots varying in width from fifty feet to twentyfive feet shows the effects of the mandated wider second floor setbacks these configurations help to protect the privacy of neighbors in their homes and back yards the wider second story setbacks also help to let sunlight and air reach the ground level between the houses figure 1infill development in singlefamily neighborhoods figure 2  desirable single family houses on varying widths a 50foot wide parcel b 37foot wide parcel c 30foot wide parcel d 25foot wide parcel second story design because most single family housing in san pablo is onestory in height second story development or additions should not be so large as to overwhelm adjacent houses or be out of character with the neighborhood figures 3 show examples of new twostory houses and older homes with second floor additions some are acceptable and some are unacceptable the acceptable examples are consistent with the height and setback standards in table 1732b and table 1732c figure 3  acceptable singlefamily house on wide parcel figure 4  acceptable singlefamily house on corner parcel figure 5  unacceptable singlefamily house second story window orientation second floor windows in r1 and r2 districts should be oriented to the front and rear rather than to the side yard this orientation helps protect the privacy of existing residents living adjacent to new twostory homes or second floor additions particularly on twentyfive feet wide lots figure 6  acceptable singlefamily house with second story addition figure 7  acceptable singlefamily house with second story addition figure 8  acceptable second story addition on singlefamily dwelling figure 9  acceptable second story addition on corner parcel figure 10  preferable second story addition on corner parcel garages garages should have varied setbacks and massing front yard setbacks are twenty feet for housing in the r1 and r2 districts a distance intended to allow for driveway parking that does not intrude onto the sidewalk a small increase in the garage setback in new houses is encouraged to visually diminish the importance of the garage to the front facade of the house recessing the garage will also help to emphasize windows and doorways facing the street see figure 11 figure 11  acceptable twofamily duplex project a garage at the front of a lot should have a single story mass particularly in front of twostory massing see figure 12 figure 12  unacceptable twofamily duplex project figure 13  acceptable one story twofamily duplex project where feasible a garage or carport located at the rear of a parcel or on the rear half of the parcel is encouraged figure 6 porches and doors covered or uncovered porches with front door entries are encouraged they should have sufficient width and depth to be usable for protection from the weather and for sitting outdoors see  porches may intrude into the front yard setback a distance of up to six feet which may introduce better variety of front yards along a street front doors should face the street rather than face the side yard porches should not be enclosed in any way that could create habitable interior living space a porch overhead lattice structure or archway covered path shall be counted as part of allowed parcel coverage secondary residential unit compatibility in addition to the standards in secondary residential units the following guidelines should be applied  secondary units and building additions should match or be compatible with architectural features of the main building such as building scale articulation materials color roof angles and forms types of doors windows and porches  frontfacing windows should align with existing windows  the main door in a secondary unit should face the front yard rather than the side or rear yard unless this orientation is impractical singlefamily architecture approach the city encourages california mission style design although there is no single architectural style required for single family or twofamily housing the focus is on a high quality residential environment neighborhood compatibility new development in existing neighborhoods should incorporate distinctive architectural characteristics of surrounding development such as consistent scale articulation materials color roof angles and forms figure 14 finishedfloor elevation porches bay windows window and door detailing etc as appropriate to the predominant styles in different neighborhoods figure 14  acceptable orientation of residential buildings craftsman bungalow style many older houses in san pablo have features common to the craftsman bungalow style including gableend roofs or hip roofs with shallow pitches and wide eaves often gable end eaves are nested with roofs at the same angle see examples of the four street elevation drawings in figure 2 typically such homes have horizontal wood clapboard or stucco walls and composition shingle roofs early california mission style houses in the early california mission style should employ recessed windows broad eaves for sun protection tile roofs and stucco finishes mixed style newer curvilinear street subdivisions have homes with varied postwar styles roof forms are more complex including mixes of gable end hip and shed mixed roof forms are discouraged wall surfaces may be divided into panels such as stucco framed by roughsawn wood this mixed style would generally only be appropriate in hillside and large lot subdivisions in san pablo monotonous surfaces long uninterrupted exterior walls and roofs should generally be avoided relief from monotonous blank walls may be achieved by the articulation of the building mass landscaping shadow patterns and the varied texture of materials large roof areas may be improved by varied slopes gables hips and dormers although different roof forms and angles should not necessarily occur on the same structure exterior materials exterior materials should be consistently applied and piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided metal or aluminum siding and roofs reflective materials and finishes and unfinished concrete block are to be avoided walls and fences walls and fences are integral parts of house design and the streetscape they should be designed in styles materials and colors to complement the dwelling units that they surround andor to which they are attached contains mandatory requirements for development of walls and fences for residential commercial and industrial projects discretionary residential guidelines are as follows  fences and walls should be compatible with the design of buildings or structures that they surround  fences and walls should be compatible with the design of adjacent fences or walls although walls and fence materials that are prohibited in table 1744c should not be used  for a multifamily project a substantial opaque fence or wall may be developed to a height of six feet along a front property line bordered by a public sidewalk in order to screen private patios from public view it may be required to set such a wall back approximately three feet to accommodate an irrigated planting strip between sidewalk and wall or fence multiplefamily site planning entrances the primary vehicular and pedestrian entrance to a multiplefamily housing project should evoke a positive image and provide a point of orientation special attention should be given to landscaping landscaped decorative walls and paving patterns and treatments parking and drives defines parking requirements for typical land uses and dimensions of parking aisles and stalls the following provides guidelines for the layout of multiplefamily parking lots garages and carports  there are three ways of providing parking in multiplefamily housing projects 1 along parking drives 2 in parking lots or parking courts and 3 in garages and carports in residential buildings projects are discouraged that include long monotonous perimeter parking drives or large undivided parking lots closed garages or carports are preferred where feasible  parking drives along the perimeter of a project isolate the residential project from its surroundings and is to be avoided  covered carports should not be combined with project perimeter walls adjacent to streets carport spaces in parking lots should follow the same layout principles as described for parking lots in commercial design guidelines building orientation small multiplefamily projects occupying at least two adjacent lots are allowed in some zoning districts development may be oriented to a central parking court see figure 15 the rear and side portions of the units however should not intrude on the privacy of existing adjacent development dwelling units should also be oriented to the street to maintain a singlefamily character where applicable figure 15  acceptable multiplefamily parking court for four units open space see open space requirements required private open space should consist of patios or decks at ground level andor balconies at above ground floors the design and orientation of these areas should take advantage of sunlight exposure and be sheltered from wind noise and traffic from adjacent streets or other incompatible uses  private open spaces should be adjacent to primary indoor living spaces  private open spaces should be screened from public view  private balconies porches and patios within multiplefamily housing should be integrated to break up large wall masses offset floor setbacks and add human scale to structures figure 16  required common open space should be conveniently located for the majority of units figure 16  acceptable multiplefamily housing project landscaping see landscaping all areas not covered by structures drives parking or paving patterns and treatments should be appropriately landscaped  a minimum of fifteen percent of a multifamily project shall be set aside in permanent usable and landscaped open space  landscaping should be used to frame soften and enhance the quality of the environment  landscaping should screen undesirable land uses and views provide privacy and sun protection around buildings and in parking lots and help to reduce noise  landscaping should help to break up large parking lots and separate private frontage roads in a project from public streets security multiplefamily projects should be designed to provide security for residents and visitors  parking areas should be well lighted  parking areas should be visible from residential units that use them  projects should have secure open spaces and childrens play areas that are visible from residential units  landscaping should be planted and maintained to discourage intruders from entering a project and to provide views into open space areas multiplefamily architecture approach the city encourages california mission style design although there is no particular architectural style required for multiplefamily residential structures elements of the craftsman bungalow and early california mission style may be applicable however the primary focus is on creation of a high quality residential environment similarity to singlefamily architecture many of the same architectural principles and guidelines discussed under the singlefamily architecture section are also applicable to multiplefamily projects and should be considered in conjunction with the design of multiplefamily projects craftsman bungalow style key elements of the craftsman bungalow style when used for multifamily residential development should include painted horizontal clapboard siding gable end roofs facing the street and roof forms that echo roof forms of adjacent or nearby bungalow style houses and multiplefamily housing this guideline does not apply to flatroofed structures early california mission style key elements of the early california mission style when used for multifamily residential development should include stucco walls recessed windows broad roof overhangs and eaves supported by revealed heavy timbers simple building forms and roof shapes and well landscaped walled courtyards are encouraged while elements such as column capitals and window frames covered with stucco are discouraged monotonous facades long monotonous facades exceeding approximately forty feet in length should be avoided building facades should be broken up to highlight individual dwelling units this can be achieved with facade projections recesses and staggered planes and balconies garage doors and porch entries some projections from the face of a building should extend the full height of the structure two adjacent units should not have identical wall forms colors and rooflines or patterns of windows and doors see figure 16 roof treatment elements such as dormers and cross gables can mitigate the effects of roofs of excessive length secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are much preferable to mansard roofs or segments of pitched roof applied at a structures edge sideyard setbacks multiplefamily housing is subject to the stepped side yard setbacks in structures greater than four stories may require additional setbacks so that they do not dominate the character of a neighborhood entrances to units the use of long monotonous access balconies and corridors that serve five or more units should be avoided instead access points to units should be clustered in groups of four or fewer such as courtyards see figure 17 to the extent possible entrances to individual units should be plainly visible from nearby parking areas distinctive architectural elements and materials are encouraged to highlight entrances stairs simple bold projections of stairways should complement the architectural massing and form of multiplefamily structures stairways should be of smooth stucco plaster or wood with accent trim of complementary colors thin looking open treads and risers and prefabricated stairs are strongly discouraged garages and carports detached garages carports and accessory structures should be designed as integral parts of multiplefamily projects they should be similar in materials color and detail to the principal structures of a development prefabricated metal carports should not be used garage doors garage doors should appear to be set into exterior walls rather than flush with them the design of garage doors should be simple so as not to draw attention to them figure 17  acceptable transition from public to private residential spaces appendix b commercial design guidelines  editors note see guidance on the use of these design guidelines purpose the commercial design guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the citys goals and objectives for high quality commercial development the guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in by providing examples of desirable and undesirable commercial development applicability the design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects the guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the citys design review process  to encourage the highest quality of design while at the same time provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers the applicant should use the guidelines unless the city determines that compliance would result in an unfair or inappropriate burden based upon unique site and project conditions the guidelines apply to new construction and additions to development in the cr regional commercial cmu commercial mixed use and nc neighborhood commercial districts in the city any addition remodeling relocation or construction requiring a building permit within any commercial land use district shall adhere to these guidelines in addition to the commercial design guidelines defined herein guidelines for commercial development in mixeduse overlay districts  may apply site planning context site planning should emphasize development that fits into established commercial districts and neighborhoods  the placement of structures open spaces parking and access should consider the existing built context including the location of potentially incompatible uses major traffic generators significant landscape or paved elements unique site characteristics and particular influences  new structures should be sited to complement but not necessarily mimic the design of existing nearby structures attention should be given to height roof forms orientation of windows and entrances architectural materials and colors  open spaces should be used for specific purposes such as shady seating areas rather than simply left over spaces open spaces should not be created in areas otherwise required as land use buffers or yard setbacks designers should look to maintaining continuity of open space with adjacent parcels where appropriate plazas should be created at prominent locations in larger commercial centers and small courtyards should be created in shopping centers and office complexes pedestrian circulation buildings should be clustered where practical and appropriate to define protected pedestrian areas and clear paths  points of pedestrianvehicular conflict should be minimized  special paving at primary vehicular driveway entries to commercial projects should be considered to create inviting points of arrival and to highlight potential points of conflict between pedestrians and automobiles enhanced paving should not be located in the public rightofway see figure 1  where possible vehicular entrances on side streets should be provided to minimize conflict between vehicles and pedestrians on the primary street  arcades landscaped trellises special paving and other ways to create welldefined pedestrian walkways within commercial projects should be considered  boxed and tubbed plants in clay or wood containers should be considered at entrances to sidewalk stores plazas and courtyards  enhanced paving should be used in walkways across parking lots where appropriate to connect commercial buildings figure 1  special paving at entrances to shopping centers  parking lots in larger commercial centers should be laid out so that pedestrians walk along drive aisles parallel to moving cars rather than across parking aisles and landscape areas see figure 2 figure 2  parking aisles for pedestrians bicycle circulation a bicycle network comprised of both onstreet and offstreet

prevents the rack from being dislodged unless by the use of extreme force or custom design tool to dislodge methods that incorporate recessed bolt heads andor groutedin anchoring are appropriate  racks should be set back a minimum of one and onehalf feet from walls planters etc to provide clearance for access  racks should be provided in convenient welllit locations that provide visual surveillance by occupants of the building the racks are intended to serve if the racks are not readily visible to visitors to a site directional signage to the racks should be provided vehicular circulation parking and circulation layouts should consider possible conflicts between shopping center circulation and adjacent street traffic possible conflicts at service vehicle zones and the importance of clear attractive parking areas for public safety  driveways entering street corner commercial businesses should be located as far as possible from street intersections so that adequate stacking room for entering autos is provided  sixtydegree angled parking in commercial businesses is generally preferable to ninetydegree parking because drivers backing out of ninetydegree spaces may turn in two directions of a also angled parking space lots are often better where recirculation is necessary for drivers to find vacant spaces however more ninetydegree spaces can be accommodated than angled spaces in most parking lot layouts  common driveways that provide vehicular access to more than one site are encouraged typically a shared driveway bisects a common property line  shared parking between adjacent businesses is encouraged an increase in floor area may be allowed where shared parking is demonstrated to be feasible by a study caused to be prepared by the applicant see c shared parking  truck delivery and loading areas in larger commercial projects should be located at the rear of commercial buildings and screened from view with landscaped berms andor durable concrete walls trees and parking trees should be located in and on the perimeter of parking lots  parking for large projects should be located in connected smaller lots and separated by landscaping to reduce the visual impact of parking  landscaping areas shall be designed to serve as runoff infiltration areas and shall incorporate vegetated swales to convey storm water runoff to the stormdrain system where appropriate  trees should be planted where they will help to delineate parking aisles and the edges of parking lots  to create a tree canopy that will shade cars trees should be planted no farther apart than four stalls or about forty feet see figure 3  dense and durable plant materials in parking lots should be protected from vehicular movement by tire blocks in parking stalls raised curbs and planting levels asphalt curbs are strongly discouraged because they break down much more rapidly than concrete curbs figure 3  tree spacing in parking trees may be placed in sixfoot by sixfoot planters at the head of parking stalls when the planters are bordered with concrete curbs and turned in a diamond configuration they will effectively serve as tire stops and will avoid the loss of parking spaces see figure 3  varieties of parking lot trees should be specified that lend themselves to trimming about ten feet above ground and which do not drop fruit or sap that could damage automobile surfaces see list of cityapproved trees walls and fences walls and fences are integral parts of commercial project design and the streetscape they should be designed in styles materials and colors to complement the commercial buildings that they surround andor to which they are attached contains mandatory requirements for development of walls and fences for commercial industrial and residential projects discretionary guidelines are as follows  fences and walls should be compatible with the design of buildings or structures that they surround  a consistent design style for a fence or wall should be used around a property  fences and walls should be compatible with the design of adjacent fences or walls although walls and fence materials that are prohibited in shall not be used  screening of a proposed commercial project from adjacent residential properties shall require a sixfeet high masonry wall in the side yard and rear yard see c1 the wall should be finished both sides with plaster or stucco with landscaping planted adjacent to the wall on the project site the landscape strip adjacent to the wall shall be not less than three feet in width and be irrigated with an automatic irrigation system  depending upon its length a wall may be uniform in its height andor surface treatment however a long visible wall could be segmented with columns offset wall planes or planting pockets see figure 4 figure 4  wall types  vines and climbing plants such as bougainvillea wisteria and grape ivy should be planted adjacent to blank building walls on trellises and adjacent to perimeter walls or fences  low walls andor fences such as a threefoot high solid wall or fence or a transparent fence should be used with dense landscaping to screen parking lots from the street the planting areas adjacent to sidewalks should be no less than three feet wide and no more than three feet high see figure 5 shrubs should be maintained to the same height of approximately three feet to maintain adequate visibility from automobiles landscaping on berms can be used to elevate the effective height of the screen and present an attractive exposure of a project to the public sidewalk and street see figure 5 figure 5  screening of parking behind sidewalks  screening of commercial and industrial operations utilities equipment and outdoor storage is discussed in exterior storage should be confined to portions of a site least visible from public view  any outdoor equipment whether on a roof or on the ground shall be appropriately screened from view the method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the primary structure in terms of material color shape and size  wall screening for outdoor storage in commercial and industrial projects should be six feet in height a wall up to eight feet in height may be required depending upon the items being stored and the visibility of the equipment and the wall from public areas  dumpsters should be stored within a concrete or concrete block wall enclosure with a durable metal or heavy timber gate such enclosures should be located for the convenience of employees and where truck maneuvering will not disrupt vehicular movements see disposal and recycling for dimensional requirements  screening of loading areas is shown in design guidelines preferred site planning for small commercial infill projects portions of the principal roadways in san pablo are bordered by small businesses on narrow lots in some cases storefronts may border the sidewalk with parking behind in other cases stores are located at the rear of parcels with parking in front adjacent to the sidewalk streetfront stores and businesses with parking at the rear of a parcel are strongly preferred because such layouts foster pedestrian shopping along the sidewalk and minimize the exposure of parking lots to the street not all properties lend themselves to this configuration but they may be consolidated with adjacent parcels to allow driveway access to parking in the rear development on larger consolidated parcels and development on corner lots with access to parking from the side street are most feasible examples of preferred acceptable and discouraged examples of commercial development on pairedparcels are illustrated below preferable commercial building at front of parcel see figure 6 commercial infill projects should be designed to strengthen the continuity of the building streetfront and to minimize exposure of required offstreet parking at the front of the parcel attention should be given to screening the parking from any adjacent residential development figure 6  preferred commercial building at front of parcelparking at rear of parcel acceptable commercial building at front and side of parcel see figure 7 commercial infill projects with stores oriented to the front and side of the parcel where parking is partially screened from the street may be acceptable figure 7  acceptable commercial project at frontside of parcelparking at rear and side of parcel discouraged commercial building at rear of parcel see figure 8 commercial infill projects that locate parking at the front of the parcel with buildings behind the parking should screen parking with low landscaped walls and possible berms however parking at the front of lots is strongly discouraged figure 8  discouraged commercial at rear of parcel parking at front of parcel architectural guidelines for commercial buildingscommercial districts commercial development that is subject to the design review process defined in will be evaluated against the guidelines contained in this section commercial storefront design there is no particular architectural style required for projects in the commercial districts the focus of design is for commercial storefront development adjacent to the sidewalk second story development is also allowed and encouraged corner buildings may have a roof or building mass that is greater than adjacent buildings infill commercial development should promote lively pedestrianoriented business districts see figure 9 figure 9  storefronts  storefronts with display windows sheltered by awnings or canopies are intended to stimulate windowshopping window and doorframes should be made of substantial materials such as solid wood or steel but not narrow aluminum frames  the required dimensions of awnings and fixed canopies used for signs are shown in c8 the use of awnings or fixed canopies along a row of contiguous structures should be restricted to covered walkways of the same form color fabrication and mounting location  plexiglas metal and glossy vinyl illuminated awnings are prohibited  infill commercial storefronts should include display windows mounted over an eighteeninch to twentyfourinch high bulkhead a recessed doorway in the middle of the storefront and a fixed canopy or canvas awning mounted at the top of the display windows an awning may be in a fixed or retractable frame see figure 9  designers should consider a variety of materials for storefronts such as tile bulkheads multipaned windows and stucco walls as long as they are durable materials used on the second and succeeding floors of a building should be carried the materials used at the ground floor upper floors may include residential units andor commercial space see use design guidelines  second and succeeding floors for residences or offices may be required to be set back from the front yard property line in order to provide a balcony and reduced exposure to street noise  fixed or sliding security grilles may be used for doors and windows where permitted by applicable building and fire code regulations however grilles shall be located on the interior side of the openings only  corporate franchise imagery such as that used for national franchise businesses is strongly discouraged unless building forms materials signs logos colors and other identifying features are made compatible with the overall design character of the area architectural guidelines for commercial buildingsnc cr and cmu districts architectural styles there is no particular architectural style required for commercial buildings in the cr regional commercial and cmu commercial mixed use districts however designers are encouraged to consider the early california mission style as best represented by the design of san pablo city hall regardless of the architectural style chosen commercial buildings should be designed to fit into their surroundings but not necessarily mimic the design of nearby buildings articulation of large commercial buildings large windowless buildings that give the impression of boxlike commercial warehouse structures are generally unattractive and detract from the overall scale of most buildings the following ways to reduce the appearance of largescale bulky structures particularly on the ground floor should be considered  exterior wall planes should vary in depth andor direction  wall planes should not exceed fifty feet in length without a vertical offset  blank walls should be made more interesting with windows trellises pedestrian arcades or awnings or canopies rich exterior materials and colors eaves and moldings and other architectural features  roof height should vary up to the maximum allowed height  a height increase of up to fifteen feet above the allowed height may be allowed for architectural features such as a building entry or prominent corner building covering up to twenty percent of the building footprint  landscaping and architectural detailing particularly around building entrances should be used to lessen the impact of otherwise bulky buildings building wall surface treatments the different parts of a buildings facade should be articulated by arrangement of facade elements andor a change in materials and color  rich saturated colors are encouraged while a uniform treatment of offwhite is discouraged  darker colored wall treatments on the lower portions of a facade should be considered to establish a base for a building perhaps three feet to four feet in height  stucco wall treatments are encouraged because stucco can be used in a sculptural manner such as a curved parapet or a linear parapet molding while large expanses of blank stucco are discouraged stucco walls can be divided into scaled panels by inscribed grooves reveals stucco is also the most appropriate material for design in the early california mission style which should be considered for commercial multifamily residential and publicsemipublic uses in the city lighting lighting should provide illumination for security and safety while avoiding light intrusion into offsite areas  parking loading shipping and receiving walkways entrances and working areas should be illuminated  light fixtures should be architecturally compatible with the project design  lighting should be adequate for security particularly at entrances but not overly bright  all lighting fixtures shall be shielded to confine light spread to project boundaries architectural guidelines for multifamily infillnc district where longterm demand for housing exceeds demand for commercial space in commercial districts the city will consider proposals for infill multiplefamily development in the commercial districts multiplefamily development in the nc district is allowed by conditional use permit pursuant to table 1734a eligible multiplefamily projects include r3 and r4 projects developed pursuant to standards defined in two examples of acceptable urban infill housing in the nc district are discussed and illustrated below infill is encouraged where it would be closely oriented to the sidewalk and would serve to maintain the continuity of existing or future commercial storefronts on one or both sides of the housing this type of residential development may not be suited to all nc neighborhood commercial districts courtyard apartments to be successful residential development must be protected from adjacent incompatible commercial development and street activity and noise an example of an inwardoriented courtyard housing project is shown in figure 10 see also residential design guidelines figure 15 acceptable multiplefamily parking court for four units which may also provide guidance for infill residential development in commercial districts figure 10  courtyard apartments in commercial districts discretionary guidelines are as follows  the privacy and security of occupants should be protected by a clear transition from public sidewalk to semiprivate entrances and private indoor space windows that look down on the courtyard as shown in figure 10 discourage unwanted visitors in this figure a narrow planter box separates the sidewalk from a wellilluminated pedestrian entry residents may also enter their homes directly from their garages there are no exterior stairwells  units that face the street front should have windows that impart a residential scale consistent with other appropriate nearby development  multiplefamily housing in commercial districts should be consistent with the design of multiplefamily housing in residential districts  however private and common open space may not be feasible except for small balconies in such cases drivewaycourtyards should be designed as attractive usable open space perhaps bordered by planters and paved with decorative tiles designed to withstand the weight of moving vans  flowmay be inhibited because the rear of units in figure 10 abut the side property line with a blank wall anticipating future adjacent development of commercial or residential projects therefore the two units in the middle of the project on each side of the court have only one facade exposed to light and ventilation in this case operable skylights for these units may be appropriate streetfront apartments infill lots in commercial districts may be appropriate for streetfront apartments in contrast to the inwardoriented apartment project shown in figure 10 the streetfront apartment project shown in figure 11 may be appropriate for locations where street traffic is not great figure 11  streetfront apartments in commercial districts discretionary guidelines are discussed below and illustrated in figure 11 above  ground floor apartments may be oriented to the street if front doors are separated from the sidewalk by such measures as lockable gates a narrow landscaping strip of dense shrubs and an elevation change from the sidewalk to the front door as shown in figure 11  to enhance security for residents entrance porches should be well illuminated and visible to passersby  each apartment should have its own entry  buildings should be articulated to emphasize the singleunit apartment variations in setback balconies and rooflines will help to avoid the anonymity of typical apartment blocks appendix c industrial design guidelines  editors note see guidance on the use of these design guidelines purpose the industrial design guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the citys goals and objectives for high quality industrial development the guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in by providing examples of desirable and undesirable industrial development applicability the design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects the guidelines are to be used during the citys design review process  to encourage the highest quality of design while at the same time provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers the guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval in any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail the guidelines apply to new construction and additions to existing development in the m industrial district in the city any addition remodeling relocation or construction requiring a building permit within this industrial land use district shall adhere to these guidelines where applicable site planning context site planning should emphasize controlled site access and clear onsite circulation  service areas located at the sides and rear of buildings  screening of outdoor storage work areas and equipment  clear building entries  and landscaping and open space the placement of structures open spaces parking and access drives should consider the existing built context including the location of potentially incompatible uses major traffic generators significant landscape or paved elements unique site characteristics and particular influences industrial parks for larger sites comprehensively planned industrial parks should be developed with grouped buildings and parking varied setbacks although no building setbacks are required in the m industrial district building setbacks should be in proportion to the scale of the structure and in consideration of existing development adjacent to it larger structures may require a greater setback to achieve a proper balance of buildings to landscaped open space and to protect adjacent properties from disturbance site planning examples figures 1 2 and 3 show examples of hypothetical industrial development projects on a typical parcel the illustrations incorporate guidelines discussed in this section acceptable industry layout figure 1 shows a development plan for a single manufacturing business the building is set back from the street behind visitor parking employee parking is on the side loading is at the rear a threefoot wide planting strip borders the site the building is set off with landscaping around its perimeter and exterior walls are offset to break down the scale of the building the site plan is acceptable except for the undesirable parking at the front of the site discouraged industry layout figure 2 shows a development plan for a single manufacturing business the building is set back from the street behind the loading area and parking is oriented to the side a threefoot wide planting strip borders a sixfoot high fencewall around one side and the rear of the site the building is set off with landscaping along one side only exterior walls are articulated to break down the scale of the building the main entry is made prominent the site plan is discouraged because it places loading at the front of the parcel preferred business layout figure 3 shows a development plan for three businesses such as fabrication contracting and distribution the front of the building is set back from the sidewalk to allow for landscaping the front entry and side entries are articulated landscaping is located adjacent to the building between the entries each business has direct access to paved areas at the rear and nonentry side of the building one of the driveways is shared with an adjacent property figure 1  acceptable industry layout figure 2  discouraged industry layout figure 3  preferred business layout parking and circulation parking and circulation layouts should consider possible conflicts between project circulation and adjacent street traffic possible conflicts at loading zones and the importance of clear attractive parking areas for public safety visibility of parked cars parking lots and parked cars should not be the dominant visual elements of an industrial site as it appears to be for figure 2 large expansive paved areas located between the street and buildings are to be avoided in favor of smaller multiple lots separated by landscaping and buildings visitor parking at the front of an industrial site is not desirable and should be screened from view walking within parking lots should be designed so that pedestrians walk along drive aisles parallel to moving cars rather than cross parking aisles and landscaping areas see illustration in commercial design guidelines angled parking angled parking is encouraged for larger parking lots that can accommodate oneway aisles figure 1 could operate with a oneway loop with angled parking carpedestrian conflict circulation routes should be designed to avoid potential conflicts with pedestrians shared driveways common driveways that provide vehicular access to more than one site are encouraged typically a shared driveway bisects a common property line as shown in figure 3 internal vehicular circulation vehicles should not be required to enter the street in order to move from one building to another on the same site as possible in the figure 1 layout loading facilities loading at rear to avoid views of often unsightly and noisy loading operations loading for industrial uses should not be located at the front of buildings where it is difficult to adequately screen them from view such facilities are more appropriate at the rear or the side where special screening may not be required see figure 1 loading at front where it is not possible to locate loading facilities behind the building the loading area must be screened from the street see figure 2 landscaping and screening where industrial uses are adjacent to nonindustrial uses or parking appropriate buffering techniques such as setbacks screening and landscaping should be provided to mitigate impacts of industrial operations see also trees and parking commercial design guidelines applicable to industrial development perimeter screening screening of a proposed industrial project from existing neighbors may require a sixfoot high masonry wall or durable wooden fence on the side yard property line and the rear yard property line a height up to eight feet should be determined by the height of the material or industrial activity that requires screening  a masonry wall should be finished on both sides with plaster or stucco with landscaping planted adjacent to the wall on the project site  the landscape strip adjacent to the wall shall be not less than three feet in width see figures 1 2 and 3 and must be irrigated with an automatic irrigation system the landscaping should be protected by tire blocks  depending upon its length a wall may be uniform in its height andor surface treatment however a long visible wall could be segmented with columns or pilasters offset wall planes or planting pockets figure 4 commercial design guidelines screening of industry and storage equipment and outdoor storage should be screened where it is visible from public view  screening should use the most appropriate materials including solid wood fencing masonry walls and landscaping merchandise shall not be displayed sold or stored outside with the exception of exterior construction materials public utilities equipment and similar materials pursuant to a use permit  any outdoor equipment whether on a roof or on the ground shall be appropriately screened from view the method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the primary structure in terms of material color shape and size  wall or fence screening for outdoor storage should be six feet in height a wall up to eight feet in height may be acceptable depending upon the items being stored and the visibility of the equipment and the wall from public areas  exterior storage should be confined to portions of a site least visible from public view parking adjacent to sidewalk parking lots adjacent to and visible from public streets are discouraged they must be adequately screened from view by a low wall or hedge berms changes in elevation and landscaping or combinations of these elements where appropriate see figure 1  low walls andor fences should be used with landscaping to screen parking lots from the street the planting areas adjacent to sidewalks should be no less than three feet wide and no more than three feet high see figure 5 screening of parking behind sidewalks commercial design guidelines shrubs should be trimmed to a height of approximately three feet to maintain adequate visibility from automobiles  landscaping on berms can be used to elevate the effective height of the screening and present an attractive exposure of a project to the public sidewalk and street see discussion of walls and fences applicable to commercial and other projects landscaping islands bare ground is discouraged and should be paved or landscaped structures should be located on landscaped islands where the office portion of a building does not directly abut paved parking areas  a minimum five to tenfoot landscape strip should be provided between parking areas and the office portion of the structure landscaping is recommended around the base of buildings to soften the edge between the parking lot and the structure as appropriate to the type of industry proposed see figure 1 buildings adjacent to streets long windowless industrial buildings paralleling rumrill blvd and giant road should be avoided industrial buildings should be oriented perpendicular to these major streets allowing for a pedestrian entry at the front of the building to the sidewalk see figure 3 screening of loading areas landscaped berms should be considered to screen loading docks and dumpsters from public areas see figure 4 figure 4  elevation changes to screen loading and other operations architectural design guidelines industrial development that is subject to the design review process defined in will be evaluated against the guidelines contained in this section there is no particular architectural style required for industrial projects the focus of design should be on building entrances durable and attractive exterior materials and avoidance of long uninterrupted blank walls large buildings large buildings that give the impression of boxlike structures are generally unattractive and detract from the overall design of most buildings the following ways should be considered to reduce the appearance of large scale bulky structures particularly on the ground floor  roof height should vary up to the maximum allowed height  a height increase of up to fifteen feet above the allowed height shall be allowed for architectural features particularly building entrances covering up to 20% of the building footprint see figure 2  exterior wall planes should vary in depth andor direction wall planes should not exceed fifty feet in length without a vertical offset rooflines should not maintain the same height for more than fifty feet without offsetting the roofline or interrupting it see figure 1  the upper portion of an exterior wall should end with a capped parapet molding or roof eave mansard roofs and mansard roof eaves are strongly discouraged  blank front and side wall elevations on street frontages should be avoided  blank walls should be made more interesting with windows textured or incised wall materials and bands of varying color and materials stucco wall treatments are encouraged because stucco can be used in a sculptural manner such as a curved parapet or a linear parapet molding stucco walls can be divided into scaled panels by inscribed grooves reveals  windows and doors flush to the exterior wall of the building are discouraged unless awnings or canopies over the windows are used entrance projections trellises with vine landscaping window awnings or canopies and other architectural projections should be considered at entrances depending upon the nature of the proposed industry lighting lighting should provide illumination for security and safety while avoiding light intrusion into offsite areas  parking loading shipping and receiving walkways

relocation or construction requiring a building permit within the affected land use district shall adhere to these guidelines where applicable adjustment to sign area maximum sign areas for various types of signs are summarized in within the limits of the maximum sign area adjustments should be made to improve the readability of wall signs without using unnecessarily large letters typically words with letters from ten inches to twentyfour inches in height will be readily readable as seen from perimeter sidewalks and from vehicles being driven at moderate speed eg twentyfive mph to thirty mph on adjacent roadways at some locations six inch high letters will be satisfactory the choice of appropriate signs should consider the heights of lettering the locations and sizes of existing signs on adjacent businesses the height of building walls to which signs are mounted architectural designs of buildings colors and other factors described in title 18 signs discouraged signs business center sign directories freestanding project identification signs located near vehicular entrances to shopping centers are discouraged if they include directories of tenants frequently such signs include multiple tenant names and corporate logos that can be difficult to decipher from a moving vehicle on an adjacent roadway see figure 1 it is preferable to have a pylonmounted sign or monument sign with the name of the shopping or business center alone and the names of tenants mounted on the walls of the businesses they represent further very large signs and billboards as shown in figure 1 are strongly discouraged figure 1  unacceptable business center tenant signs proliferation of signs on one property even though a property may comply with the maximum overall sign area allowed by multiple small signs and logos are discouraged and roof signs are prohibited see figure 2 figure 2  unacceptable multiple signs and roof signs signboards framed signboards or internally illuminated box signs also known as cabinet signs that are mounted on the front walls of businesses are prohibited signs comprised of individually mounted letters are encouraged encouraged signs monument signs monument signs are preferred to pylonmounted signs for most project identification situations a monument sign can be integrated into landscaped areas with terrace walls and berms that screen parking unlike freestanding pylonmounted signs see figure 3 a monument sign can also be placed alongside a driveway entrance to a project or in the median of an entrance driveway see figure 1 in the commercial design guidelines figure 3  acceptable monument signs streetfront signs streetfront businesses should emphasize pedestrianoriented signs such as projecting signs awning valance signs and blade signs hung beneath covered walkways see figure 4 figure 4  acceptable pedestrianoriented storefront signs wall signs aligned signs mounted on the front walls of businesses should be aligned with wall signs on adjacent businesses if the businesses share the same wall plane wall signs should not crowd the top of wall or parapet planned sign programs are encouraged to ensure that signage is consistent
