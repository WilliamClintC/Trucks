secondhand smoke which contains 4000 chemicals 63 of which cause cancer is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states and the national cancer institute determined in 2000 monograph #10 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of as many as 65000 americans annually b numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease strokes respiratory disease and lung cancer c the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen us dhhs 200 citing cal epa 1997 d the ills of smoking and secondhand smoke are well documented in all of the independent medical studies and secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease e children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma respiratory infections sudden death syndrome development abnormalities and cancer f the americans with disabilities act which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability g 1 the us surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke  2 the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation  3 air cleaners which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke  4 american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments because it cannot determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke which contains cancercausing chemicals and ashrae acknowledges that the technology does not exist that can remove from the air chemicals that cause cancer h a recently promulgated ashrae position document on environmental tobacco smoke concludes that at present the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban all smoking activity i the ashrae position document further concludes that no current ventilation air cleaning or other technologies have been demonstrated to control health risks from environmental tobacco smoke exposure in spaces where smoking occurs 442 j a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace and employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer a 25% to 50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and a measurable decrease in lung function k smokefilled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke l numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree m creation of smokefree

such trees with trees equal in diameter measured 12 from the base if the tree which is lost is 6 or less in diameter provided such trees are commercially available if any such tree is greater than 6 in diameter or otherwise is not commercially available then the developer must replace any such lost tree with trees with a minimum diameter of five inches and equaling in number the figure reached by dividing the diameter of the tree which is lost by five and rounded up if it results in a fraction of 5 or above and down if it results in a fraction less than 5 eg if a 15 tree is lost it would have to be replaced with 3 trees with each to have a minimum diameter of 5 or better with all diameters to be measured 12 above the ground landscaping design requirements ix 11 e as set forth above there will be instances when the developer is required to replace trees during the twoyear maintenance period and as a result the village will be afforded less than two years to monitor the health and vigor

listed as a permitted use or otherwise made allowable by special or conditional use permit within the zoning district in which it is located is considered nonconforming as to use nonconforming uses can exist in buildings or structures designed or intended for such nonconforming use alternatively they can exist in buildings or structures not designed for such uses but rather in buildings or structures intended for uses permitted in the applicable zoning district it is the intent of these provisions to distinguish between those two types of use nonconformance 2 nonconformance as to bulk a building or structure conforming in terms of use but not meeting the standards established for bulk and yard requirements in the zoning district in which they are located represent nonconformance as to bulk this can occur in one of two ways it either complied with the bulk regulations of the village when constructed but those regulations have been subsequently amended in a manner causing the nonconformance or it was located in an unincorporated area and complied with nonconforming buildings structures and uses xii 2 all county bulk regulations and since then was annexed to the village which had different bulk regulations causing the nonconformance it is the intent of these provisions to keep this type of nonconformance from further divergence from the bulk regulations established

of this to provide a mechanism to accommodate development of an area of the minimum size established in specific district regulations set forth in this is in the administration xiii 16 public interest and which would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this is anticipated that planned unit developments will offer one or more of the following advantages designs which reflect the historic open character of single family areas of the village designs which enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving streams areas of natural beauty and natural green spaces designs which counteract possible urban monotony and congestion in streets designs which promote compatible architecture between adjacent buildings and structures and designs which will substantially buffer and provide appropriate transitions between differing types of land use and intensities of development from each other so as to minimize any adverse impact which new development may have on existing or zoned development these provisions are also intended to provide an opportunity to accommodate developments that involve one or more uses and that may be located in more than one zoning district in general the planned unit development provisions of this intended to provide the following a a choice in the type of environment available to the public by allowing development that would not be possible under the strict application of other sections of this development andor permanent reservation of open space recreational areas and facilities c a land use plan which permits preservation of green space natural vegetation topographic and geological features and historic resources d a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities which results in better urban design higher quality construction and the provision of aesthetic amenities e the efficient use of land so as to promote economies in the provision of utilities streets schools public grounds and buildings and other facilities f innovations in development so that the growing needs and demands of the population may be met by a greater variety in type design and layout of buildings and structures and by

development is located g a land use which promotes the public health safety comfort morals and welfare the planned unit development requirements and regulations allow for far more flexibility than
