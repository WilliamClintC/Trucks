arise between individuals or neighbors or groups or between developers and neighbors the town of carrboro and its employees or elected officials are sometimes called upon to resolve such conflicts action eg the adoption enforcement or amendment of an ordinance or the issuance or denial of a land use permit  and 2 the interests of the parties to such conflicts or disputes may be more satisfactorily addressed if such conflicts or disputes are resolved by the parties themselves with the assistance of a facilitator or mediator rather than by official action by the town  and 3 it is in the towns interest to establish a policy for referring certain disputes to the dispute settlement center b statement of principles the purpose and intent of the policy set forth herein is captured in the following statement of principles 1 mediation is a process of resolving disputes with the aid of a neutral third person called a mediator who helps to fashion agreements between parties in dispute mediation and collaboration problem solving emphasize the possibility and desirability of winwin solutions 2 the town of carrboro believes that the process of mediation can be effective in resolving disputes involving town government and in nurturing and restoring community among its citizens promoting a process for mediation and collaboration can diminish polarization and engender a better knowledge and understanding between diverse individuals or groups of individuals it can also achieve a better 310 explanation discovery and understanding of the needs and values of differing points of view as well as lead to the resolution of disputes and conflicts finally institutionalizing ways for dispute resolution can lead to a climate of caring trust and more teamwork among citizens and foster an atmosphere of cooperation and connectedness that helps citizens deal with each other humanely with respect to differences and not as opponents in a contest 3 the towns support of a deliberative process of mediation does not mean that people cannot or should not have differing opinions or beliefs an aspect of a process of mediation is creating a safe environment where citizens can express their beliefs opinions and feelings openly and then work to try to reconcile those beliefs opinions and feelings with ones of an opposite point of view the purpose of such a process is not to abolish conflict but to achieve constructive outcomes from conflict c referral by board the board may refer to the dispute settlement center dsc any conflict or dispute whenever it appears that the services of the dsc would be helpful in either resolving the conflict or at least clarifying or narrowing the areas of controversy when a dispute arises in the context of an application for a land use permit or other action that the town is required to take upon the request of an applicant then such referral may only take place with the consent of the applicant d referral by town manager the town manager is authorized to refer to the dsc disputes or conflicts under the following circumstances 1 the dispute is between two individuals or a small and identifiable group of individuals  and 2 the manager concludes that official town action to resolve the conflict is not warranted either because i no ordinance covers the matter at issue and the manager would not recommend adopting or amending an ordinance to deal with the situation or ii an ordinance covers the matter but the manager does not believe that the town should use its resources to enforce the ordinance under the circumstances presented  and 3 the dispute is one for which dsc will provide mediation services without charge to the parties or the town e deferral of action pending mediation once a referral is made under this policy then the town may defer taking any further action until the mediation or facilitation process is concluded f the manager shall negotiate and return to the board for its approval an agreement with dsc covering its services under this policy among other matters the agreement shall cover 1 the establishment of a referral form that would notify dsc and the town that a dispute has been referred to dsc 311 2 the costs of dscs services and a mechanism for assuring that such costs do not exceed any appropriation made pursuant to this policy arts committee established amend     a there

if constructed in accordance with the application and plans will comply with the drainage and stormwater management requirements set forth in  of this chapter so long as 1 the application contains sufficient information to explain how the development will address drainage and stormwater management issues and it appears reasonably likely to the permit issuing authority that the proposed drainage and stormwater management systems will function in such a manner that the development will comply with   and 2 before construction plans are approved such plans must demonstrate that all the requirements of related appendices will be satisfied amended   d the presumption established by this chapter is that all of the information set forth in appendix a is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section however it is recognized that each development is unique and therefore the permitissuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular case for applications submitted to the board of aldermen or board of adjustment the applicant may rely in art iv permits and final plat approval  the first instance on the recommendations of the administrator as to whether more or less information than that set forth in appendix a should be submitted e the administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms instructional sheets checklists or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted in classes of cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the administrator to determine compliance with this chapter such as applications for zoning permits to construct singlefamily houses or duplexes or applications for sign permits the administrator shall develop standard forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information site planning procedures for major subdivisions amended  a before submitting an application for a conditional or special use permit for a major subdivision the applicant shall comply with the requirements of this section b the applicant shall submit a site analysis plan drawn approximately to scale 1inch   100 feet that contains the following information 1 the name and address of the developer  2 the proposed name and location of the subdivision 3 the approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision  4 topographic lines based on maps published by the us geological survey  and 5 the location of all primary and secondary conservation areas as defined in subsections 15198b4 and 5 6 the location of any existing or proposed road connections on adjacent property c after the site analysis plan has been submitted the planning staff shall schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property with the applicant and the applicants site designer designated members of the planning board northern transition advisory committee transportation advisory board environmental advisory board appearance commission and affordable housing advisory commission shall be notified of the date and time of this onsite walkabout the purpose of this visit is to familiarize town officials with the propertys special features and to provide an informal opportunity for an interchange of information as to the developers plans and the towns requirements rewritten  amended  art iv permits and final plat approval  d prior to the submission of a conceptual preliminary plan as described in subsection e the staff shall meet with the developer to discuss how the fourstep approach to designing subdivisions described below could be applied to the subject property this conference may be combined with the onsite walkabout e following completion of the steps described in subsections b c and d the developer shall submit a conceptual preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the fourstep process described in subsection f this plan shall be a preliminarily engineered sketch plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for open space house sites and street alignments this is the stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated before heavy engineering costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout the planning staff shall review this plan and provide comment to the developer on the overall pattern of streets houselots open space and the treatment of primary and secondary conservation areas in light of the applicable requirements of this chapter f each conceptual preliminary plan shall be prepared using the following fourstep design process 1 during the first step all primary and secondary conservation areas are identified and shown on the site analysis plan described in subsection b 2 during the second step potential sites are tentatively located house sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas and 50 feet from secondary conservation areas 3 the third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way and to identify points of existing or proposed connectivity in order to comply with a when lots and access streets are laid out they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on primary and secondary conservation areas to the greatest extent practicable wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly discouraged street connections shall comply with the provisions of 4 the fourth step is to draw in the lot lines g the conceptual preliminary plan shall demonstrate that the proposed development will satisfy the following objectives as more particularly described in the remaining provisions of this chapter art iv permits and final plat approval  1 protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the town for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities 2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating houselots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions the first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands which raise an equal or greater preservation concern ad described in #5 and #8 below the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat 3 if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow 4 maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds 5 designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows minimizes impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive vines also woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10 percent should be avoided however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable location for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal field etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable 6 leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public roadways for example in open agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation art iv permits and final plat approval  7 avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features 8 protects wildlife habitat areas of special species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the state or federal government 9 designs around and preserves sites of historic archaeological or cultural value and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls spring houses barn foundations cellar holes earthworks burial grounds etc 10 protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings stone walls hedgerows etc 11 landscapes common areas such as community greens and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value 12 provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents and adequately screened from nearby houselots 13 includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside footpaths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels where applicable 14 provides open space that is reasonably contiguous and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the design and management handbook for preservation areas produced by the natural lands trust for example fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems as per the policies in the open space and recreation section of the towns staff consultation after

alternative methods of achieving the goal amended   rewritten   amended   amended  a the board of aldermen has established as a policy goal that at least fifteen percent of the housing units within all new residential developments should consist of affordable housing units as described in  that section as well as establish incentives for developers to provide for such affordable housing the purpose of this section is to establish alternative processes whereby developers who do not achieve the 15% objective can nevertheless contribute to the fulfillment of this goal in another way and also to create a process to ensure that developers understand the importance of attempting to meet this goal b an applicant for approval of any residential development containing five or more dwelling units or lots that does not elect to meet the boards 15% affordable housing policy goal by constructing affordable housing units or donating affordable housing lots as those terms are described in  shall nevertheless be considered to have met this goal if such applicant makes a payment to the towns affordable housing special reserve fund in lieu of such construction or donation in an amount calculated as provided in this subsection 1 the number of dwelling units or lots authorized within the development including additional units or lots authorized under when the developer conart iv permits and final plat approval  structs affordable units provides affordable housing lots or is authorized by the board to construct density bonus units by making a payment in lieu of constructing units shall be multiplied by 015 and the product shall be carried to two decimal places rewritten  2 there shall be subtracted from the product derived under subsection b1 of this section i the number of affordable housing units or affordable housing lots the developer proposes to provide under plus ii the number of affordable housing payment in lieu fees the board has agreed to allow to be regarded as the equivalent of providing an affordable housing unit under 4d1 rewritten  3 the product derived under subsection b2 shall be multiplied by the affordable housing payment in lieu fee the result is the amount that must be paid to satisfy the provisions of this subsection b 4 the affordable housing payment in lieu fee shall be an amount established by the board of aldermen and shall be included in the towns miscellaneous fees and charges schedule in establishing the amount of this fee the board may consider i the extent to which the costs incurred by a developer in constructing and selling a two bedroom affordable housing unit including land cost the cost of construction interest cost closing costs and other costs allocable to such unit exceed the maximum amount for which that housing unit could be sold as an affordable housing unit by the developer in accordance with ii the extent to which nonmonetary factors might induce developers to prefer paying a fee in lieu of constructing an affordable housing unit if the monetary cost of doing one or the other were roughly equivalent and iii any other factors the board deems relevant in establishing a fee that provides developers with a practical and financially viable means of satisfying the towns affordable housing policy goals amended    c an applicant for approval of any residential development containing five or more lots restricted to singlefamily residential use which lots the developer intends to sell undeveloped who does not elect to meet the boards 15% affordable housing policy goal by donating affordable housing lots as those terms are described in  or making a payment in lieu as provided in subsection b above shall nevertheless be considered to have met this goal if such applicant chooses to follow the process that reserves lots for purchase by the town of carrboro and makes a payment for the eventual purchase of such lots as outlined in this subsection 1 the developer shall request that a condition that obligates the developer to comply with the provisions of this subsection be added to the special or conditional use permit that authorizes the subdivision in question and such condition shall be added by the permit issuing authority art iv permits and final plat approval  2 before the final plat is approved the developer shall designate on the plat a number of lots that are reserved for purchase by the town of carrboro the number of lots so reserved shall be equal to the product of the number of lots within such subdivision multiplied by 015 rounded down to the nearest whole number 3 the purchase price for each reserved lot shall be the estimated market price as agreed upon by the town and the developer which price shall be specified in the condition added to the special or conditional use permit 4 the lots so designated shall be restricted by the permit to the development of affordable housing as defined in of this chapter 5 the lots so designated shall be in all other ways equal to the market rate lots and shall be provided with utility connections and other necessary infrastructure so as to render them buildable at the time of sale 6 with respect to all other lots within the subdivision no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any dwelling unit constructed on such lots unless and until a payment is made to the town in an amount determined as follows a prior to approval of the permit for such subdivision the applicant for the permit shall estimate the total market value of all developed lots ie lots with houses completed on them within the subdivision that are not restricted to affordable housing units and calculate from this number the percentage number that when applied to the total market value of such developed lots would yield the number of dollars necessary to purchase the lots within the subdivision that are restricted to affordable housing use b if the town accepts the percentage number derived above as a reasonable estimate such percentage shall be included as part of the condition on the permit prohibiting the issuance of a certificate of occupancy until a payment is made to the town as provided in this subsection c the amount of the payment shall be determined by applying the percentage determined in accordance with this subsection to the appraised value of the completed house and lot as determined by a licensed appraiser 7 the funds so received shall be held and reserved for the purchase of the lots designated to be developed with affordable housing art iv permits and final plat approval  8 the town shall have the right to purchase the designated lots at any time after final plat approval and must purchase the lots not later than ninety days after sufficient funds to do so have been received by the town from the other lots 9 if sufficient funds have not been received by the town to purchase one or more of the affordable housing lots after the last certificate of occupancy is issued for the other lots within the subdivision then the town shall either purchase such affordable housing lot or lots using such funds as may be available to the town within ninety days after the date of issuance of such certificate of occupancy or the condition limiting the use of such designated lot or lots to affordable housing shall be deemed to have expired and such designated lot or lots may thereafter be conveyed without this restriction 10 if the funds received exceed the amount necessary to purchase the lots that have been reserved then such funds shall be retained in the fund and used for other purposes authorized for that fund d the board finds that some developers may not fully understand how the affordable housing provisions of this chapter operate or the incentives that are available under the ordinance to encourage affordable housing therefore the board concludes that when developers of proposed developments containing five or more dwelling units propose to construct such developments without meeting the affordable housing goals established by the town for new developments it may be beneficial to both the developers and the town for the board and such developers to have an opportunity prior to the formal consideration of a permit request to discuss the towns affordable housing policy the affordable housing opportunities and incentives provided by this chapter and any questions or concerns such developers may have about utilizing those provisions subsections e and f below provide for that opportunity e the applicant for any residential development containing five or more lots or dwelling units and therefore required to obtain either a special use permit from the board of adjustment or a conditional user permit from the board of aldermen shall be required to participate in an affordable housing review meeting with the board of aldermen if the residential development does not meet the boards affordable housing goal in any of the ways described in this section or  f should an applicant for any residential development containing five or more lots or dwelling units decide in the course of the development review process to change the application in such a way that it no longer satisfies the boards affordable housing policy goal further review of the project will be delayed until the applicant participates in an affordable housing

a period in which the operation of the order is stayed under subsection d reserved page #1 article viii nonconforming situations definitions unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article 1 dimensional nonconformity a nonconforming situation that occurs when the height size or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located 2 effective date of this chapter whenever this article refers to the effective date of this chapter the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this chapter if the amendment rather than this chapter as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation 3 expenditure a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation the term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position 4 nonconforming lot a lot existing at the effective date of this chapter and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located 5 nonconforming project any structure development or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this chapter and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned 6 nonconforming sign a sign see for definition that on the effective date of this chapter does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this chapter particularly signs 7 nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this chapter an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements because structures exceed maximum height limitations because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as density and setback requirements is not in conformity with this art viii  nonconforming situations page #2 chapter because signs do not meet the requirements of of this chapter or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this chapter 8 nonconforming use a nonconforming use that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located for example a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property for example all the activity associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects a nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of nonconforming a when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a duplex that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot b when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements  cannot reasonably be complied with then the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for the proposed use the administrator board of adjustment or board of aldermen may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations  2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety art viii  nonconforming situations page #3 c for purposes of subsection b compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with e subject to the following sentence if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to subsection d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a quarry may be expanded to the boundaries of the art viii  nonconforming situations page #4 lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed at the effective date of this chapter d the volume intensity or frequency of use or property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur e notwithstanding subsection a when one singlefamily detached residence is located on a lot and that residence i constitutes a nonconforming use where it is located or ii is located on a lot that is nonconforming in terms of size or iii is nonconforming with respect to the dimensional or parking requirements of this chapter then such singlefamily residence may be enlarged or replaced with another singlefamily residence of a larger size so long as amended  1 the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to dimensional parking or other requirements  and 2 the enlarged or replacement house does not contain more than three bedrooms or the number of bedrooms of the original house whichever is greater  and 3 the square footage of heated floor space within the enlarged or replacement house does not exceed that of the original house by more than 50% or 500 square feet whichever is greater  and 4 if the original house is replaced the original house is removed from the lot e1 notwithstanding subsection a when more than one singlefamily residences are located on a single lot and such structures i constitute nonconforming uses where they are located or ii are located on a lot that is nonconforming in terms of size or density or iii are nonconforming with respect to the dimensional or parking requirements of this chapter any of such residential structures may be enlarged or replaced with another singlefamily residential structure of a larger size so long as amended  1 the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to dimensional parking or other requirements  and 2 the enlarged or replacement house does not contain more than three bedrooms or the number of bedrooms of the original house whichever is greater  and art viii  nonconforming situations page #5 3 the square footage of heated floor space within the enlarged or replacement house does not exceed that of the original house by more than 50% or 500 square feet whichever is greater  and 4 if the original house is replaced the original house is removed from the lot f notwithstanding subsection a whenever i there exists a lot with one or more structures on it  and ii a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot  and iii the parking requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with if i parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and ii such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional use permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit g a nonconforming use that operates within an enclosed building may expand one time by enlarging the building within which the use is conducted or by expanding within a building where an extension is not otherwise allowed under subsection b so long as amended  1 the area of the enlargement of the nonconforming use does not exceed the maximums established below a if the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use does not exceed 1000 square feet then the maximum expansion shall be equal to 100% of the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use b if the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use is between 1001 and 5000 square feet then the maximum expansion shall be equal to 1000 square feet plus 35% of the difference between the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use and 1000 square feet c if the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use exceeds 5000 square feet then the maximum expansion shall be equal to 2400 square feet plus 25% of the difference between the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use and 5000 square feet however in no case may the gross floor area of the expansion exceed 5000 square feet art viii  nonconforming situations page #6 2 no additional outside storage is associated with the expansion  and 3 the nonconforming use when expanded does not generate noise that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon i uses located outside the immediate space occupied by the nonconforming use if that is one of several located on a lot  or ii uses located on adjacent lots  and 4 at least b level screening is provided in conjunction with the expansion a level screening shall be provided if required under   and 5 the expansion does not involve the addition of any new drivein windows  and 6 a permit authorizing the expansion is issued by the board of adjustment unless the expansion is proposed in connection with a development that otherwise requires a conditional use permit in which case the permit must be issued by the board of aldermen such a permit may be issued only if the board finds that the proposed expansion satisfies the foregoing requirements and that a all of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional dimensional nonconformities including parking nonconformities would thereby be created  and b on balance the benefits to the neighborhood that result from the improvements required under this subsection in conjunction with the expansion of a nonconforming use outweigh the disadvantages inherent in the expansion of a nonconforming use h notwithstanding subsection a an expansion of a building intended to be used for the provision of emergency services use classification  which is nonconforming with respect to setback requirements whereby the expanded building will be no closer than the existing building to the lot line or the street rightofway line or centerline with respect to which the existing building is nonconforming shall not constitute an increase in the extent of nonconformity or a nonconforming situation provided that to take advantage of this provision the permit required for art viii  nonconforming situations page #7 the expansion shall be a conditional use permit notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the table of permissible uses amended  repair maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than twentyfive percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twentyfive percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection 15124e c for purposes of subsections a and b 1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsection a or b by doing such work incrementally 3 the appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser d the administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 no violation of will occur  and 2 the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this chapter applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use or a nonconforming level of residential density amended  compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained art viii  nonconforming situations page #8 or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in the use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning special use or conditional use permit in accordance with may not be made except in accordance with subsection b d however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed amended  b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this chapter applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this chapter is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for that particular use the administrator board of adjustment or board of aldermen issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of   and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if among other reasons compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible however the permitissuing authority may conclude that compliance is not reasonably possible if the cost financial and otherwise of compliance is substantially disproportional to the benefits of eliminating a nonconformity in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created amended  d if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for that particular use administrator board of adjustment or board of aldermen issues a permit art viii  nonconforming situations page #9 authorizing the change the permitissuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this chapter that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning special use or conditional use permit  and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection c of this section are satisfied  and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations amended  a when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of at least twelve consecutive months the property may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes except as provided in subsection b b when a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a consecutive period of at least twelve months then the property may thereafter be reused for a use within the same principal use classification as the most recently discontinued nonconforming use if the permitissuing authority issues a permit authorizing the change as used in this subsection the term permitissuing authority means the board of aldermen if the use proposed would require a conditional use permit in any zoning district where such use is permissible and otherwise means the board of adjustment the permit issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this chapter that 1 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection 15126c are satisfied  and 2 the property where the nonconforming use is proposed to be reinstated is particularly well adapted in terms of the nature and orientation of improvements on that property to that nonconforming use and it would be substantially difficult or impractical to use this property for conforming purposes  and 3 reinstatement of the nonconforming use will not have a substantially adverse effect on the public health or safety or the value use or enjoyment of properties in the immediate area of the nonconforming use  and 4 since the nonconforming use was discontinued the property has not been used for conforming purposes for more than a continuous period of three months art viii  nonconforming situations page #10 c if the principal activity on the property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of at least twelve months then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformity need not be corrected d for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for twelve months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter subject to subsection b e when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter the twelve month period for purposes of this section begins to run at the effective date of this chapter completion of nonconforming projects a all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this chapter as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least twentyfive percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this chapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction b except as provided in subsection a and except to the extent that a developer has a vested right as set forth in 3 all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this chapter and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date the permitissuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the permitissuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations amended    art viii  nonconforming situations page #11 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building zoning sign or special or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective amended  2 except as provided in subdivision b1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this chapter may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of i the total estimated costs of the proposed project and ii the ordinary business practices of the developer 6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him 7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the permitissuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the permitissuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that i at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures art viii  nonconforming situations page #12 8 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the permit issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the permit issuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming amended  c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection b in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 1 8 of subsection b the permit issuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but incompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations amended  d the permitissuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection b that is submitted more than sixty days after the effective date of this chapter the permitissuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year e the administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for tax purposes and developers if different from the owners of all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development this notice shall be sent by certified mail not less than fifteen days before the effective date of this chapter art viii  nonconforming situations page #13 f the permitissuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section these applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of this chapter so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted g when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that the nonconforming project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in stages segments or other discrete units the permitissuing authority shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that nonconforming project repealed   amended  authorization of nonconforming projects amended  whenever an amendment to this chapter becomes effective after an application for a development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued and the effect of the amendment is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect then the permit issuing authority may nevertheless issue the permit even though the project is nonconforming if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on this chapter as it existed prior to the amendment and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if required to comply with this chapter as so amended vested rights site specific development plan amended  a the board determines that a special use permit or a conditional use permit shall be regarded as a site specific development plan under the provisions of gs 160a3851 therefore once a special use permit or conditional use permit has been issued the permit recipient shall have a vested right to complete the development authorized by such permit in accordance with its terms irrespective of subsequent amendments to this chapter to the extent provided in gs 160a3851 b the board further determines that recipients of zoning permits should be entitled to the same protections as recipients of special or conditional use permits therefore subject to b once a zoning permit has been issued the permit recipient shall have a vested right to complete the development authorized by such permit in accordance with its terms irrespective of subsequent amendments to this chapter to the same extent provided in gs 160a3851 for developments authorized by the approval of site specific development plans c a vested right under this section commences upon the issuance of the permit in question and the date of issuance is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of d 1 a zoning right that has been vested as provided in this chapter shall remain vested for a period of two years this vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site specific development plan that are art viii  nonconforming situations page #14 not processed as new applications   see  unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the amendment or modification is approved 2 as provided in gs 160a3851d6 a right which has been vested in accordance with this section shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed d nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of a permit pursuant to the vesting of rights provided for under this section shall be terminated upon such revocation e the effect of this section is to ensure that during the period of vesting the developer is protected from subsequent changes in this ordinance to a greater extent than is authorized under which provides for a vesting of rights only after a building permit has been obtained or which generally provides for a vesting of rights only after the developer has made substantial expenditures in good faith reliance upon this chapter vested rights upon issuance of building permits amended  as provided in gs 160a385 amendments modifications supplements repeal or other changes in the zoning regulations set forth in this chapter or zoning district

three years following the effective date of this chapter or two years after notification whichever is sooner be altered to comply with the provisions of this chapter particularly  or be removed if the nonconformity consists of too many freestanding signs or an excess of total sign area the person responsible for the violation may determine which sign or signs need to be altered or removed by bringing the development into conformity with the provisions of b within nine months after the effective date of this chapter the administrator shall make every reasonable effort to identify all the nonconforming signs within the towns planning jurisdiction he shall then contact the person responsible for each such sign as well as the owner of the property where the nonconforming sign is located if different from the former and inform such person i that the sign is nonconforming ii how it is nonconforming iii what must be done to correct it and by what date and iv the consequences of failure to make the necessary art viii  nonconforming situations page #15 corrections the administrator shall keep complete records of all correspondence communications and other actions taken with respect to such nonconforming signs c this section applies to all signs including offpremises signs nonconforming mobile home communities amended  a existing mobile home communities use classifications  or  that do not meet all of the standards for such a use that are set forth elsewhere in this ordinance at the time of adoption of this section shall be considered nonconforming such uses shall not expand in any way beyond the existing developed areas but shall be allowed to remove and replace the units on spaces existing within the existing community at the time of adoption of this section b only the replacement and location of units on an existing mobile home space shall be permitted provided that the total number of units does not exceed the number existing at the time of adoption of this section  and provided that the existing waste treatment system is functioning properly removal and replacement of such units shall not be considered expansion of the nonconforming use c any mobile home unit replacing an existing mobile home unit on an existing home space pursuant to subsections a and b above and not previously located within the mobile home community must be a class a or class

associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a service station use classification  is permissible in a b3 district  car washes  are not however many service stations have facilities for washing cars if such car washing activities are incidental to the principal use then they may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and a service station with such facilities would be permissible in a b3 district however if the car washing operations are substantial eg if separate from the main building or if there are two or more bays used principally or solely for car washing then the total operation would be considered a combination use consisting of a service station principal use and a car wash principal use this combination use would not be permitted within a b3 district as another example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed as use classification  or  apart from a residential development would require a special use permit or conditional use permit amended  b for purposes of

occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever 1 the change involves a change from one principal use category to another 2 if the original use is a combination use  or planned unit development  the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned unit development use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered 3 if the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned unit development use changes 4 deleted  b a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or viceversa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during with the property may

permissible uses cont 17 combination uses a when a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning special use or conditional use then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be 1 a conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit 2 a special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit but none requires a conditional use permit 3 a zoning permit in all other cases this is indicated in the table of permissible uses by the designation zsc in each of the columns adjacent to the  classification b subject to subsection c when a combination use consists of a residential subdivision and a multifamily development the total density permissible on the developers tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total tract that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot amended  c notwithstanding b whenever i a combination use consists of a standard residential subdivision and a multifamily development and ii the subdivided portion of the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in but that do not exceed an average of 30000 square feet then the density of the portion of the tract developed for multifamily purposes may be increased beyond the permissible density calculated in accordance with subsection b the increase in density shall be determined as follows amended  1 the minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted from each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size and the remainders totaled 2 the sum derived from the calculation in subdivision 1 shall be divided by the minimum lot size requirements fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number 3 the result of the calculation in subdivision 2 shall yield the number of additional multifamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of the tract developed for multifamily purposes art x permissible uses cont 18 d when a residential use is combined with a nonresidential use in a business district the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential use alone for example in a b1 zone if two dwelling units are combined with a retail store in one building the lot must have at least 6000 square feet e when two principal uses are combined the total amount of parking required for the combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for each individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use planned unit developments a in a planned unit development the developer may make use of the land for any purpose authorized in the particular pud zoning district in which the land is located subject to the provisions of this chapter describes the various types of pud zoning districts b within any lot developed as a planned unit development not more than ten percent of the total lot area may be developed for purposes that are permissible only in a b1g b2 or b3 zoning district whichever corresponds to the pud zoning district in question and not more than five percent of the total lot area may be developed for uses permissible only in the m1 zoning district assuming the pud zoning district allows such uses at all c the plans for the proposed planned unit development shall indicate the particular portions of the lot that the developer intends to develop for purposes permissible in a residential district as applicable purposes permissible in a business district as applicable and purposes permissible only in an m1 district as applicable for purposes of determining the substantive regulations that apply to the planned unit development each portion of the lot so designated shall then be treated as if it were a separate district zoned to permit respectively residential business or m1 uses however only one permita planned unit development permitshall be issued for the entire development d the nonresidential portions of any planned unit development may not be occupied until all of the residential portions of the development are completed or their completion is assured by any of the mechanisms provided in to guarantee completion the purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that the planned unit development procedure is not used intentionally or unintentionally to create nonresidential uses in areas generally zoned for residential uses except as part of an integrated and wellplanned primarily residential development more specific use controls whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the table of permissible uses  the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls for example a small doctors office or clinic clearly falls within the  classification office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers art x permissible uses cont 19 or clients to the premises however classification  physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10000 square feet of gross floor area more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling residential uses in conservation districts

located or ii 115% of the median gross annual income of a family of the same size within the metropolitan statistical area where the town of carrboro is located if the unit is one that qualifies as affordable under the 115% exception provided for in subsection c amended   f the developer of the affordable housing unit must establish or provide for arrangements to ensure that for a period of not less than 99 years from the date of initial occupancy of the unit such unit shall remain affordable as provided in subsection c and shall be offered for sale or rent only to families that satisfy the income criteria set forth in subsection e such arrangements may include but shall not be limited to a ground lease a deed restriction or other covenant running with the unit the documents establishing such arrangements shall be reviewed and approved by the town of carrboro prior to final plat approval if the units are located on subdivided lots or prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy if the units are not located on unsubdivided lots the provisions of this subsection shall be considered satisfied if units are transferred to the orange community housing and land trust at or below art xii density and dimensional regulations page #10 a price that is consistent with the provisions of subsection c above amended  g notwithstanding the other provisions of this section if a dwelling unit is transferred to the orange community housing and land trust or other nonprofit housing provider in order to qualify such unit as affordable under the provisions of this section and the financial institution that provides a loan to the buyer requires that such loan be secured by a deed of trust or other instrument that allows the unit to be sold upon default free and clear of the affordability restrictions set forth in this section then the land trust or other nonprofit housing provider may agree to such financing terms should foreclosure under such a deed of trust occur this shall not render nonconforming or otherwise have an adverse effect upon either the affordable unit or the development that created the affordable unit amended  h for purposes of this section an affordable housing lot shall mean a lot that i is designed and approved for the construction of a single family dwelling and ii upon creation of such lot by the recording of a final plat is donated without additional consideration to a nonprofit agency that is in the business of constructing on such lots affordable housing units that meet the affordability criteria set forth in subsections c f above amended  i the maximum residential density permissible within a development whose maximum density would otherwise be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this shall be increased by two dwelling units for every one affordable housing unit constructed within the development up to a maximum of 150% of the density otherwise allowable similarly the maximum number of single family detached residential building lots that could otherwise be created within a development tract under the applicable provisions of this may be increased by two such lots for every one affordable housing lots created within such development up to a maximum of 150% of the maximum density otherwise allowable to illustrate if the maximum density of a tract would be 100 dwelling units or single family lots a developer who chooses to construct 10 affordable housing units or create 10 affordable housing lots as part of the development of that tract would be allowed to construct 10 additional dwelling units or create 10 additional lots that did not satisfy the affordability criteria set forth in subsections c or f for a total density of 120 dwelling units or lots in this illustration the maximum possible density that could be achieved would be 150 dwelling units if the developer constructed at least 25 affordable housing units or created 25 affordable housing lots amended  j for purposes of determining the maximum density permissible within a development under subsection i of this section the board of aldermen may allow the payment of an affordable housing payment in lieu fee determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection 15541b4 to be regarded as the equivalent of providing an affordable housing unit the developer may request such authorization at any time following the submission of a development application in exercising its discretion as to whether such a request should be granted the board shall art xii density and dimensional regulations page #11 consider the need for the particular type of units the payments in lieu would replace the comparative need for cash resources to assist in the provision or maintenance of affordable housing and such other factors as the board deems relevant in determining whether and to what extent payments in lieu would better serve the boards goal of providing and maintaining affordable housing amended   k within any development that provides affordable housing units or affordable housing lots the minimum area that must be set aside as open space to satisfy the

density bonus provisions of this section the permit issuing authority shall ensure by approval of a condition phasing schedule or otherwise that affordable housing units or lots or payments in lieu thereof are actually provided in accordance with the provisions of this section without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permit issuing authority may impose a condition specifying that certificates of occupancy may not be issued for the market priced units until the corresponding affordable housing units are constructed and offered for sale or rent for an amount that is consistent with the definition set forth in this section or payments in lieu thereof have been made to the town amended   n if by using the affordable housing density bonus provided for in this section the number of dwelling units or lots within a development increases to the point where the type of permit required for the project based on the number of units or lots would otherwise change from a zoning to a special use permit or from a special use to a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of the developer may nevertheless seek approval for the project under the permit process that would be applicable if no density bonus was sought under this section amended  o as provided in subsection 15921d developments that use the affordable housing density bonus provisions of this section may be entitled to relief from the setback requirements under some circumstances amended  p notwithstanding the other provisions of this section with respect to a development that i was approved prior to the amendments to this section adopted on  and ii constructed dwelling units that satisfied the affordability criteria by recording covenants and including restrictions in the deeds that conveyed title to the affordable units limiting the sale or resale price of such units in accordance with a formula set forth in this section and iii took advantage of the art xii density and dimensional regulations page #12 density bonus provisions of this section and constructed additional market rate units as authorized by this section 1 the board of aldermen may amend the conditional use permit that authorized such development to provide that those provisions that restrict the price at which the affordable units may be sold shall no longer be binding thereby allowing the units to be sold at market value subject to and in accordance with the following provisions a at the closing on the sale of such units all fees and charges typically paid by the seller of other market rate units such as loans secured by property real estate commissions prorated property taxes excise taxes etc shall be paid by the seller of a unit previously designated as affordable the balance of the proceeds of the sale to which the seller is entitled shall be referred to in this section as the net proceeds of the sale b to the extent that the price paid by the buyer of the unit exceeds the price paid by the seller when the seller purchased the unit the difference between the two figures shall be referred to in this section as the equity appreciation amount to the extent that the net proceeds of the sale are sufficient the seller shall be allowed to keep the first five thousand dollars $500000 of equity appreciation plus an amount of the equity appreciation equal to the amount paid by the seller for additions to the home or significant upgrades to the home routine maintenance repairs or replacements excluded c if the net proceeds of the sale exceed the amount the seller is permitted to retain under the foregoing paragraph the remainder of the net proceeds shall be split evenly between the town and the seller amended  2 the board of aldermen may also amend the conditional use permit that authorized such development to provide that those provisions that restrict the price at which the affordable units may be sold shall expire automatically on the twentieth anniversary of the recording date of the deed conveying the affordable unit to the party owning that unit on the effective date of this subsection thereafter no restrictions on the sales price of such unit or the disposition of sales proceeds shall apply to such unit amended  3 a development wherein affordable units are converted to market rate units under this subsection shall not be regarded as nonconforming

nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the permit issuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that i the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and ii because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards b whenever the permit issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this article pursuant to subsection a the official record of action taken on the development

15 feet in height the board recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of a height maximum for lighting fixtures may result in a development with excessive energy consumption or light fixtures that are incompatible with the scale or style of a development these situations can result in a waste of money that could more desirably be used for valuable development amenities or environmentally useful features therefore the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements and may require shorter light fixtures

which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such street the applicant shall be restricted to using only one street and the closest lot boundary to this street for determining the total permitted sign surface area however the applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine the one street used in the calculations and toward which this sign will also be oriented f the sign surface area of any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed 50% of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located art xvii signs page #9 g whenever a tract located within a b4 zoning

sign allocation may be made affecting by adding sign surface area to or subtracting sign area from any lot after such lot has been conveyed by the subdivider 4 once a sign allocation has been made in accordance with this section the allocation so made shall control the amount of total sign surface area permissible on any lot affected regardless of the street frontage of such lot 5 an allocation under this section shall not affect the provisions of which will continue to govern the determination of the maximum area of a freestanding sign on any subdivided lot freestanding sign surface area a for purposes of this section a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in for example wall signs typically have one side freestanding signs typically have two sides back to back although foursided and other multisided signs are also common b a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed 03 square feet in surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented however in no case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed 50 square feet in

the board recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in g may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of g and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in subsection 15291a in addition that same flexible approach shall be followed with respect to the vehicle storage area requirements set forth in the preceding table a1 the board also recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of bicycle parking standards set forth in h and 152951 may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space in excess of its needs therefore the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of h and 152951 may require more or less bicycle parking subject to the criteria in b1 b without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in g when it finds that 1 a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  art xviii parking page #9 2 a residential development is located on a bus line is located in close proximity to the central business district and is committed to a policy of placing restrictions on the vehicle ownership of its tenants 3 a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade b1 the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the bicycle parking requirements set forth in h when it finds at least one of the following 1 a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly and or persons with disabilities  or 2 a residential or commercial development is located on a lot constrained by size or topography such that the installation of the presumptive number bicycle parking spaces that comply with the design standards for bicycle parking in is impracticable in those cases the development shall instead provide the maximum number of bicycle parking spaces practicable c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in subsections 15291g 15291h and 152951 it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by subsections 15291g and 15291h for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in payment of fee in lieu of providing parking spaces a with respect to properties within the b1c b1g and b2

expected to be constructed within a reasonable time within reasonable proximity to the proposed development and ii the developer pays to the town for each such space that is not constructed a fee in lieu of providing that space in an amount determined as provided in subsection b of this section this fee shall be paid before an occupancy permit is issued to the development unless the permit issuing authority by condition establishes another time b the amount of the fee authorized by this section shall be determined by estimating the cost of providing a paved parking space including land

in this section the number of spaces within the public parking lot so created that are attributable to the portion of the parking lot acquired from each donor lot shall be regarded as still being located on each donor lot for purposes of determining whether each donor lot complies with the parking requirements of this article satellite parking a if the number of offstreet parking spaces

applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking then the developer need only comply with the requirements of to the extent that i parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located and ii satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in however if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available amended  b whenever the neighborhood preservation district commission determines that the number of parking spaces otherwise required by this article for a development within the neighborhood preservation district would render such development incongruous with the special character of the district it may recommend that the permitissuing authority wholly or partially waive such parking requirements upon such recommendation the permitissuing authority may authorize a lesser number of parking spaces than that presumptively required under this

trees part i screening board findings concerning the need for screening requirements the board finds that 1 screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise dust and glare 2 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3 screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4 the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare general screening standards every development shall provide sufficient screening so that 1 neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development  2 the development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads compliance with screening standards a the table set forth in in conjunction with the explanations in concerning the types of screens establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general standards established in however this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered as provided in b the numerical designations contained in the table of screening requirements  are keyed to the table of permissible uses  and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in this table indicates the art xix  screening and trees page #2 type of screening that may be required between two uses where such screening is required only one of the two adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening  the use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the servient use in the other use is the dominant use to determine which of the two adjoining uses is required to install the screening find the use classification number of one of the adjoining uses in the servient column and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in the dominant use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use if the intersecting square contains a letter then the use whose classification number is in the servient column is responsible for installing that level of screening if the intersecting square does not contain a letter then begin the process again starting this time in the servient column with the other adjoining use c if when the analysis described in subsection b is performed the servient use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation subject to all the provisions of of this ordinance d notwithstanding any other provision of this article a multifamily development shall be required at the time of construction to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in regardless of whether in relation to such other uses the multifamily development is the dominant or servient use descriptions of screens the following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth in 1 opaque screen type a a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet an opaque screen is intended to exclude completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation the opaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstruction should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in appendix e 2 semiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque art xix  screening and trees page #3 portion to a height of at least twenty feet the semiopaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces the semiopaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the zone for intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in appendix e 3 broken screen type c a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field

15318 to cover the potential replacement of all such large and rare species trees as are called out in the tree protection plan as being protected the purpose of this security is to ensure that the financial capability will exist during the full five year period described in subsections b and c of section 15318 to replace any large or rare species trees as are called out on a tree protection plan as being protected during construction and which have died due to construction damage caused by a violation of the tree protection plan b it is the intent of this section that the removal and replacement of such trees that die due to construction damage shall be arranged by the town only when the developer cannot be located at the time when the removal and replacement becomes necessary c the required security shall be in the form of an interestbearing account or certificate of deposit payable to the town in the amount necessary for the removal of all of the large and rare species trees as are called out in the tree protection plan as being preserved their replacement as described in subsections b and c of section 15318 and the onetime violation penalty described in section 15114 at the time the security is required at such time as the four year period described in subsections b and c of section 15318 is complete and no deaths of trees called out in the tree protection plan as being preserved have occurred the security and all interest accrued on it shall revert to the developer in the event that some but not all of the security amount is used or needed for tree

of land for a period of up to three years after the completion of a timber harvest if the harvest results in the removal from that tract of all or substantially all of the trees protected by this chapter if the removal of such trees was in willful violation of the requirements of this chapter then such permits may be refused for a period of five years page #1 article xix screening and trees part i screening board findings concerning the need for screening requirements the board finds that 1 screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise dust and glare 2 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3 screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4 the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare general screening standards every development shall provide sufficient screening so that 1 neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development  2 the development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads compliance with screening standards a the table set forth in in conjunction with the explanations in concerning the types of screens establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general standards established in however this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered as provided in b the numerical designations contained in the table of screening requirements  are keyed to the table of permissible uses  and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in this table indicates the art xix  screening and trees page #2 type of screening that may be required between two uses where such screening is required only one of the two adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening  the use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the servient use in the other use is the dominant use to determine which of the two adjoining uses is required to install the screening find the use classification number of one of the adjoining uses in the servient column and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in the dominant use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use if the intersecting square contains a letter then the use whose classification number is in the servient column is responsible for installing that level of screening if the intersecting square does not contain a letter then begin the process again starting this time in the servient column with the other adjoining use c if when the analysis described in subsection b is performed the servient use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation subject to all the provisions of of this ordinance d notwithstanding any other provision of this article a multifamily development shall be required at the time of construction to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in regardless of whether in relation to such other uses the multifamily development is the dominant or servient use descriptions

opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet an opaque screen is intended to exclude completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation the opaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field

completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in appendix e 2 semiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque art xix  screening and

plants appreciably reduce carbon emissions by shading buildings and thereby lowering energy use to cool buildings  and 3 trees shrubs and other plants improve air quality by lowering air temperatures and removing air pollutants  and 4 trees shrubs and other plants transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby maintain the natural hydrologic cycle  and 5 trees shrubs and other plants canopies and root systems intercept precipitation and encourage rain to infiltrate into the soil and maintain soil water for plants and recharge ground water and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control creek protection and flood control  and 6 trees especially large old trees provide invaluable beneficial physical aesthetic historic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land and built environment reducing noise levels and glare shielding people from high winds and

years plus one year in which replacement may occur described in subsections b and c of section 15318 to cover the potential replacement of all such large and rare species trees as are called out in the tree protection plan as being protected the purpose of this security is to ensure that the financial capability will exist during the full five year period described in subsections b and c of section 15318 to replace any large or rare species trees as are called out on a tree protection plan as being protected during construction and which have died due to construction damage caused by a violation of the tree protection plan b it is the intent of this section that the removal and replacement of such trees that die due to construction damage shall be arranged by the town only when the developer cannot be located at the time when the removal and replacement becomes necessary c the required security shall be in the form of an interestbearing account or certificate of deposit payable

should heed the following guidelines a protect trees with fencing and armoring if needed during the entire construction period the fence should enclose an area 115 feet x the diameter inches of the tree to be retained the area inside the fence should be off limits and no work should take place inside the tree preservation zone rewritten  b avoid excavations beneath the crown of the tree as required by b c avoid compaction of the soil around existing trees due to heavy equipment in areas where storage or vehicular access must take place within the tree preservation area outlined above a drivable mulch pad with  plywood on top may be used to protect the trees root system maintaining a minimum distance of 8from the trunk mulch should be maintained at 12 depth preservation fencing should still be placed between the work zone and the trees trunk trunk armoring may be needed when equipment will be used in close proximity to the tree rewritten  d keep fires or other sources of extreme heat well clear of existing trees e damaged roots should be cleanly cut and covered with topsoil to prevent drying if damage to limbs or branches is anticipated in certain locations pruning prior to beginning work may be considered limbs and branches broken during the construction process but still attached should be pruned to prevent further damage an assessment should be performed and corrective pruning may be necessary after construction has been completed around the tree pruning  restoration work should be performed under the supervision of a certified arborist rewritten  f as is stipulated in b no paving or other impermeable ground cover should be placed within the dripline of trees to be retained rewritten  3 e2 standards for street and parking lot trees trees planted in

707 sq feet  based on a crown radius of 15 new or existing trees on the perimeter of the parking lot are credited for having only half a crown over the vehicle accommodation area eg new perimeter trees will be credited for shading 354 sq feet  generally all trees planted in compliance with the screening requirements of the street tree requirements of will be considered perimeter trees when smaller trees such as dogwoods are planted the credited shading area will be adjusted downward to 314 sq feet  for interior trees and 157 sq feet  for perimeter trees based on a crown radius of 10 feet  rewritten  5 when smaller trees such as dogwoods are planted the credited shading area will be adjusted downward to 314 square feet for interior trees and 157 square feet for perimeter trees based on a crown radius of 10 feet 6 e5 guide for planting trees rewritten  the trees recommended in have minimal maintenance requirements however all trees must receive a certain degree of care especially during and immediately after planting in order to protect an investment in new trees the developer and his or her agents should follow these guidelines in accordance with international society of arboriculture isa best practices when planting a all plant material shall conform to the current american standards for nursery stock and must be free from injury insect infestations and disease tree caliper at time of planting should be 23 b the best times for planting are early spring and early fall but may vary depending upon tree species and site conditions these factors must be considered when selecting species and planting schedule trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration and precautions must be taken to ensure establishment c plant all trees at least threeandahalf feet from the end of headin parking spaces in order to prevent damage from car overhang d planting hole should be at least 2x the diameter of the root ball and not deeper than the distance from the bottom of the root ball to the root flair which may be hidden beneath root ball soil excess soil above the root flair should be removed once the tree is in place the tree should be planted so that its root flair is just above existing grade e especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil the sides of the planting hole should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel f after the pit is dug observe subsurface drainage conditions most soils in the carrboro area are poorly drained planting depth where poor drainage exists should be dependent upon the water needs of the tree species if the species is more sensitive to poor drainage the tree should be planted higher than existing grade not to exceed  root of the ball above grade back fill should then be sloped gradually from top of root ball to existing grade gravel placed at the bottom of the hole will not improve drainage g backfill should include a proper mix of soil peat moss and nutrients all roots must be completely covered backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots h staking the tree is not recommended unless necessary to stabilize the tree eg a lose root ball unstable bare root transplant or large evergreen whigher wind resistance staking a tree unnecessarily can reduce the development of structural roots and proper trunk taper if tree is to be 7 staked it should be done so loosely and staking should be removed after the first year guying materials should not girdle or cut into the bark i mulch should be spread at a depth of 23 inches maximum ideally extending to the drip line at a minimum it should cover the entire excavation area in order to retain moisture and help to prevent weeds mulch should not be allowed to touch the trunk as this will cause moisture build up increasing the chance of trunk decay if necessary on sloped locations create a raised ring on the downhill side of the slope to catch rain runoff j trunk wrapping is not required but may be considered for certain species with thin bark in certain locations if wrap is to be used it should be light colored biodegradable paper and be wrapped from the bottom up this will help to prevent moisture build up along the trunk k conscientious postplanting care especially watering pruning and fertilizing is a must for street and parking lot trees minimal pruning should be performed during the first year if at all watering and fertilization rates are dependent upon site conditions 8 9 10 e8 typical broken screens 11 e9 guide for planting shrubs shrubs planted

it is one of the oldest surviving species of trees it is adaptable to any soil climate or degree of exposure to the sun it does quite well in the city it has no pests no diseases and no pruning requirements in sum it is a tree of exceptional vitality the nc department of forest resources calls the ginkgo probably the best all around street tree two reservations are worth stating however first only male trees should be planted because female ginkgos bear a messy malodorous fruit second the ginkgo is a slow grower when young it has a rather gangly appearance it takes 20 to 30 years to assume its mature symmetrically spreading form laurel oak quercus laurifolia height 4060  spread 30+ the laurel oak grows more slowly than the other oaks listed above but it has the advantage of being nearly evergreen in piedmont sections of north carolina it has proven to be a good street tree and does quite well under city conditions it presents no special maintenance problems 21 post oak quercus stellata height 40 to 50 feet  spread 35 to 50 feet post oak is a small to mediumsized tree with a crown that has snarled and twisted branches and found on upland sites with full sun this slowgrowing drought resistant oak typically occupies rocky or sandy ridges and dry woodlands with a variety of soils acorns provide highenergy wildlife food during fall and winter for wild turkey whitetailed deer and squirrels and provide habitat for birds and mammals post oak can be a beautiful shade tree for parks and to stabilize soil on dry sloping stony sites where few other trees will grow it develops an attractive crown with strong horizontal branches scarlet oak quercu coccinea height 6080  spread 40+ this is a third oak which grows rapidly and is easy to maintain the scarlet oak is more difficult to transplant than the red or the willow but it may be a worthwhile selection for its excellent foliage southern catalpa catalpa bignonoides height25 to 40 feet  spread 20 to 30 feet catalpa is a mediumsized tree with spreading branches an irregular crown and generally crooked bole that is suited to moist welldrained soils with full sun the flowers and leaves make this an interesting landscape

feet swamp white oak is a medium sized tree with an irregular crown suitable to river bottomlands depressions swamp borders and along edges of streams it is rapid growing and long lived attaining 300 to 350 years many kinds of wildlife eat the acorns particularly ducks swamp white oak is intermediate in shade tolerance but not very drought tolerant sycamore platanus occidentalis height 70100  spread 60+ the sycamore is probably the fastest growing shade tree on this list within ten years it can grow to a height of between thirty and forty feet it is easily transplanted but it needs plenty of space as one of natures most massive trees sycamores have been known to grow to a height of 170 feet with a trunk 10 feet across the sycamore is a native tree which typically grows in flood plains but it thrives in a variety of situations its tolerance of severe conditions has long made it a favorite choice as a street tree sycamores are susceptible to fungi and leaf blight and their large leaves and seed balls may present a litter problem 22 tulip poplar liriodendron tulipifera  height 60150  spread 3040 very common in eastern woodlands this is a rapidly growing tree with colorful yellow leaves in fall spring flowers however are not very noticeable difficult to transplant except when young excellent street tree white oak quercus alba height 60 to 100 feet  spread50 to 90 feet white oak is found on fertile moist welldrained soils under partial sun acorns are eaten by game birds deer bear and many small mammals pyramidal in youth this species matures into a rugged irregular crown that is wide spreading with a stocky bole while this species is potentially valuable for use in reforestation projects it is not recommended near paved areas willow oak quercus phellos height 6080  spread 30+ this is another rapidly growing oak it has proven to be quite successful as a street and parking lot tree in the carrboro area its slender leaves give it a finer texture than that of other oaks but it still casts excellent shade the willow oak is native to bottomland soils and thus it needs plenty of moisture it often spreads majestically as it matures so it should be given ample room to grow no significant pests or diseases afflict the willow oak 23 e14 small shrubs for evergreen screening amended  the following shrubs are recommended for informal unclipped hedges or screens

made up of two or more substantial improved surfaces with a wide disparity of costs and where one of the surfaces can vary widely in size in relation to the other then for the purpose of estimating recreation points the facility should be artificially subdivided into two facilities one for each improved surface an example of this is the case of a swimming pool and swimming pool patio which have separate recreation point values called out in b 3 determine both the land cost for the facility and the facilitys construction cost in $1985 during years after 198 the construction cost component in $1985 is to be calculated by determining the cost in current years dollars and adjusting it to $1985 using the annual consumer price index figures for years between the current year and 1985 during years after 198 the land cost component in $1985 shall be determined by multiplying the total facility land area defined in 1 above by $075 per square foot add together the land and facility
