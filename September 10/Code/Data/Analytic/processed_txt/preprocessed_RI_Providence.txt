purpose of this chapter is to preserve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of providence and their property and to ensure the sustainability of the employee retirement system of the city of providence for current and retired employees by promoting the sustainability and longevity of the employees retirement system of the city of providence  91715  legislative findings it is the intention of the city council to ensure the sustainability of the employees retirement system of the city of providence and to advance and maintain the longterm stability of said plan in thoroughly reviewing the condition of said plan and assessing the need for comprehensive reform thereof including but not limited to the  report and recommendations of the city council subcommittee on pension sustainability the city council finds and declares the following 1 the city of providence currently faces massive and growing structural budget deficits that are placing enormous strains on the citys finances 2 the citys pension system is severely underfunded with the unfunded liability at or approaching nine hundred million dollars $90000000000 and its everincreasing annual costs are contributing significantly to the citys structural deficits and acute cash shortage 3 the city has funded less than thirtyone 31 percent of its total pension liability substantially below the seventy 70 to eighty 80 percent suggested funding rate for most private businesses and governmental entities currently the citys unfunded pension liability is nine hundred million dollars $90000000000 and the pension plan will not be fully funded for another twentyeight 28 years as a consequence the auditor general of the state of rhode island has labeled the citys pension as one 1 of the highest risk plans in the state of rhode island 4 the annual required contribution the arc for the city pension system and the annual payment for the citys other postemployment benefits opeb including retiree healthcare benefits together total over fifty 50 percent of the citys annual tax levy leaving less than half of the citys tax levy to fund critical and essential city services 5 according to the citys internal auditor the citys projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year has been estimated at between twentythree million dollars $2300000000 to thirty million dollars $3000000000 the projected deficit for the next fiscal year is thirtyone million dollars $3100000000 over the succeeding years the deficit is projected by the internal auditor to grow dramatically to as high as sixtyseven million dollars $6700000000 in 2017 during that same time the arc is projected to grow steadily such that the payment which is over fiftyfive million dollars $5500000000 this year will increase to almost seventyfive million dollars $7500000000 in 2017 the arc will continue to increase each year until it reaches a maximum of two hundred seven million dollars $20700000000 in 203 thereby consuming an ever growing and greater percentage of the citys budget the projected arc assumes an eight and onefourth 814 percent rate of return on the pension investments  if the rate of return is lower the annual projected arc will be even higher and will further deplete the citys finances 6 the citys mounting deficits and pension costs will outpace any income that could be raised by an increase in the citys tax levy according to the citys internal auditor and its outside fiscal adviser gary sasse if the city increased its tax levy for fiscal year 2014 to the maximum extent permitted by law four 4 percent the resulting revenue of thirteen million dollars $1300000000 would be less than onethird  13  of what would be needed to close the projected structural deficit of fifty million dollars $5000000000 further the increased arc for 2014 would consume twentyfive 25 percent of the increased tax levy leaving only seventyfive 75 percent of the increase to fund the deficit and other needs 7 the annual percentage limits on additional tax revenue and the everincreasing arc prevent the city from making any capital improvements such as school improvements or purchasing new equipment further simply raising taxes each year to fund an everincreasing arc would prevent the city from attracting new business and citizens that would in turn grow the tax base finally if left unaddressed the persistent structural deficits unfunded pension and opeb liabilities and the everincreasing arc will ultimately result in the city running out of cash to pay its bills and leaving it with little choice other than to terminate employees close schools eliminate fire stations deny even the most basic services to its citizens and ultimately file for bankruptcy 8 the city has already implemented a number of costsavings and revenue generating steps towards closing its structural budget deficits and making its pension system more sustainable these measures have allowed the city to reduce its budget deficit for the current fiscal year from one hundred ten million dollars $11000000000 to somewhere between twentythree million dollars $2300000000 and thirty million dollars $3000000000 the citys pension obligations are as aforesaid a major contributor to the citys fiscal crisis a major cost driver of the citys pension system is in turn the annual costofliving adjustments colas enjoyed by hundreds of city retirees more specifically many of the retirees pensions compound at rates ranging from as high as three 3 percent to six 6 percent approximately onefourth 14 of retirees are currently receiving annual colas of five 5 percent to six 6 percent a pension with a six 6 percent compounding cola doubles approximately every twelve 12 to thirteen 13 years and a pension with a five 5 percent compounding cola doubles approximately every ten 10 years 9 suspension of the colas until the pension system attains a more secure level of funding of seventy 70 percent would result in significant and desperately needed cost savings for the pension system and the city this measure would immediately increase the funding of the system from its current rate of thirtyone 31 percent to almost forty 40 percent further the measure would result in a two hundred forty million dollars $24000000000 reduction of the unfunded pension liability from nine hundred million dollars $90000000000 to six hundred fiftynine million dollars $65900000000 the measure would also reduce the arc and result in one hundred 100 percent funding of the pension system several years ahead of the current

adequate property values  and in order to maintain property values the city needs to provide access to gainful employment for its citizens 8 unless the citys citizens are provided with an opportunity to be hired on projects that their tax dollars fund unemployment will remain high property values will further decline foreclosures will increase crime will also increase and the city will not be able

bicycle parking spaces are required if the change in use would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10% this also applies to a simultaneous change in use of a group of uses on the same lot

immediate previous use required ten vehicle parking spaces but was only able to provide four vehicle spaces the six vehicle spaces that the use was unable to provide are grandfathered with the site when a new use is undertaken in the structure that requires 12 vehicle spaces it will be deficient eight vehicle spaces as four are already constructed on the site the six deficient vehicle spaces from the previous use are then applied to this eight vehicle space deficiency meaning that the new user shall provide two more vehicle parking spaces or apply for a variance if unable to provide the additional vehicle spaces see calculation below for further illustration of this example sample calculation of grandfathered parking provision step 1 immediate previous use required parking 10 spaces
