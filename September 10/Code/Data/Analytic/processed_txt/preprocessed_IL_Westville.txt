cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property  the topography of the village contains areas with steep slopes which if clearing of trees andor inappropriate construction takes place could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in damage to property  excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing
