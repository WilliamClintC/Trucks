definitions compliance proof of verification of employment eligibility compliance with applicable federal law sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of city ordinance noncompliance penalties   purpose and legislative findings athe city council hereby finds that there has been an ongoing national debate regarding the inherent inequities which exist between employers that comply with all federal state and local laws and regulations in connection with the hiring of their employees and employers that fail to comply with those laws and regulations bthe city council further finds and determines that these inequities result in a financial disadvantage for those employers who comply with all applicable federal state and local laws and regulations in the hiring of their employees while reciprocally providing an unfair financial advantage to those employers who did not comply with the law cthe city council also finds and determines that employer noncompliance with federal state and local laws and regulations that regulate the hiring of employees results in diminished protections of employees from unfair labor practices and fosters the circumvention of minimum wage prevailing wage and health insurance coverage requirements dtherefore the purpose of this chapter is to provide a means of facilitating and encouraging compliance with federal law including but not limited by enumeration to the simpsonmazoli act also known as the immigration and reform and control act of 1986 irca appearing at 8 usc 110 et seq by requiring businesses to verify that their employees are legally eligible to be employed in the united states and establishing an enforcement mechanism at the municipal level against noncompliant businesses which the city council finds will 1help to promote the federal policy of requiring employers to verify the employment status of potential employees  2help to eliminate unfair competitive advantages between businesses  3help to eliminate unfair labor practices and the exploitation of workers  4help to assure taxpayers that employers and employees are paying their fair share of taxes by complying with tax laws  passed 10232012   definitions as used

of variances athe variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels this unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city council of lake havasu city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate

variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in

development overlay 1purpose aa planned development overlay pdo is a development in which structures land use open space transportation facilities and utility systems are integrated overall design concept on a single parcel or aggregate parcels of land approved by city council bcity review is accomplished by combining subdivision conditional use and design review into a single process designed to provide a framework for the development of a more desirable urban environment of contemporary site planning techniques and architectural forms cthe planned development process is aimed at permitting creativity and flexibility in site design that may not be achieved strict adherence to zoning district and subdivision standards applicable to the base zoning district dthe pdo district is intended to encourage efficient use of land and resources that can result in savings to the community consumers and developers  preserve valuable landscape terrain and other environmental amenities  and provide diverse and innovative living working or shopping environments that consider community needs and activity patterns 2applicability in accordance with the requirements of this the pdo zoning

at the time the zoning overlay district and development plan are approved and development within the district shall be limited to those uses specifically approved in those documents any addition of
