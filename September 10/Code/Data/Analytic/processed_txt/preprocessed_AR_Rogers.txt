compliance with the below listed provisions as a condition preceding any development of the land so zoned any such designation example  pudc2 shall be restricted to both the underlying zone c2 and the additional requirements of the pud designation in its entirety if there is a conflict between any regulations or requirements contained in the pud final plan and the underlying zoning the conditions of the additional pud designation shall prevail the pud zoning district designation shall be submitted to city council only upon approval of the pud final plan by the planning commission the final plan and all of its relevant contents shall be attached as an exhibit to the relevant zoning ordinances when presented to the city council and if approved shall become fixed requirements directly tied to the zoning and development of the subject property as long at the pud zoning designations remain unchanged a pud zoning designation not be considered by the city council without an attached final plan previously approved by the planning commission approval of a pud zoning designation and final plan do not relieve the property owner of the requirements of largescale development plans or subdivision regulations if otherwise required city code 2 approval considerations to be approved a planned unit development pud must comply with the provisions of this section and must achieve at least one of the following purposes a more efficient use of land  b more efficient use of public facilities  c more usable open space grouping and other design techniques  and d preservation of appropriate natural andor physical features 3 potential reasons for the denial of a pud the planning commission in its review of the concept plan may deny the use of the pud provision for any of the following reasons a the pud plan did not achieve the stated purposes  b the proposed pud plan was incomplete  c the pud plan was incompatible with the surrounding area  d sufficient public facilities and services were not available to the proposed site  and e the proposed development would create or compound a traffic hazard 4 permitted uses  a uses allowed by right  all uses allowed by right within the underlying zoning district shall be allowed by right within the pud b conditional uses  i a use that is not permitted under subdivision a4a of this section may be approved as a conditional use in the pud zoning district if the use is allowed in any zoning district under this ii the planning commission may consider a request for conditional use under subdivision a4bi of this section a using the procedure established in section 14723  or b with the pud final plan if the conditional use is requested as a part of the pud final plan iii if a conditional use is requested with the pud final plan the provisions of section 14723 will apply except that a the notice provided under this section shall be sufficient notice of the conditional use request  and b the applicant shall not be required to submit an application or pay a fee in addition to the pud final plan submission and fee under this section 5 pud size the minimum land area for a pud is five acres 6 density a the dwelling

section b the following density bonus may be provided for additional open space if the underlying zoning district rsf rmf provides a density bonus or increase for open space the property owner may receive an additional density bonus as provided for in the chart contained in this subsection a6b of this section the required open space for the relative density of the underlying zones is required to exist in the pud as a whole but not necessarily only in the individual underlying zoning designation example  a pud with 10 acres of rmf requiring 40% open space and 10 acres of c2 requiring 20% of open space would require a total of 6 acres of open space for the entire pud project the developer would not necessarily be required to put 4 acres of open space in the rmf area and 2 acres of open space in the c2 area but may place the open space anywhere within the pud as long as the total open space area requirements are met for the entire pud  hereafter referred to as combined pud open space it is the option of the ownerdeveloper to build by placing the traditional amount of open space in the respective underlying zones or to build in the combined pud open space manner listed above if an owner or developer choses to build using the combined pud open space manner and opts to build the pud in phases the undeveloped area with the highest level of required open space required shall be build first in time the preceding requirement may be specifically waived by the planning commission based on other considerations assurances or guarantees sufficient to ensure that future phase development will meet the required open space percentage required of the entire pud additional open space percentage  authorized in addition to any underlying density increases allowed for open space density increases given in the underlying zoning designation percentage open space increase allowed increased units per acre 10 3 15 5 20 7 7 pud expansion  variance the planning commission may vary

urdc city becomes mandatory it shall establish the following zones for all properties within the urdc area a establishment of urdc zones the urdc area is distinguished into different zones each zone is intended to respond to distinct urban aspects within uptown rogers and is based on the vision for the different zones within the urdc area each zone shall establish use and building form standards including standards for building height mass placement functional design and parking the uptown regional center zoning plan classifies all lots within the urdc area into one of the following four zones i uptown core mixed use ucorthe purpose of the uptown core mixed use zone is to allow highintensity highdensity urban mixeduse development characterized by pedestrianpriority streetscapes inviting storefront ground level retail and other commercial services and upper floor office and residential uses city blocks shall incorporate onstreet parking parking garages that are located so that they are internalized and do not dominate the development context and public spaces that are connected by a walkable street network thereby ucor allows for all essential elements of liveworkplay within walking distance provides the most efficient use of land and is designed to accommodate multimodal transportation including car pedestrian bicycle and public transit ii uptown commercial mixed use ucomthe purpose of the uptown commercial mixed use zone is to allow relatively dense pedestrianfriendly primarily commercial mixeduse development that retains many of the characteristics of the ucor zone while allowing more flexibility with respect to building disposition singleuse form offstreet parking options and increased setbacks ucom attains increased density over traditional singleuse strip mall or office park form parking and maximum parking requirements shared access maximum setbacks pedestrian connectivity between adjacent properties the use of boulevards and public spaces iii uptown entertainment uentthe purpose of the uptown entertainment zone is to allow the development of large entertainment venues such as concert pavilions and sports facilities within the uptown area and compatible ancillary uses for such venues the intent is for these venues to retain pedestrian connectivity to the rest of the uptown regional center maximize the use of onstreet and other offsite parking provide for a variety of uses and present a high level of architectural excellence that enhances the overall character of the urdc area iv uptown neighborhood transition unbtthe purpose of the uptown neighborhood transition zone is to provide medium to highdensity residential infill between the other urdc zones and surrounding existing residential neighborhoods unbt development is typically characterized by residential structures that are singlefamily 2 to 3stories with very small or zero side setbacks such as brownstones townhomes garden homes or similar housing types that normally feature front onstreet parking and rear or sideentry garages b street designations the streets within the urdc area shall be classified by their street type in coordination with the master street plan and the context of the surrounding development street cross sections shall address vehicular lane widths number of lanes pedestrian accommodation street tree requirements onstreet parking and parkway and median standards these standards are laid out in street design standards streets within the urdc area shall complement the complete streets plan for the city of rogers c building frontage standards building frontage designations shall classify and regulate the required amount of building frontage required for a development based on the vision for development context building frontages are categorized into one of three types i pedestrianpriority frontage has the highest quality standard for pedestrianoriented building design focus is on wider sidewalks ample clear space appropriate street furniture adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area building will be required to address the pedestrian area and provide a higher quality of commercial design standards curb cuts shall be limited allowing for their utilization where they support particular uses without dominating the pedestrianpriority context such as portecochere entrances for hotels ii pedestrianfriendly frontage has a middle quality standard for pedestrianoriented building design focus is on adequate sidewalks ample clear space continuous walkability adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area pedestrianfriendly frontages lead to pedestrianpriority frontages and expand connections to these areas into adjacent neighborhoods iii general frontage has a basic quality standard for pedestrianoriented building design any frontage not labeled as a pedestrianpriority or pedestrianfriendly is considered a general frontage focus is on required pedestrian access adequate clear space select locations for street furniture adequate lighting screening and safe vehicularpedestrian interactions within the streetscape area d public open space designation  public open space within the urdc shall be designated according to the development standards for each zone detailed standards for public open space or improvement to existing public

and intent these provisions are intended to provide a means for objective analysis of residential density in the city of rogers it is important for the city to responsibly facilitate growth by encouraging density where appropriate and restricting density where inappropriate the citys comprehensive growth map cgm provides the basis for the highest and best use of land and designates select areas for higher intensity development the cgm sets density ranges and organizes them by growth designation in an effort to accommodate both administrative and discretionary approval processes for residential development proposals growth designations are broad land use categories organized by purpose character and level of development intensity with various zoning districts allowed within each designation b density concept plan a density concept plan dcp is the mechanism used to assess the impact of exceeding the base density of a given growth designation per the citys cgm impact is assessed by two primary considerations the compatibility of a proposed density in terms of land use and building form and the capacity of the transportation network to support the proposed density 1 applicability a dcp is required when a development proposal involves a gross residential density above the base limit of the subject growth designation per the citys cgm a calculating density gross density shall be calculated as the ratio of dwelling units to total site area including public rightsofway common open space and nonbuildable land net density shall be calculated as the ratio of dwelling units to residential area excluding public rightsofway common open space and nonbuildable land in the neighborhood center growth designation the land area used for gross density calculation shall include the entirety of the neighborhood center b association with rezone in order to ensure compliance with all conditions of acceptance a rezone ordinance is the means by which a dcp becomes enforceable and assigned to a specific land area an accepted dcp shall be filed with and attached to the subject rezone ordinance that reflects the density established in the dcp c existing zoning designations in cases where a residential zoning designation is already in place but the property has not developed a dcp is required to accompany a development proposal that exceeds the base density of its growth designation subject to all procedural requirements of this d modifications if a development proposal seeks to deviate from an accepted dcp and the deviations are minor in that they are warranted due to sitespecific constraints and do not substantially alter the overall density layout or design the modification may be approved by staff if the deviations are significant in that they are not warranted by sitespecific constraints or substantially alter the overall density layout or design the modification shall be required to obtain acceptance of a new dcp subject to all procedural requirements of this 2 submittal and review procedure a dcp submittal shall be made subject to the following requirements a provide proof of a presubmittal conference with staff b submit a complete dcp application with any relevant supplemental materials including but not limited to site plans elevation drawings schematic drawings written narratives reports or other materials requested by staff all submittals shall at a minimum provide the following information i site area  ii building setbacks  iii building height  iv building elevations  v building materials breakdown  vi lot coverage and open space calculations  vii impervious area calculations  viii physical constraints easements or other encumbrances  ix current and proposed zoning  x dwelling unit counts  and xi gross and net density calculations c once a complete dcp application has been submitted it will be placed on the agenda for the next available plans and policy committee meeting staff will conduct a technical analysis of the dcp in advance of said meeting and provide recommendations to the committee the plans and policy committee may take the following actions on the proposed dcp i recommend for acceptance by the planning commission as presented  ii recommend for acceptance by the planning commission with conditions  or iii deny as presented or table for further consideration d if recommended for acceptance the applicant may submit a rezone application per to accompany planning commission action on the dcp the rezone public hearing is the means by which the rezone and dcp are considered the planning commission may take the following actions on the proposed dcp and rezone request i accept dcp as presented and recommend rezone andor dcp for city council approval  ii accept dcp with conditions and recommend rezone andor dcp for city council approval  or iii deny dcp as presented or table for further consideration e once accepted by planning commission the dcp is considered approved upon the city councils passage of the proposed rezone ordinance per if the rezone request is approved by the city council the accepted dcp shall be attached to the rezone ordinance establishing permanent rules specific to the new zoning district until amended or replaced 3 review criteria the appropriateness of a proposed density shall be considered with regard to the following considerations a compliance with the citys schedule of uses  b consistency with the purpose character and goals of the subject growth designation per the citys cgm growth designation character is evaluated by the following i building form ie scale massing placement roof pitch height frontage type and similar considerations  ii architectural design ie style colors materials window shape faade articulation and similar considerations  and iii site layout ie access open space building disposition landscape sightlines street design and similar considerations c capacity of the surrounding transportation network to adequately support an increase above base density capacity is generally assumed to be adequate in most situations if land use is in compliance with the cgm and all other official plans policies and standards nonetheless it remains beneficial to consider additional factors on an asneeded basis determined by the context of a given development proposal including but not limited to the following i trip generation estimates per ite trip generation manual current edition  ii a current traffic study including average daily traffic adt and peak hour volume data of impacted roadways  iii roadway safety characteristics pavement condition and impact of existing and proposed nearby development  iv traffic management characteristics such as internal circulation routes access points calming methods and parking management techniques  and v travel demand factors such as onsite amenities and mixeduse proximity to essential goods and services and the integration of nonvehicular infrastructure exh a 2262019 accessory dwelling units adu a applicability this section creates provisions for the existence of accessory dwelling units within the city of rogers this

followed by the city stormwater coordinator when enforcement action is necessary on sites that do not comply with the citys stormwater pollution prevention erosion control and grading and tree preservation ordinance enforcement cases can be generated in any of three ways construction review process  from individuals groups etc  and from citystate agencies procedures to be followed for each of these methods are outlined in this section 1 construction review every effort is made to use the construction review process to correct deficiencies in site compliance whenever possible should that process fail to achieve expected results or if the site reviewer feels that a violation is serious enough to warrant enforcement action the following procedures shall be followed a issuance of notice of violation if site deficiencies are noted the ownerdeveloper or authorized agent shall be given a notice of violation the notice of violation shall be specific as to the noted violation corrective measures to be taken and time frame allowed to complete the work b compliance review at the end of the time period specified in subsection 1a of this section a followup site inspection shall take place to determine whether compliance has been achieved depending on that determination the following actions may occur 1 site violations corrected if all previous site violations have been corrected the site reviewer shall issue an inspection report stating that fact and the site shall be returned to a normal construction review status 2 previous violations not corrected if previously noted violations have not been satisfactorily corrected the further actions may be initiated as outlined in the following section 2 submissions from the general public members of the general public may submit information pertaining to this article to the department of community development the stormwater coordinator will consider such submissions as they pertain to the implementation and enforcement of this article and will provide written or verbal response to the person submitting the information 3 referrals from other agencies referrals from other agencies will be handled in the following manner a cases will be referred directly to the stormwater coordinator at this point the stormwater coordinator will determine if enforcement actions are warranted and if proper documentation has been obtained if the stormwater coordinator determines that action is required the enforcement process will be set into motion b cases received by the stormwater coordinator will be handled on a first come first served basis all enforcement actions will be initiated by a site inspection to verify site conditions that caused the case to be referred if conditions have been corrected or do not exist as stated in the referral the case will be returned to file for documentation and reporting purposes if conditions exist as stated in the referral enforcement actions will proceed c once site conditions have been verified and the site is determined to be in a state of noncompliance two avenues of enforcement can be pursued one for the infrequent offender and one for the frequent offender 1 infrequent offender if an individual or company is being reviewed by the stormwater coordinator for the first time or it has been at least three years since the last violation 36 months has elapsed since last review a notice to comply will be issued to the ownerdeveloper informing them they are not in compliance with the citys stormwater pollution prevention erosion control and grading and tree preservation ordinance the steps needed to be taken to get into compliance and that they have an established time frame to complete the work at the end of the period the stormwater coordinator will reinspect to check for compliance if all work has been satisfactorily completed the case will be returned to file for documentation and reporting purposes if the work has not been satisfactorily completed within the established time frame a citation ticket will be issued to the ownerdeveloper and followup will be done until the site is brought into compliance 2 frequent offender if an individual or company has been reviewed by the stormwater coordinator at any time in the preceding 36 months they will be considered repeat offenders repeat offenders will be issued a citation ticket by the stormwater coordinator upon verification of noncompliance with the citys stormwater pollution prevention erosion control and grading and tree preservation ordinance and after consulting with the department of community development follow up will continue until the site has been brought into compliance 4 enforcement options for failure to comply a the city stormwater coordinator in conjunction with the department of community development may issue a stop work order to any persons violating any provision of the citys stormwater pollution prevention erosion control and grading and tree preservation ordinance by ordering that all site work stop except that necessary to comply with any administrative order b the city stormwater coordinator may request that the department of

erosion control and sediment control erosion control is the protection of the soil surface from the impact of rain drops and the resulting detachment of soil particles sediment control are the practices that capture soil particles that have been detached and transported down slope it is far more efficient and cost effective to prevent erosion than to capture sediment b design methodology and bmp selection criteria construction bmps are typically designed for erosion control sediment control or control of wastes hazardous solid etc for the best results bmps should be used in series with one or more bmps the operator of the construction site should concentrate efforts on erosion control  but provide sediment control backup bmps a listing of construction erosion and sediment control bmps and the benefits each provides is shown in table 1 further information on each bmp is presented in the following sections of this article table 1 construction bmp characteristics chart c construction planning  minimize clearing and compaction 1 description clearing of natural vegetation and vehicular traffic on the site will expose and compact soils causing erosion and greater amounts of runoff minimization of clearing and compaction will decrease the amount of soil exposed to erosion and will decrease the amount runoff from due to compacted soil 2 applicability existing vegetation can often be incorporated into the design and construction of a development lessening the amount of bare soil exposed to rain and wind compacted soil does not allow for adequate infiltration of precipitation therefore increasing runoff quantities and flowrates increased flowrates increase erosion and sediment transport 3 design criteria landscaping and clearing requirements vary from project to project vehicular traffic within the construction site should be limited and confined to areas that are protected with adequate sediment control practices 4 limitations some native plants and grasses are not considered appropriate for developed sites  so nonnative grasses and plants would need to be planted 5 maintenance requirements maintenance of protective fencing as needed d construction sequencing 1 description exposing soil before required for construction can expose the soil to erosion for an extended period construction sequencing coordinates land disturbing activities with construction requirements to minimize the amount of soil exposed to erosion at any time 2 applicability only land needed for building activities and vehicular traffic should be cleared projects on larger sites and on projects that land disturbing activities can be phased are best suited for construction sequencing 3 design criteria areas of the site to be preserved should be clearly marked on the plans and delineated on the site the timing of clearing and access to different areas of the site should be indicated in the contract documents 4 limitations sometimes smaller projects do not lend themselves to sequencing of land disturbing activities 5 maintenance requirements maintenance of protective fencing as needed e runoff and runon control bmps see city of rogers arkansas

has been received within 24 hours d enforcement action 1 bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2 the control
