or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages  5 regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 qualify for and maintain participation in the national flood insurance program c objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone sewer lines streets and bridges
