following provisions are intended to supplement not to replace or to supplant the wisconsin public records laws b records custodians 1 designation of records custodians and alternate custodians custodian means that officer department head of the city of delafield who is designated by the mayor or by the terms of this article to keep and preserve public records or whom is required by law to file deposit or keep such public record in hisher office or is lawfully in possession or lawfully entitled to possession of public records the city clerktreasurer is the legal custodian of the records of the common council as a body politic and for all common council boards committees and commissions each alderperson shall be the custodian of their individual official records such as their correspondence memorandums and email any alderperson may designate in writing the city clerktreasurer to act as the official custodian of the alderpersons individual official records for every department the department head is the custodian of records for their agency every custodian of records shall designate in writing one or more employees to act in his or her absence as an alternate custodian of such records 2 duties custodians are vested with full legal power to render decisions and carry out the duties of the city under this article each custodian shall establish a procedure for handling records and shall see that all of their employees entrusted with records are informed of these procedures if a custodian has any question about granting or denying a request to inspect or copy any record he or she may consult with the city attorney 3 public records training each custodian and alternate custodian shall receive training regarding public records laws as soon as practicable upon receiving these duties custodians and alternate custodians are personally responsible for keeping current with any developments or advancements in records keeping and the wisconsin public records laws c procedural information 1 form of request the wisconsin public records law dictates that certain actions must be taken with regards to oral requests for records and that certain more formal actions are taken in response to written requests for records however the state law does not expressly state how to respond to the following methods of communication therefore requests made by the following means shall be responded to as follows a email a request made by email may be responded to via email or in writing and shall have all of the formalities as though the request was made in writing b voicemail a request made by voicemail shall be responded to as though it were made orally c instant messagingtext messaging a request made in either such manner shall be treated as an oral request 2 treatment of certain data as records the wisconsin public records law provides little or no guidance as to whether the raw and perishable data of the following technologies qualify as records that must be maintained therefore the common council determines the following status of these technologies a email the data in an email message may constitute a public record and is subject to maintenance as a public record the data in an email is subject to the same analysis under the public records statutes as an equivalent paper or hard copy record the city administrator is responsible for ensuring that all emails are properly preserved for such analysis b voicemail a voicemail message is not a public record and voicemail messages do not have to be maintained as public records these messages are the functional equivalent of phone conversations phone conversations clearly are not public records additionally these messages also share many of the attributes of personal notes which are not public records either finally these messages cannot be indexed or maintained in any manner that would allow for their easy classification searching or retrieval c instant messaging imtext messaging tm except as set forth in this subsection and in subsection c2i and j of this section the data involved in imtm communications is not subject to maintenance as a public record imtm has all of the attributes of instantaneous exchange of ideas as does a regular telephone conversation furthermore the data exchange has the same technological issues as to capturing and storage of data that is present with regards to voicemail with an additional concern  the raw data is often only briefly stored or not stored at all by the third party vendors or hosts that provide these services thus this technology is even closer to a true telephone conversation than are voicemails therefore city employees and officials shall refrain from using such services for official communications purposes or for matters that would result in a public record if another format such as email or written communications were employed unless the employee or official preserves a copy of such communications by either copying them to their email account downloading the communications to their city computer making a computer file of the communications or by printing and retaining a copy of such communications d voice over the internet protocol voip the city does not monitor nor record the data associated with the conversations that occur over voip such conversations are the very same real time voice communications as standard telephone conversations that are not public records the only difference between these communications is the medium employed in transmitting the voice communications from one participant in the conversation to all others involved in the conversation e audio video data transmissions and communications although audio video data and radio transmissions and communications may be processed computers the city does not routinely copy the data nor maintain records of such communications whenever the city copies records or maintains copies or recordings of such communications or transmissions those copies may constitute public records that are subject to records requests and which must be maintained according to the appropriate records retention schedule the waukesha county consolidation dispatch center is the custodian for police and fire radio communications f audiovideo recordings unless otherwise provided herein are public records subject to requests and must be maintained according to the retention schedules published herein 1 rewritable recording systems those systems where the recordings are routinely overwritten by newer recordings such as in continuous loop videotape or digital video written to a cameras hard drive or memory such data does not constitute a record unless it is further downloaded printed or separately preserved to memorialize some event or proceeding until such time as these recordings are downloaded printed or separately preserved these recordings do not have to be preserved and as the recording equipment programsprotocols may dictate can be overwritten erased or otherwise destroyed however if such data is downloaded printed or separately preserved it shall be treated as a record and shall be retained in accordance with the retention schedules 2 recordings made for the purpose of preparing minutes of meetings in accordance with wis stats  19217  any tape or digital recording of a meeting as defined in wis stats  19822  by any city body as defined by wis stats  19821  to include each city board commission and committee may be destroyed overwritten or recorded over no sooner than 90 days after the minutes have been approved and published if the purpose of the recording was to take minutes of the meeting g electronic document files where records as that term is defined in wis stats  19322  exist in an electronic format only such electronic records shall be maintained according to the appropriate retention schedule where both hard copy ie paper and electronic copies of a record exist they shall each be subject to public records requests however when the custodian has designated pursuant to subsection c2i of this section electronic records as the official records only the electronic copy shall be retained and made available for inspection under the public records laws where the custodian has not made such a designation only the hard copy shall be subject to inspection as a public record and the electronic copies shall be treated and disposed of as draft documents that do not need to be maintained beyond creation of the final hard copy h electronic logstemporary data files these logs and temporary data files provide detailed information about the design and functionality of the citys computer network these logs are routinely overwritten on a daily basis due to the high volume of traffic that is being logged unrestricted access to these logs and files would constitute a breach of system security and leave the system vulnerable to exploitation and hacking in order to ensure network security these logs are available to city administrators authorized staff only these determinations apply to the following types of logs and data files 1 syslogs for network electronic devices all logs created by network devices such as firewalls routers switches etc which are used for monitoring and trending computer network traffic patterns andor detecting unauthorized network traffic 2 network server security application and event logs these logs are used to monitor activity on city network servers including successfulunsuccessful login attempts file system access hardware performance etc these logs provide detailed information about city network account ids file system structure and hardware profiles 3 network security appliance logs all logs created by network security devices such as the antivirus appliance antispam appliance content filtering appliance etc which are used to monitor specific types of unauthorized or malicious traffic on the city network these logs identify specific network traffic patterns andor protocols that are allowed or disallowed on the city network 4 application logs these logs are used to monitor activity on various database applications but do not contain specific audits of database transactions these logs can contain version information program variables and programming logic i emerging technologies and records retention as new information technologies emerge the city administrator shall evaluate these technologies and their benefit to city operations the city administrator shall consider whether any of these technologies provide the capacity to archive public records created by these technologies whenever it is economically and practically feasible to archive records created by such technologies that archiving shall be incorporated into any deployment of said technologies whenever the technologies do not provide for such archiving capabilities the city administrator shall consider whether the benefits of employing such technologies outweigh the risks that some public records may not be retained by deployment of such technologies where such benefits outweigh these risks city employees shall refrain from using such technologies for official communications purposes or for matters that would result in a public record if another format such as email or written communications were employed in the event that such technologies are used for such communications purposes the employee shall preserve a copy of such communications by either copying them to their email account downloading the communications to their city computer making a computer file of the communications or by printing and retaining a copy of such communications the city administrator shall also ensure that as soon as practical and economically feasible archiving systems are obtained for any information technology that is deployed without an archiving system j use of technologies to avoid duty to preserve public records prohibited no employee shall use or employ any form of communications or information technology with the intent or design to circumvent the records retention requirements of this article for example text messaging shall not be used in lieu of email to share or create a public record unless the employee complies with the provisions of subsection c2i of this section d access to records  fees 1 format for delivery of records a same format as record exists and redacted records except as otherwise provided by law any requester may receive or inspect a record in the very same format in which the city maintains the record however whenever it is necessary to redact or excise portions of a record in order to comply with the wisconsin public records laws the redactions shall be made with the assistance of the city clerktreasurer whenever electronic redaction or excisions cannot be done in a secure manner that preserves such redactions and prevents the viewing of the redacted information then such redactions should be made by hand not electronically and the requestor shall only receive a hard copy not an electronic copy of the redacted record a requestor may not be charged for the time necessary to review a record and to redact or excise nonreleasable materials b emailing records when practicable records may be emailed to the requestor in order to ensure the integrity of city records any emailed document shall be converted to a secure format so that the document cannot readily be edited changed or modified by the recipient prior to sending the document to anyone outside of the city government there shall not be any reproduction charge for emailing records however such records may still be subject to payment of a location fee as established in wis stats  19353c 2 reproduction fees to the extent possible the city administrator and the city clerk shall develop a uniform fee schedule for the reproduction of records that shall be used by every department such schedule shall include the following provisions and considerations a fees imposed upon a records requestor may not exceed the actual necessary and direct costs of reproducing andor transcribing of the record unless a fee is otherwise specifically established or authorized by state or federal law b if the record exists in such a format that it cannot be easily reproduced such as a mockup of a building then the custodian may photograph the record and may charge the requestor for the actual necessary and direct costs of such photographing and photographic processing c the fee schedule for photocopying records shall be 1 a fee established from time to time by resolution adopted by the common council 2 full cost of reproduction for materials such as microfilms tapes computer printouts etc not otherwise identified in the schedule developed under this subsection in such cases the department head who is the records custodian in consultation with the city clerktreasurer must determine the costs for reproduction of such records the determination of these costs shall be made by utilizing a practice or factors that are as uniform as practicable across city departmentsdivisions 3 other fees i location fee if the cost of locating a requested record is $5000 or more the requester shall pay the full cost as determined by the department or division head such cost shall not exceed the actual necessary and direct cost of locating such record whenever it is determined that such location costs will exceed $5000 the requestor shall be required to post a deposit with the custodian that is equal to the reasonable good faith estimate of such costs ii mailing fee custodians shall impose a fee upon a requester for the actual necessary and direct cost of mailing or shipping of any copy or record that is mailed or shipped to the requester 4 fee waivers a custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where the department head determines in writing that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest 5 prepayment of fees custodians may require prepayment by a requester of any fee or fees imposed under this subsection if the total amount exceeds $500 and a custodian shall require prepayment by a requester of any fee or fees imposed under this subdivision if the total amount exceeds $5000 if prepayment is required the custodian shall not process the request until such prepayment has been posted with the custodian e special rules regarding reproduction of email records 1 reproducing emails dated earlier than  emails dated  or before were not stored in an archive the restoration and location of these emails is difficult and labor intensive such requests often take more than 30 days to comply with due to labor and technical issues custodians who receive requests for these records should inform the requestor of these issues such requests must be immediately forwarded to the city administrator who may prepare an estimate of the actual necessary and direct cost of locating such records and whom shall provide technical assistance to the custodian 2 reproducing emails dated  or later all city of delafield email transactions dated  or later have been preserved in a searchable data archive when requests are made for such records custodians should clarify with the requestor the various search terms and email boxes that the requestor would have the city clerktreasurer search for once the requestor has specified search terms the custodian should contact the city administrator for technical assistance in fulfilling the request emails are archived and retained for seven years and shall be purged in the eighth year of retention 3 email chains emails are often sent to multiple recipients a requestor will be provided with one copy of such an email and all responses to that email unless a requestor specifically requests otherwise they will not be provided with multiple copies of such an email showing receipt by each of the designated email recipients f time for compliance and procedures 1 time the fulfillment of public records requests is a high priority for the city therefore each custodian upon request for any record shall as soon as practicable and without delay either fill the request or notify the requester of herhis determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefore if a request may take more than ten business days to process then the custodian must respond to the requestor within those ten days with an estimate of when such processing shall be completed and an explanation of the reasons supporting that estimate 2 city attorney consultation required before any custodian may deny access to any records or portion thereof the custodian must consult with the city attorney such consultation shall occur as soon as practicable after the custodian has assembled and reviewed the requested record in any response to a requestor the custodian shall include a statement that he or she consulted the city attorney regarding the denial of access to any records any denial of access made by a custodian without such consultation and statement is not considered a response from the city of delafield g no destruction of records while a request is pending or while a denial of a request is being appealed no custodian may destroy any record at any time after the receipt of a request for inspection or copying of the record until after the request is granted or until at least 60 days after the date that the request is denied if any legal action

of natural resources under wis admin nr  01  rep & recr # 730  findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled construction site erosion and stormwater runoff from land development and land disturbing activities carry a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the water and rightsofway of the state and this city this has a significant detrimental impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled erosion and stormwater runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increase stream temperatures  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes thereby overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other drainage facilities  6 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  7 generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment 02 purpose and intent a purpose the purpose of this article is to set forth requirements for land development and land disturbing activities designed to minimize sedimentation water pollution flooding and related property and environmental damage caused by soil erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff during and after construction in order to diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the natural resources of the city and the state specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions  2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater prevent and control soil erosion prevent and control water pollution protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  3 ensure the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  prevent conditions that endanger downstream property  and 4 establish erosion control and stormwater standards for building sites placement of structures and land uses and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty b intent it is the general intent of the common council that this article achieves its purpose of the quantity and quality of longterm postconstruction erosion control and stormwater discharges from land development activities it is not intended to limit activity or land divisions permitted under applicable zoning and land division ordinances the common council recognizes that the preferred method of addressing erosion control and stormwater management problems and needs is preparation of comprehensive erosion control and stormwater management system plans for subwatershed areas which are designed to meet the purpose and intent of this article where such system plans have been developed and approved by the planning commission it is the intent that all land development activities will include stormwater management measures that meet performance standards set forth in those approved plans where such stormwater management system plans have not been developed or approved by the commission it is the intent of the commission that the generic stormwater management standards set forth in section 16319a and b be
