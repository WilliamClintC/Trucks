the motion the council member making the motion may rephrase amend or withdraw it after an amendment the motion as amended must still be seconded and then voted upon it is particularly important when a motion is amended that the presiding officer restate the motion as amended cin making a motion council members must avoid combining multiple proposals in the same motion if a council member prefers to see proposals divided and voted upon separately the council member should ask the presiding officer to divide the motion into separate motions for consideration the presiding officer may then proceed to treat each distinct proposal as a distinct motion each requiring its own second and to be acted upon separately the presiding officer should solicit motions when the situation demands by either inviting a motion or suggesting a motion to the council members res 2017287 passed 1092017  3516 the four basic motions athe basic motion puts forward a decision for consideration example i move that we create a fivemember committee to plan the annual fundraiser bthe motion to amend changes a basic motion under consideration example i move we amend the motion to have a tenmember committee a motion to amend requires a second and must be decided before the council returns to consideration of the original motion cthe motion to postpone to a date certain proposes delay in further discussion of the matter under consideration until a specific stated time at which the item will be debated further example i move we postpone further discussion of this item until our first regular meeting in october dthe motion to lay on the table postpones discussion of an item indefinitely unless taken off the table example i move we table this item tabling an item leaves it on the table and no specific time is stated for further discussion it stays on the table until a later agenda item provides notice it will be brought from the table for further discussion res 2017287 passed 1092017  3517 debate amost motions except for procedural motions such as calling the previous question adjournment and the like are debatable debate may continue as long as council members wish to discuss an item subject to any motion for previous question which ends debate absent a successful motion for previous question debate will end if the presiding officer solicits further comments and none are forthcoming bsome motions are not debatable the presiding officer should immediately call for a vote of the council without debate on the following 1motion to adjourn this motion if passed requires the council to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting this motion requires a simple majority vote 2motion to end debate or the previous question the most common form of this motion is to say i move the previous question or i move the question or i call for the question when a council member makes such a motion the council member is really saying ive had enough debate lets get on with the vote the motion requires a second if the motion carries by twothirds majority of those council members present all further debate is concluded and the question put in this order first upon the amendments pending and then upon the main proposition before the council 3motion to limit debate an alternative to the previous question is a motion to limit debate which includes by its stated terms a time limit for example i move we limit debate on this agenda item to 15 minutes the motion to limit debate requires a twothirds vote of the council 4motion objecting to consideration a similar motion is a motion objecting to consideration of an item this motion is not debatable and if passed precludes the council from even considering an item on the agenda it also requires a twothirds vote 5motion to lay on the table a motion to lay a question upon the table is not debatable 6motion to postpone to a date certain a motion to postpone to a date certain is not debatable

to fix the time to adjourn this motion if passed requires the council to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion for example the motion might be i move we adjourn this meeting at midnight it requires a simple majority vote 9motion to recess this motion if passed requires the council to immediately take a recess normally the presiding officer determines the length of the recess which may range from a few minutes to an hour it requires a simple majority vote res 2017287 passed 1092017  3518 majority and supermajority votes in addition to the specific rules for passage of motions resolutions and ordinances as set by state law there are procedural exceptions to the rule of passage by a simple majority the exceptions occur when the city council is taking an action that effectively cuts off the ability of a minority opinion to take an action or discuss an item these extraordinary motions require a twothirds majority a supermajority to pass amotions to limit debate whether a council member says i move the previous question i move the question i call for the question or i move to limit debate these motions if successful cut off the ability of the minority to discuss an item bmotion to object to the consideration of a question normally such a motion is unnecessary because the objectionable item is usually tabled or defeated however when council members do not wish there to be any consideration of an item such a motion is in order it is not debatable res 2017287 passed 1092017  3519 motion to reconsider aafter a vote is taken the matter is deemed concluded and is subject to reconsideration only upon a timely motion a motion to reconsider shall only be made by a council member who originally voted in favor of the measure such as a council member on the prevailing side a motion to reconsider requires a twothirds majority vote to pass but there are two limitations first a motion to reconsider may be made at the meeting where the item was first voted upon the motion maybe made at any time before adjournment a motion to reconsider may also be made in the case of a failed measure if made at a subsequent meeting within ten days of the original measures failure by a council member who voted against the measure bif the motion to reconsider passes then the original matter is back before the city council and a new original motion is in order cthe matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor for the first time donce a matter has been duly reconsidered no further motion to reconsider the issue can or shall be made without the unanimous consent of the city council eno question shall be reconsidered more than once nor shall a vote to reconsider be reconsidered this rule does not prevent substantively different iterations of the measure from being brought forth at later meetings of the council further once a new city council is seated following the next regular election any matter may be revived res 2017287 passed 1092017  3520 limiting debate and discussion adebate and discussion should be focused but free and open at the same time the mayor may limit the time allotted to speakers including council members in the interest of efficiently and effectively using time bgenerally a council member will not be interrupted by other council members but may be under the following circumstances 1privilege the proper interruption would be point of privilege the mayor would then ask the interrupter to state your point appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would interfere with the comfort of the meeting participants for example the room may be too hot or too cold or a blowing fan might interfere with a persons ability to hear 2order the proper interruption would be point of order the mayor would ask the interrupter to state your point appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting  for example if the mayor moved to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing discussion or debate 3appeal if the mayor makes a ruling with which a council member disagrees that council member may appeal the ruling of the mayor to the parliamentarian 4call for orders of the day this is another way of saying lets return to the agenda if a council member believes the council has drifted from the agenda such

effectiveness the city council and all appointed advisory boards committees and commissions are policyoriented groups the advisory groups operate as satellite units which focus on particular concerns issues or problems in the community when an advisory board committee or commission has an item on a city council meeting agenda a representative from that body shall be present at the city council meeting similarly when a member of any board committee or commission addresses the city council at a public meeting he or she should always clearly state whether he or she is speaking on behalf of the advisory group or as an individual finteractions with city council  procedural guidelines the city council considers input and recommendations from a variety of sources in its decisionmaking process therefore the council may not always follow the specific recommendations of any one particular board committee or commission in adopting policy or procedure once the council has established its position members of advisory groups may continue to have reservations or individual objections as representatives of the larger group however members should remember they are expected to act in a manner consistent with the established policy andor program as approved by the city council gcouncil policy on legislative issues 1the city council is ultimately responsible for establishing city policy and determines the public position of the city on legislative matters therefore commissions boards or committees shall not issue public statements on legislation pending before the city council unless said statements are reviewed and approved by the council 2this policy is not intended to prevent advisory groups from carrying out their normal functions publicly and openly  rather its purpose is to establish that boards committees and commissions do not issue policy statements or take public positions which fall within the purview of the city council hsubmitting a formal request for consideration  procedure in the event a board committee or commission wishes to request the city council endorse or approve a particular position or idea formulated by the board committee or commission said request should first be reflected in the minutes of the meeting of the board committee or commission at which the action was approved following such action the board committee or commissions secretary or staff liaison should submit a written request to the city council with a copy to the city administrators office for inclusion on the agenda of an upcoming council committee or city council meeting in the interim copies of the request will be made available to all council members the communication should include the degree of urgency and a specific statement of the action requested irelations with the public council members and members of appointed boards committees or commissions are encouraged to maintain awareness of public opinion citizen input should be welcomed and heard at meetings and members should be considerate of all interests attitudes and differences of opinion members should be vigilant about maintaining not only the appearance but also the principle of impartiality jconflicts of interest 1to determine whether an applicant to a board commission or committee has a conflict of interest applicants should review iac chs 3625 3626 and 403a assistance is available from the city attorneys office if applicants have questions about this matter 2in the event a city council member determines that he or she has a direct definite demonstrable conflict of interest regarding an issue before the council that conflict should be clearly stated at the beginning of council deliberations council members should consult the city attorney or private counsel of their own choosing prior to deliberating or voting on a matter on which the council member believes he or she may have a conflict of interest the matter of what constitutes a conflict of interest is often misunderstood and misstated people elected to public office are frequently motivated to seek office because of their personal interest in certain issues the mere fact that their lives may generally be affected either positively or negatively by a decision of the city council does not by itself create a conflict of interest rather a legally significant conflict of interest stems from a conflict between a direct definite and demonstrable personal interest of the council member particularly pecuniary business or familial and the judgment the council member must exercise in the matter to be decided whether a conflict of interest exists can only be determined by applying the individual facts to the law again council members should consult legal counsel if in doubt about a conflict of interest issue 3another matter arises from time to time which may create the appearance of a conflict of interest elected officials are frequently solicited to join such organizations as the chamber of commerce marshall economic development and the like participation in these organizations results in an exchange of valuable information and views nevertheless when such an organization takes a position in favor of or in resistance to a proposal pending before the city council at the very least the appearance of a conflict of interest exists it may appear to the layperson that membership in the organization involved would create an irreconcilable conflict of interest a case might be made that a city council member has a conflict of interest while he or she is a member of an organization if that organization appears before the city council and takes an official position on an issue under such circumstances it may be advisable for elected officials to abstain from voting on that issue again consultation with legal counsel is advised 4city officers or employees are restricted by iac  3625 with regard to direct or indirect benefits they may receive from any contract performed for the city that code section provides as follows a city officer or employee shall not have an interest direct or indirect in any contract or job of work or material or

size of the operations the amendment creates two additional classifications for cius 1nonsignificant ciu cius that consistently comply with applicable pretreatment standards consistently discharge less than 100 gpd of categorical wastewater and never discharge any untreated concentrated wastewater may be classified as nonsignificant ciu this classification reduces the monitoring requirements for an industry and does not require that the facility have a pretreatment permit however they must continue to comply with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and provide annual certification of compliance 2middle tier ciu cius which are<001% of potws design dry weather hydraulic capacity or 5000 gpd whichever is smaller measured by continuous effluent flow monitoring unless the ciu is a batch discharger   of potws design dry weather treatment capacity  and <001% of the maximum allowable headworks loading mail for any local limits to be eligible for classification as a middle tier ciu the ciu must not have been in snc for any time in the previous two years and the daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels cannot vary significantly whereby reduced reporting would not be representative of operating conditions adoption of these classifications allows for reduced monitoring and regulatory burden for cius with very low flows and potential to impact

improper operation 2an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for non compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements hereof are met 3an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that aan upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset  bthe facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and cthe industrial user has submitted the following information to the potw and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset  if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days ia description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  iithe period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the

defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in   and  of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users

substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions d2c3

becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times  and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent occurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4enforcement actions and approval of an anticipated bypass shall be as follows abypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless ithe bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  iithere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iiithe industrial user submitted notices as required hereunder bthe potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division d2c4a above 2013  passed 8231993  passed 5231994  passed

districts   statutory authorization the legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare passed 4122010   findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community bthese losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by 1the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood  and 2the cumulative effect of floodplain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities c1this subchapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the states department of natural resources 2this methodology consists of a series of interrelated steps including adetermination of flood magnitudes and the corresponding flood frequencies by statistical and engineering calculations which permits a consideration of such flood factors as expected frequency of occurrence area inundated and depth of inundation  bcalculation of water surface profiles based upon hydraulic engineering analysis of capability of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey flood flows  and ccomputation and delineation of a floodway an area which must be reserved no obstructions for conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be substantially increased by future encroachment on the floodplain passed 4122010   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare by minimizing those flood losses described in   of this chapter with provisions designed to areserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially  brestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  crequire that uses vulnerable to floods including public utilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time
