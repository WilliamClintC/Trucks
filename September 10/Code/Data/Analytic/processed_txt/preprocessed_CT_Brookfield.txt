wpd a candlewood lake watershed district clw 1 background candlewood lake the states largest lake and one of its most important inland water resources has experienced a gradual deterioration of water quality since about 1950 studies of the lake shoreline development area have recommended planning to avoid the need to install a public sewer system brookfield is one of five connecticut towns that border the lake shore the lakes watershed area is 26461 acres and brookfields portion is 1177 acres or 4 percent of the total however the watershed in brookfield especially the lake shore area is generally intensively developed and a primary source of stormwater runoff that can carry nutrients and pollutants that contribute to the eutrophication of the lake and deterioration of lake and groundwater quality these regulations are designed to minimize and where possible reduce the negative impact of stormwater runoff affecting candlewood lake and the watershed area thereby reducing the rate of lake eutrophication and avoiding the need for a public sewer system 2 purpose the purpose of the candlewood lake watershed district is to prevent nutrient enrichment or contamination of candlewood lake and its watershed and to avoid the need for sewers in this densely developed area of brookfield specifically the purposes are a to minimize the impervious surfaces and maximize infiltration of stormwater runoff 2019april19 special districts 114 introduction definitions residential commercial industrial special districts standards miscellaneous procedures administration enforcement b to reduce peak stormwater flow and minimize the likelihood of soil erosion stream channel instability flooding and habitat destruction c to preserve andor create vegetative buffers of native plantings to control and filter stormwater runoff d to minimize disturbance of natural grades and vegetation and utilize existing topography for natural drainage systems e to contain stormwater runoff on the site wherever possible to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff before it reaches the groundwater or surface water bodies f to prevent and minimize potential groundwater pollution from improper waste disposal release of hazardous materials and other sources 3 land to which these regulations apply these regulations apply to all land within the boundaries of the candlewood lake
