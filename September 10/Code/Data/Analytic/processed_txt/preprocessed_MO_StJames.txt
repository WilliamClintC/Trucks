explicit sexual material and sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of st james missouri and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including explicit sexual materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this restrict or deny access by adults to explicit sexual materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent or effect of this condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or offensive material of a sexual nature findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities as outlined in numerous studiesreports generally available for consideration and on findings incorporated in a series of cases as found and included herein by reference to the ilm model sexually oriented business regulation the city council finds that sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises employees of certain sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments and that by offering or providing such locations may thereby create unhealthy conditions unless properly regulated at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infections hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts the number of cases of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases has been on the rise or remain at high levels in the united states the findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns by establishing that sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the public interest and to address substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is managed in a way consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the general public it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on

by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in conduct that this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this barring of such individuals from the management of adult
