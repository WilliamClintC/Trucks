is recognized that the zoning chapter is structured to regulate land use and development patterns of a conventional or traditional nature  however there are situations where innovative proposals for use of land may be submitted which do not relate to ordinance controls and would have to be rejected even though feasible and beneficial to the community it is to accommodate such innovative proposals even those that exceed stipulated residential densities or depart from traditional lot sizes that the planned development district is established the technology of land development is constantly changing and creative but practical approaches to the use of land should be encouraged the provisions of this section are intended to do so in a manner which is in the best interests of both the
