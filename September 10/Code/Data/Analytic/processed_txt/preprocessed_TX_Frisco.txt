services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other

findings from the texas city attorneys associations 2008 commissioned study and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are generally uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further mechanisms are needed to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of some sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including but not limited to masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions undesirable incidental effects and increases the possibility of the spread of communicable diseases 5 persons often frequent certain sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 engaging in physical contact at a sexually oriented business is not a form of expression protected by the first amendment 7 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities that occur in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a and non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 8 from 1999 to 2002 there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  25174 in 199 25522 in 200 25643 in 200 and 26464 in 200 compared to 1982 when only 600 cases were reported 9 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990    421684 10 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 11 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that areas around sexually oriented businesses experience increased criminal activity including increased property crimes violent crimes and sex crimes 16 numerous studies and reports have determined that retailonly sexually oriented business business that sell or rent goods that can be viewed or consumed offsite such as adult video stores adult book stores and adult novelty stores create a negative secondary effect of reducing surrounding property values as well as increasing crime in the surrounding area  17 the findings noted in subsections 116 above raise substantial governmental concerns 18 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 19 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is operated in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 20 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting and visibility by a manager or third party on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal andor unsanitary sexual activity occurring therein 21 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 22 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid with the prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases    422684 23 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 25 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and sexually related crimes 26 there is an increasing commercial exploitation of human sexuality by owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses where alcoholic beverages are served or offered for sale for consumption on the premises or where alcoholic beverages are permitted to be consumed 27 that such exploitation takes place in the form of employing or permitting persons to perform or exhibit their nude or seminude bodies to other person as an inducement to such other persons to purchase alcoholic beverages or to consume alcoholic beverages while on the premises 28 such exploitation is further often accompanied by serious and dangerous criminal activity such as prostitution disorderly conduct assaults and the like 29 that the direct result of such exploitation in the context of the location where it is permitted ie where alcohol is serve or consumed in a sexually oriented business threatens the preservation of property values of adjoining and adjacent properties and neighborhoods 30 the
