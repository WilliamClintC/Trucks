management  statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities cont1ibutes to erosion and sedimentation  overtaxes the callying capacity of streams and stonn sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control effotts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff  is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth  their resources and the environment c stormwater is an imp01tant water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains smface water quajity d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater

management for small projects applicability stormwater management procedures for projects with between five hundred 500 square feet and 4999 square feet of proposed impervious area all of the proposed impervious area that is created by a regulated activity must be disconnected impervious area otherwise the applicant cannot use this document to meet stormwater management requirements and is therefore responsible for meeting all stormwater management requirements of the impervious area and regulated activities are defined in of this document note this small projects document is not to be used to plan for multiple lots without obtaining prior written approval from the municipality approvals and actions associated with this document do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code law or ordinance stormwatermanagelientprocedures for small projects introduction this handbook has been developed to allow homeowners to comply with stormwater management criteria for new projects to meet the requirements of the act 167 stormwater management the municipality including sizing designing locating and installing onlot measures referred to herein as best management practices bmps pennsylvania act 167 was authorized on  32 ps pl 864 and gave pennsylvania municipalities the power to regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface and groundwater quantity and quality individual home construction projects on singlefamily lots which result in between 500 square feet and 4999 square feet of proposed impervious area including the building footprint driveway sidewalks and parking areas are not required to submit formal stormwater management swm site plans to the municipality or county  however  they i  are still required to address water quality and infiltration goals as outlined in this small projects document if the guidelines presented in this brochure are followed the individual homeowner will not require professional services to comply with these water quality and infiltration goals l describes requirements and outlines the method for designing a suitable bmp and a description of what needs to be included on the simple sketch plan presents definitions of key terms presents options of bmps that can be considered for onlot stormwater management an example of how to obtain the size and dimensions of a bmp is explained in the stormwater management method for small projects requires  the first 1 of rainfall runoff from proposed impervious surfaces to be captured see definition of captured in  the purpose of this small projects document is to help reduce stormwater runoff in the community to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources and public safety what needs to be sent to the municipality even though a formal swm site plan is not required for individual lot owners the small projects worksheet found in table c4 and a simple sketch plan containing the features described in step 4 of needs to be submitted to the municipality and if applicable the contractor prior to construction l  i c1 determination of simplified approach volume requirements all proposed impervious areas must be included in the determination of the amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed bmps needed to control stormwater proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot include roof area pavement sidewalks driveways patios porches permanent pools or parking areas sidewalks driveways or patios that are constructed with gravel or pervious pavers that will not be converted to an impervious surface in the future need not be included in this calculation therefore the amount of proposed impervious area can be reduced for proposed driveways patios and sidewalks use of gravel pervious pavement and turf pavers all proposed impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a bmp  no runoff can be directed to storm sewers inlets or other impervious areas ie street in addition the use of low impact development is recommended to further minimize the effect of the new construction on water land and air low impact development is a method of development that incorporates design techniques that include minimizing the amount of land disturbance reducing impervious cover disconnecting gutters and directing runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate and redirecting the flow of runoff from impervious driveways to vegetated areas instead of to the street or gutter the amount of impervious area that needs to be controlled may be reduced by disconnecting impervious areas as discussed below as a bmp and as found in b below are the steps that must be undertaken to meet the the results obtained for each step must be included in the small projects worksheet found in table c4 step 1  determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces that will need to drain to one or more bmps determine locations where bmps need to be placed so that runoff from all of the proposed impervious surfaces can be captured select the bmps to be used and determine the requirements of each from for instance the back half of a garage may drain 200 square feet of roof to a rain barrel and the front half of a garage may drain 200 square feet of roof and 540 square feet of driveway to an infiltration trench then obtain the required storage volume and surface area needed for each of the proposed bmps from the appropriate heading below for rain barrelscisterns step 2 select the proposed impervious area value in column 1 of table c1 that is closest to but not less than the determined value step 3  determine the volume that needs to be

meet state water quality requirements to promote groundwater recharge and to otherwise meet the purposes of this bmps are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories or measures  structural or nonstructural in this non structural bmps or measures refer to operational andor behavior related practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural bmps or measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff  structural bmps include but are not limited to a wide variety of practices and devices from largescale retention ponds and constructed wetlands to smallscale underground treatment systems infiltration facilities  filter strips low impact design bioretention wet ponds permeable paving  grassed swales riparian or forested buffers sand filters detention basins and manufactured devices  structural stormwater bmps are permanent appurtenances to the project site

and the requirements and applicability of dia as a bmp rain barrelscisterns rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns gardens and other landscaped areas after the rainfall has ended rain barrels are typically between 50 and 200 gallons in size the stored water can also be used as a nonpotable water supply cisterns are larger than rain barrels having volumes of 200 gallons or more and can be placed on the surface or underground figures c2 and c3 show examples of rain barrels and cisterns respectively that could be used rain barrels and cisterns are manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes all of these facilities must make provisions for the following items  there must be a means to release the water stored between storm events in order for the necessary storage volume to be available for the next storm  stormwater must be kept from entering other potable systems and pipes and storage units must be clearly marked do not drink  an overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top with an overflow pipe to divert flow away from structures  use screens to filter debris and covers lids to prevent mosquitoes  make sure cisterns are watertight and do not leak  rain barrels are typically assumed to be 25% full to calculate volume since they are not always emptied before

infiltration trench is a long narrow rockfilled trench with or without a perforated pipe that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet runoff is stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe and infiltrates bottom and into the underlying soil matrix infiltration trenches perform well for removal of fine sediment and associated pollutants figure c4 shows a typical infiltration trench configuration infiltration trenches shall incorporate or make provisions for the following elements  perforated pipe is to be set level  the width is limited to between 3 and 8 feet and the depth ranges from 2 to 5 feet  trench should be wrapped in nonwoven geotextile see definition in  on the top sides and bottom  there should be a positive overflow that allows stormwater that cannot be stored or infiltrated to be discharged into a nearby vegetated area  roof downspouts may be connected to infiltration trenches but should contain a cleanout to collect sediment and debris before entering the infiltration area  infiltration testing is recommended to ensure that the soil is capable of infiltrating stormwater a description of how an infiltration test is performed is found in appendix c of the pennsylvania stonnwater best management pra ctices manual document no 3630300002   it is recommended that there be a 2foot clearance above the regularly occurring seasonal high water

that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of buildings or other impervious surfaces a dry well can be either a structural prefabricated chamber dry well #1 or an excavated pit filled with stone fill dry well #2 dry wells discharge the stored runoff via infiltration into the surrounding or underlying soils figure c6 shows a typical prefabricated dry well and a typical dry well configuration with stone fill the following elements shall be incorporated into all dry well designs  these facilities should be located a minimum of ten 10 feet from the building foundation to avoid foundation seepage problems and are not recommended if their installation would create a risk for basement flooding  construction of a dry well should be performed after surface soils in all other areas of the site are stabilized to avoid clogging  during construction compaction of the subgrade soil in the bottom of the dry well should be avoided and construction should be performed only with light machinery  depth of a dry well should be between 15 feet and 4 feet gravel fill should consist of stone of an average of one and one half to three 15  30 inches in diameter with the gravel fill wrapped in a nonwoven geotextile that separates the stone fill from the surrounding soil  at least 1foot of soil needs to be placed over the top of the dry well  dry wells should be inspected at least four 4 times annually as well as after large storm events  dry wells should have overflow pipes to allow high volumes of runoff to connect to other onsite substantial infiltration areas or pervious areas  every dry well needs to have at least one monitoring well  infiltration testing is recommended to ensure that the underlying soil is capable of infiltrating the needed volume of

good condition and any bare spots should be revegetated as soon as possible  vehicles shouldn t be parked or driven on an infiltration trench and care should be taken to avoid excessive compaction by mowers  any debris such as leaves blocking flow from reaching an infiltration trench or bioretentionrain garden should be routinely removed  while vegetation is being established pruning and weeding may be required for a bioretentionrain garden  mulch in a bioretentionrain garden needs to be respread when erosion is evident once every two to three years or after major storms the entire area may require mulch replacement  at least twice a year the landowner needs to inspect the bioretentionrain garden for sediment buildup and vegetative conditions  during periods of extended drought the bioretentionrain garden requires watering  trees and shrubs in a bioretentionrain garden need to be inspected at least twice per year by the landowner to evaluate their health if they are in poor health they need to be replaced  dry wells need to be inspected by the landowner at least four times a year and after significant rainfalls  and debristrash  sediment and any other waste material need to be removed and disposed of at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with local state and federal waste regulations   for dry wells gutters need to be regularly cleaned out and proper connections must be maintained to facilitate the effectiveness of the dry well  the filter screen for the dry well that intercepts roof runoff must be replaced as necessary   dry wells that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced within two weeks of being damaged  if an intermediate sump box exists in conjunction with a dry well it must be cleaned out at least once per year  rain barrels and cisterns need to be cleared of debris routinely at least every three months and after significant storms to allow stormwater from gutters to enter them  gutters that directly convey rain water to dry wells rain barrels and cisterns need to be routinely cleared of trash and debris at least every three months and after significant storms  rain barrels and cisterns must be kept covered  rain barrels and cisterns should be routinely emptied so that they are only 14 of the way full to allow for storage of additional rainwater  overflow outlets from rain barrels and cisterns must be kept
