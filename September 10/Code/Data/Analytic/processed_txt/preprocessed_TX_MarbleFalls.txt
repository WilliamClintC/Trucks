governmental concerns 19 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which would be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 20 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure

premises and activities occurring therein 21 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 22 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 23 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter 25 the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten 10 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 26 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter o5b  i 5222001 definitions adult arcade means any

minute showerhead faucet aerators and ultralow flush one and sixtenths 16 gallons per flush toilet installed c retrofit program the city will make available education and information programs information for water customer use when purchasing and installing plumbing fixtures lawn watering equipment or water using appliances the program will inform existing users of the advantages of installing water saving devices additionally the city in partnership with lcra makes available to customers low flow shower heads and faucet aerators at no charge and upon request d water conservation oriented pricing structure the city has implemented an inclined block water rate structure where in the unit cost of water increases within blocks as customer usage increases the inclined block structure has been effective in encouraging conservation with lower rates for lower volume users and higher rates for higher volume users annual audits are conducted to evaluate promoting conservation the rate structure does not impact low end users alleviating the burden on low income and fixed income residents e universal metering all water customers including utility city offices and public facilities are presently metered also master metered are currently installed and periodically calibrated at all existing water sources all new construction is separately metered the city computer billing system currently monitors water consumption and inspects meters which vary from its previously established norms in addition the city will adopt a meter maintenance and replacement program as follows 1 production master meters  test once per year 2 meters larger than one 1 inch  test once per year 3 meters one 1 inch or smaller  test once every ten 10 years through a successful meter maintenance program coupled with computerized billing water audits timely repairs and leak detection program the city will keep unaccounted for water losses below fifteen 15 percent f landscape irrigation conservation initiatives in order to reduce the demands placed on the water system by landscape watering the city adopted new landscape regulations requiring all redevelopment and new development to adhere to the citys approved plants and trees list which includes only native adaptive and drought tolerant trees plants grasses and vegetation additionally the city will encourage customers and local landscaping companies to utilize water saving practices in installation and the maintenance of landscaping for residential and commercial institutions some of the methods to be promoted are as follows 1 require landscape architects to use native and adapted plant materials that can tolerate periods with low water input and require less fertilizers and pesticides to maintain as well as water efficient irrigation system design and technologies such as hydro zones to group plant materials of similar water needs 2 require licensed irrigation contractors to permit and install all irrigation systems with water efficient features such as a proper irrigation system design techniques to match the landscape design accommodate prevailing wind patterns and minimize overspray onto hardscapes  b sprinklers that emit large drops rather than fine mist  c irrigation controllers that offer multiple start times are capable of running multiple programs have a water budget feature and are rain or moisture sensor capable  d rain or moisture sensors to prevent irrigation system operation during rainfall events  e drip irrigation where possible and in all landscaped areas less than ten 10 feet wide medians parking islands etc 3 encourage commercial establishments to use drip irrigation for landscape watering when practical and to install only ornamental fountains that recycle and use minimal quantities of water 4 encourage the utilization of separate irrigation meters in an effort to more effectively monitor and manage landscape irrigation usage 5 partner with lcra to conduct no cost evaluations of landscape irrigation systems for citizens and provide citizens with information regarding the irrigation technology rebate program g leak detection and repair the city conducts monthly water system audits in order to track for unaccounted water current loss is calculated to be at eight 80 percent city maintenance technicians also conduct visual inspections at meters

intended to promote compatible patterns of land use and site development consistent with the citys comprehensive plan b districts established the city of marble falls is hereby divided into 13 zoning districts that are established by table a zoning districts established additionally the existing neighborhood zone enz district is further divided into five subdistricts as set out in table b enz subdistricts established all land within the city limits shall be classified into one of the following zoning districts table a zoning districts established district type name symbol purpose agricultural farm and ranch district fr the farm and ranch district is intended to protect the urban fringe from incompatible development and unplanned development by allowing the continuation of farming and ranching activities and remaining rural in character large minimum lot size and rural roadway crosssection a cluster development option allows for smaller lot sizes with larger amounts of open space as the city grows over time this land is intended to transition in accordance with the community vision set out in the future land use plan of the citys comprehensive plan residential rural estate district re the rural estate district is intended to provide the opportunity to develop a large lot subdivision prior to public utilities being available it is intended to remain rural in character suited for larger lot higher end housing to remain rural in character the lot width and setbacks are large a minimum subdivision area is established and roads are designed with a rural roadway crosssection a cluster development option allows for smaller lot sizes with larger amounts of open space neighborhood residential district nr the neighborhood residential district is intended to be the default singlefamily detached district and suburban in character it includes various flexible lot size configurations but is tied to an overall development density although it will be comprised of predominantly singlefamily detached housing different development options developed as a master planned community could allow a small percentage of new development to be denser attached housing types these areas are developed with an urban roadway crosssection transitional residential district tr the transitional residential district is intended to provide areas of higher density and different housing types than in the neighborhood residential district it is tied to an overall development density and is intended to provide an area of transition between the lower density neighborhood residential district and higher density districts eg multifamily commercial etc these areas are developed with an urban roadway crosssection downtown residential district dr the downtown residential district is intended to promote infill development and redevelopment while also preserving the older and sometimes historic pattern and character of old town marble falls the intent of this district is to provide areas of housing adjacent to downtown as a transitional area between the nonresidential areas of the downtown district and the residential areas more typical of the marble falls area this area would be similar to the transitional residential district in that it would provide for higher density and different housing types than in the neighborhood residential district  however it is intended that the downtown residential district would respect and even enhance the residential culture of the overall downtown area and urban center of marble falls in this regard it is intended that this area will redevelop with an urban character and an urban roadway crosssection multifamily residential district mr the multifamily residential district is intended to provide areas of even higher density than in the transitional residential district it is tied to an overall development density and is intended to provide an area of transition between the lower density transitional residential district and higher density districts eg commercial these areas will be developed with an urban roadway crosssection existing neighborhood zone district enz the existing neighborhood zone district is intended to protect the established development pattern and character of existing neighborhoods while also providing opportunities for infill development and improvements to existing homes generally existing neighborhoods are divided into subdistricts based on their existing and intended development character see also special design standards for existing neighborhood zone district nonresidential neighborhood commercial district nc the neighborhood commercial district is intended for nonresidential development that is of an appropriate use scale and design that is compatible with abutting or nearby residential development accordingly these areas are intended to take on the semiresidential appearance of their abutting residential areas these developments typically occupy smaller footprints have lower levels of signage and deemphasized parking general commercial district gc the general commercial district is primarily intended for nonresidential development along the citys major thoroughfares in accordance with the vision set out in the future land use plan of the citys comprehensive plan these areas are intended to be developed with an autooriented character which means that the view of the automobile is the predominant view from the street rightofway additional design considerations such as building orientation form architecture and materials  front and streetside landscaping  parking lot landscaping  and access management are used to improve the quality of development consistent with the vision set out in the citys comprehensive plan downtown district dn the downtown district is intended to serve the central core of the general area identified as downtown on the future land use plan of the citys comprehensive plan it is envisioned that this area will be developed with a higher intensity urban character which means high lot coverages buildto lines and limited setbacks low to no landscaping and a focus on onstreet parking when applicable it is also intended to include a mix of both residential eg apartments lofts etc and nonresidential uses downtown transition district dt the downtown transition district is intended to serve the area surrounding the downtown district and within the outer edges of the general area identified as downtown on the future land use plan of the citys comprehensive plan it is envisioned that this area will also be developed with a higher intensity urban character but not as intense as the downtown district and will include higher lot coverages buildto lines and limited setbacks limited landscaping and an intent to hide parking behind the building or locate onstreet when applicable it is also intended to include a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses business industrial park district bp the businessindustrial park district is intended to support various employment opportunities predominantly related to light manufacturing light industry or warehousing it is intended that these uses will be undertaken entirely within an enclosed building additional landscaping and screening requirements will help to protect areas of outdoor storage from public rightsofway and abutting properties general industrial district in the general industrial district is intended for areas of greater intensity than the businessindustrial park district these areas are to provide a range of development opportunities including such uses as manufacturing fabrication andor warehousing these areas have the potential to involve heavy truck traffic as such they require direct access to a principal arterial additionally since the operations of these uses could occur both indoors and outdoors these areas require larger buffers against abutting development mixed planned development district pd a planned development district is intended for developments with a wellplanned mix of integrated land uses and densities the district is provided to facilitate new and innovative development concepts that cannot be accommodated as a masterplanned community or by other zoning districts c enz subdistricts established the enz district is further divided into

thoroughfare plan shall be demonstrated by preparation and submission prior to or along with the preliminary plat application of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with d traffic impact analysis below which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property in the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed the planning or zoning commission or city council may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed preliminary plat in the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project the city may require an update of the study for each subsequent phase of the development which reflects any applicable changed conditions if the preliminary plat is in conformance with the thoroughfare plan and if the preliminary plat is for a development of less than two hundred 200 dwelling units or for a development generating less than two thousand 2000 oneway trips per day then a traffic impact analysis is not required 4 approach roads and access all subdivisions must have at least two 2 points of vehicular access primarily for emergency vehicles and must be connected via improved roadways to the citys improved thoroughfare and street system by one 1 or more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth requirements for dedication of rightofway and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis a two 2 points of vehicular access shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two 2 improved roads accessing the subdivision from the citys improved thoroughfare system and the subdivision has at least two 2 road entrances the city council may at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise public safety or impede emergency access accept a single mediandivided entrance from the citys improved thoroughfare system provided that the median extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least one hundred 100 feet to an intersecting internal street which provides at least two 2 routes to the interior of the subdivision for example the entrance street is not a deadend or culdesac and it does not create a bottleneck allowing only one 1 emergency route into the interior of the subdivision residential lots may not front onto any mediandivided street section and residential driveways may not be located in front of a median also see o points of access below b the subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public safety vehicles each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated public street as required by applicable zoning or thirtyfive 35 feet whichever is greater unless other provisions

unless other provisions have been authorized development approval 5 offsite improvements where traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for such facilities or where the city believes public safety is at risk the property owner shall make such improvements to offsite collector and arterial streets and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or in conjunction with related developments the city may participate in the costs of oversize improvements with the property owner as set out herein and subject to the citys cost participation policies on oversized improvements 6 street dedications a dedication of rightofway the property owner shall provide all rightsofway required for existing or future streets and for all required street improvements including perimeter streets and approach roads as shown in the thoroughfare plan and as required by the tcss or by other valid development plans approved by the city in the case of perimeter streets half of the total required rightofway width for such streets shall be provided unless the proposed development is on both sides of the street in which case the full rightofway width shall be provided or unless there is some other compelling reason to require more than half of the rightofway width such as avoiding the infringement upon or demolition of existing structures avoiding crossing a creek or flood plain or some other obstacle or other similar circumstance in some instances more than half of the required width shall be required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual or proposed alignment of the street such as in the case of a curved street as may be required by the city b perimeter streets where an existing halfstreet is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition the other half of the street shall be dedicated and an appropriate amount of the street shall be improved by the developer of the new subdivision or addition c slope easements the dedication of easements in addition to dedicated rightsofway shall be required whenever due to topography additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes such slopes shall be no steeper than three 3 feet horizontal run to one 1 foot vertical height or a threetoone  slope 7 street construction all streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed and paved to

and dedication of rightsofway for streets and street improvements whether onsite or offsite intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision the city council shall determine whether the proposed streets and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established and may require that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the city council determines to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be adequately served by streets and thoroughfares 10 private streets new subdivisions may not be constructed with private streets nor may an existing subdivisions public streets be converted to private ownership any private street subdivisions that were in existence ie platted of record at the county on the effective date of these regulations shall be allowed to remain as private street subdivisions provided that the conditions of the private streets and the maintenance thereof continues to meet or exceed city standards and provided that a viable homeowners association hoa continues to exist to maintain the private streets and all appurtenances the city will not assist in enforcing deed

herein the city may enter the private street subdivision and remove any gate or device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association d waiver of services certain city services may not be provided for private street subdivisions among the services which may not be provided are routine law enforcement patrols enforcement of traffic and parking regulations and preparation of accident reports depending upon the characteristics of the development and upon access limitations posed by the design of entrances into the subdivision other services such as sanitation may not be provided as well e petition to convert to public streets the property owners association may petition the city to accept private streets and any associated property as public streets and rightofway upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership however in no event shall the city be obligated to accept said streets as public should the city elect to accept the streets as public then the city has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the citys acceptance of the streets the city shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed the city may also require at the associations or the lot owners expense the removal of any guard houses access

use of the subdivision by the city or governmental or utility entity c escrow policies and procedures 1 request for escrow whenever these regulations require a property owner to construct a street or thoroughfare or other type of public improvement the property owner may if there exists unusual circumstances such as a timing issue due to pending roadway improvements by another agency such as txdot or the county that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing petition the city to construct the street or thoroughfare usually at a later date in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this more than one street or thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy requirements for roadways as demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis tia the city manager or designee may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be accepted and require the deposit of all funds attributable to the development in escrow accounts for one or more of such affected roadways the city council shall review the particular circumstances involved a tia may be required to facilitate the city councils deliberations on the matter and shall determine at its sole discretion whether or not provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owners obligation to construct the street or thoroughfare with his or her development 2 escrow deposit with the city whenever the city council agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under these regulations the property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the city in an amount equal to his or her share of the costs of design construction permits reviews and approvals inspections any additional land acquisition and an appropriate and realistic inflation factor to ensure that the actual future dollar costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in the future such amount shall be reviewed and approved by the city manager or designee and by the city engineer and shall be paid prior to release of the construction plans by the city engineer the obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owners transferees successors and assigns  and the liability therefore shall be joint and several 3 determination of escrow amount the amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the maximum comparable turnkey bid price of construction of the improvements including design permits reviews and approvals inspections and any additional land acquisition that may be needed such determination of the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city manager or designee and the city engineer 4 termination of escrow escrows or portions of escrowed amounts which have been placed with the city under this which have been held for a period of ten 10 years from the date of such payment or agreement in the event that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made shall upon written request be returned to the property owner along with onehalf  of its accrued interest such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for 5 refund if any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements in the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority the difference between the property owners actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds including accrued interest if any shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements 6 interest limitation if money is refunded within six 6 months of deposit only the principal will be refunded monies returned after this date will be refunded with onehalf of its accrued interest d traffic impact analysis 1 generally any proposed development project or plat involving a significant change to a proposed roadway alignment from that shown on the city of marble falls thoroughfare plan or involving a development of two hundred 200 or more dwelling units or for developments generating two thousand 2000 or more oneway trips per day shall be preceded by submission city staff review and planning and zoning commission review and city council approval of a traffic impact analysis tia as specified in d2 required components of traffic impact analysis below such a proposed roadway alignment change shall also be preceded by or simultaneous with an amendment to the citys thoroughfare plan showing the new proposed alignment failure to provide for such approvals prior to submission of a preliminary plat or concurrently with the preliminary plat application shall be grounds for denial of the plat application 2 required components of traffic impact analysis whenever these regulations or the city council in unique instances which do not necessarily meet the above criteria but which may significantly affect the public health safety or welfare such as a proposed subdivision that will only be accessed via substandard roadways which may pose an impediment to emergency response vehicles require submission and city council approval of a tia the following elements shall be included a general site description the tia shall include a detailed description of the roadway network within one 1 mile of the site a description of the proposed land uses the anticipated states of construction and the anticipated completion date of the proposed land development this description which may be in the form of a map shall include the following items 1

existing and proposed public transportation services and facilities within a one 1 mile radius of the site b proposed capital improvements the tia shall identify any changes to the roadway network within one 1 mile of the site that are proposed by any government agency or other developer this description shall include the above items as well as any proposed construction project that would alter the width or alignment of roadways affected by the proposed development c roadway impact analysis i transportation impacts a trip generation the average weekday trip generation rates trip ends the average weekend trip generation rates for uses other than residential or institutional the highest average am and pm hourly weekday trip generation rates and the highest hourly weekend generation rates for uses other than residential or institutional for the proposed use shall be determined based upon the trip generation rates contained in the most recent edition of the institute of transportation engineers trip generation book  or shall be based upon data generated by actual field surveys of area uses compatible to the proposed use and approved by the city manager or designee and the city engineer b trip distribution the distribution of trips to arterial and collector roadways within the study area identified in d2a general site description above shall be in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles taking into consideration the land use categories of the proposed development  the area from which the proposed development will attract traffic  competing developments if applicable  the size of the proposed development  development phasing  surrounding existing and anticipated land uses population and employment  existing and projected daily traffic volumes  and existing traffic conditions identified pursuant to d2a general site description above ii adequacy determination the roadway network included within the tia shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing roadways identified as arterials and collectors can accommodate the existing service volume and the service volume of the proposed development and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid unexpired building permits at a level of service c or above d intersection analysis i level of service analysis for intersections within the roadway tia area described in d2a general site description above a level of service analysis shall be performed for all arterial to arterial arterial to collector collector to arterial and collector to collector intersections and for any other pertinent intersections identified by the city manager or designee or by the city engineer also level of service analyses will be required on all proposed site driveway locations for all nonresidential developments the city may waive analysis of minor intersections and site driveway locations within the onemile radius the level of service analysis shall be based upon the highest hourly average am or pm peak weekday volume or highest average hourly peak weekend volume as determined from a twoday survey of weekday volumes and where necessary a oneday survey of weekend volumes the level of service analysis shall take into consideration the lane geometry traffic volume percentage of righthand turns percentage of lefthand turns percentage and typical size of trucks intersection width number of lanes signal timing and progression roadway grades pedestrian and bicycle flows school routes number of accidents and peak hour factor ii adequacy analysis the intersections included within the tia shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing intersections can accommodate the existing service volume the service volume of the proposed development and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid unexpired building permits at level of service c or above e effect of adequacy determination if the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in d2a general site description above that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereby the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one 1 of the following conditions i the deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed  ii a reduction in the density or intensity of development  iii the dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein  or iv any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections within the tia study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such development e arrangement of streets not shown on the thoroughfare plan for streets that are not shown on the citys thoroughfare plan such as local residential streets the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall 1 provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas  2 conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the city council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical  3 provide for future access such as by stubbing streets for future extension to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or for a similar type of land use  and 4 not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings including those on the other side of an existing or planned mediandivided arterial in which case new streets shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared f residential collector streets and minor residential streets residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by will be discouraged such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions 1 wherever the rightofway width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width such transition shall occur along the front side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots for a reasonable distance and shall not occur within the street intersection itself in other words the rightofway width shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection 2 to the greatest extent possible the number of lots fronting along residential collector streets shall be minimized in order to ensure adequate traffic safety and efficiency no more than twenty 20 percent of the total centerline length of a collector street may have residential lots fronting onto the collector on each side of the street for example a collector street having a total centerline length from one 1 terminus to another of one thousand 1000 feet may have lots fronting onto it with a total frontage distance of two hundred 200 feet on each side of the street calculations shall be submitted with the construction plat application and provided to the director and city engineer verifying that lots fronting onto a collector street do not exceed the above g subdivisions abutting arterial streets where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street the city council may require marginal access streets reverse frontage lots which back onto the arterial deep lots with rear service alleys or such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of local traffic h reserve strips prohibited reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is required by the city and approved by the city council i intersections 1 intersecting undivided streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred and fifty 150 feet shall be avoided 2

rightofway widths shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan and as defined by the corresponding roadway crosssections on the thoroughfare plan and in the citys tcss manual k half streets construction of half streets shall be prohibited except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of these regulations and the thoroughfare plan and where the city council makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question the city council may also find that it would be more practical or cost effective to delay construction of the other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed if the property owner is responsible for onehalf  of the street then the property owner shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility including all applicable street appurtenances such as median openings left turn lanes into the development sidewalks with barrierfree ramps drainage structures etc

temporary turnaround bulb with the appropriate temporary street easement is provided at the end b a temporary deadend street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal culdesac and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like a culdesac as provided in k2 culdesac above the city engineer may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc or wing portions of the temporary turnaround bulb in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later on c a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any temporary
