freedom and justice center for prostitution resources minneapolis minnesota and from sexually oriented businesses an insiders view by david sherman presented to the michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law jan 12 200 and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the brigham city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments if any further there is presently no mechanism in this city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs 6 numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7 according to research from the kaiser family foundation an estimated 650000 to 900000 americans are infected with hiv the number of new hiv infections occurring each year is now about 41000 men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact 8 relevant statistics revealed that a total of 1893 aids cases had been reported in utah  9 the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that as many as 1 in 3 people with hiv do not know they are infected 41 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of us dept of health & human services 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretoforenonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of brigham city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity child pornography and to minors materials harmful to them  22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this ordinance 24 the barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to preclude the establishment of criminal enterprises within brigham city 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of brigham city will be promoted by the enactment of this

city council finds and establishes that one esu equals 3000 square feet of impervious surface area c calculation the city council finds that each singlefamily residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff therefore each developed singlefamily residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one 1 esu all other developed parcels including multiple family

a fee based on the actual amount of impervious surface on the parcel single family residential parcels will all be assessed a common fee based on the average amount of impervious surface area found on single family residential parcels in the city the city council finds that the common fee for single family residential parcels is justified because of the following 1 each single family residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff and  2 it would be impractical and difficult to administer the utility if each single family residential parcel were measured individually c the city council finds esus to be of the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm drain utility the city council establishes the amount of impervious surface included in each esu to be equal to the average amount of impervious surface found on single family residential parcels therefore each single family residential parcel will pay the fee for one esu storm drainage 8  obstruction a it is unlawful for any person to obstruct or contribute to the obstruction of the flow of storm water

wholly or partially within any sensitive area as identified by this shall receive comments and recommendations from city departments and other reviewing agencies as applicable  development standards for floodplain corridor lands 2 the flood hazard areas of brigham city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage a purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area b methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 2 1910 183 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally

all proposed new subdivisions or developments will be analyzed and rated for wildfire risk using the fire hazard severity scale developed by the state of utah division of state lands and forestry all of these factors can vary from development to development the composite score will categorize the hazard level of the proposed development once a proposed subdivision or development has been classified as to its hazard level development standards for each level can be used by the brigham city fire marshall to guide fire protection and wildfire prevention measures this rating shall be submitted to brigham city at the initial stage of a subdivision application as required by the fire marshall or as otherwise required in the processing of development permits for any proposed development the rating scale is based on five separate factors a slope  this factor is displayed as a percentage it is calculated by measuring the vertical distance and horizontal distance for a given area and dividing the vertical by the horizontal b aspect  this factor is the cardinal direction in which the surface of the ground faces c response time of fire agency  this factor is measured in minutes it takes the nearest responsible fire agency to respond to a fire in a given area d type of vegetation  this factor is categorized by fuel types rates of spread resistance to control and potential to cause structural damage are the criteria for rating severity e vegetation density  this factor is considered the total combustible vegetation that may be available as a fuel for wildfire 2 fuel breaksvegetation manipulation a hazardous fuels in the form of native vegetation will be cleared around structures and around the perimeter of the development to assist in wildfire prevention measures this fuel break is not intended as a complete vegetation clearing fire break fuel breaks must be in place prior to occupancy of the structure b the definition of a fuel break by the utah

on occasion and with increasing frequency received requests to site communications towers and antennas the purpose of this to 3 dated  4 dated  5 dated  6 dated  323 establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas the goals of this to i encourage the location of towers on public property and in nonresidential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the city ii encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sties iii encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal iv encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas and v enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout the city quickly effectively and efficiently accordingly the city council finds that the promulgation of this warranted and necessary a to manage the location of towers and antennas in the city and encourage the use of public property for the placement thereof  b to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers including support structure failure and falling ice  c to minimize adverse visual impacts of towers design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  d to accommodate the growing need for towers  e to promote and encourage shared usecolocation of existing and new towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future f to consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent allowed by the telecommunications act of 1996  g to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna support structure failure and falling ice proper siting of antenna support structure new uses all new antennas shall comply with this ordinance after the date of passage existing uses all towers existing on the date of passage of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply with the requirements of this industry site selection criteria in siting a new antenna the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the established network a general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority a topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service b availability of road access c availability of electric power d availability of landbased telephone lines or microwave link capability e leasable lands and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent with zoning regulations f screening potential of existing vegetation structures and topographic features g zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities h compatibility with adjacent land uses i the least number of sites to cover the desired area j the greatest amount of coverage consistent with physical requirements k opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact l availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting  city site selection criteria as a fundamental element of this the telecommunications company proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna on an existing structure is required to demonstrate using technological evidence that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to satisfy its function in the companys grid system further the company must demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the cell sites function within the grid system applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it is either an fcc licensed telecommunications provider or has in place agreements with an fcc licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure low power mobile radio service facilities should be located and designed to minimize any adverse effect they may have on residential property values sites should be placed in locations where 324 the existing topography vegetation buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening sites should be located on bare ground without visual mitigation only in md and mg districts based on the design standards articulated in this design of sites in all districts should consider the impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district in residential districts and residential land use areas the minimum lot size for commercial communications towers shall be three 3 acres  priorities the following establishes the order of priorities for locating new communications facilities a place antennas and towers on public property b place antennas and towers in districts zoned md or mg c place antennas and towers in districts zoned gc which do not adjoin or adversely impact residential neighborhoods d place antennas on appropriate existing structures such as buildings communications towers water towers and smokestacks in other zoned districts e place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property f place antennas and towers in 1 residential districts only if the installation is a small cell facility or7 locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in nonresidential districts  and 2 only on or in existing churches parks schools utility facilities or other public facilities an applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government structure a private institutional structure or other appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zoning district and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints and economic or technological feasibility no appropriate location is available the telecommunications company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a one 1 mile radius of
