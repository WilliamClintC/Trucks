how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with the 2009 republication a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code

dakota has in sdcl 936 and 71814 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city commission of the city of huron beadle county south dakota does ordain as follows the city of huron elects to comply with the requirements of the national flood insurance act of 1968 pl 90488 as amended the national flood insurance program established in the aforesaid act provides that areas of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the federal emergency management agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas    findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of huron are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage    statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and

the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions    methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to

variances 1 variances in general for the purposes of this chapter a variance is a granting of relief from the requirements of this chapter and the fema floodplain regulations because a variance can create an increased risk to life and property variances from flood elevation or other requirements in the flood ordinance should be rare granting variances is a local decision that must be based on local ordinances state law and nfip criteria a variances are based on the general criteria of the general principal of zoning law in that they pertain to a particular piece of property and are not
