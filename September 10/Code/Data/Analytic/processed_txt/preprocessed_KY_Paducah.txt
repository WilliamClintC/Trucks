and variances appeals and variance procedures a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this division would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this division are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b designation of variance and appeals board the board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this division c duties of variance and appeals board 1 the board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the city in the

community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5 necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6 availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges e conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this division the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division 1 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard the term minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build atgrade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this division  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in section 5041 under the term public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in section 5041 or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 7 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection d1 11 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the mccracken county court clerks office and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency g historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition section 5041 upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure h no impact certification within

the zoning district regulations for any case where parking in excess of the minimum requirement was provided on the original development plan that same number of spaces shall be provided in excess of the minimum requirement for the proposed minor amendment plan 2 procedures for minor amendments a filing to request approval of minor amendments to development plans the developer shall file with the

development plan generally such situations involve developments where placement of structures will be tightly controlled by the streets lot pattern and requirements for placement of structures within the zone and where the applicant sees fit to have plans prepared at the required level of detail for subdivision plats prior to receiving a zone change approval when an applicant is required to provide a development plan in conjunction with a zoning map amendment request the applicant may file a subdivision plat in place of the development plan if deemed appropriate by the city in any disputed case the city shall make the final judgment as to whether a development plan or a subdivision plat is required 4 administration the city manager shall designate the department andor city
