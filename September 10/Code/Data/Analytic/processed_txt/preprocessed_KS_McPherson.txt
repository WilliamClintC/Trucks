in such amounts and determined in such methods as are set forth in this section b except as noted each residential unit making a separate connection to the citys sanitary sewer system shall be assessed a sewer connection surcharge referred to in this section as the connection surcharge notwithstanding the above for any multifamily residential structures that have common legal ownership of such residential units the connection surcharge shall be assessed the connection surcharge per tap plus a unit fee multiplied by the number of units the connection surcharge and the unit fee shall be set from time to time by resolution of the governing body for purposes of determining the connection surcharge the term multifamily residential unit means a duplex triplex fourplex apartment apartment buildings or mobile home dwelling units but does not include a condominium or detached single family residence the connection surcharge and unit fee if any shall be due and payable at the time the residential unit is connected to the citys sanitary sewer system the connection surcharge shall be in addition to any other fees or charges payable upon connection to the citys sanitary sewer system c each nonresidential unit making a separate connection to the citys sanitary sewer system shall be assessed a nonresidential connection surcharge for purposes of this section the term nonresidential use includes manufacturing industrial commercial school or nonprofit organization users other than a residential use owned or operated by a commercial business or nonprofit organization for each nonresidential use the initial nonresidential connection surcharge shall be 75 percent of the base connection surcharge for a residential unit a second nonresidential connection surcharge shall be made 18 months after assessment of the initial connection surcharge the second nonresidential connection surcharge shall be an amount equal to $55000 for each 6700 gallons of water actually used on the premises on an average monthly basis during the 18month proveup period water use on the premises shall be determined by the records of the water department of the citys board of public utilities credit shall be given against the second surcharge for the amount previously paid as an initial connection surcharge any nonresidential user may install a sewer meter on the premises to measure the amount of water discharged into the citys sanitary sewer system if such a meter is installed and measures a discharge of water over at least 12 of the 18 months of the proveup period then the second connection surcharge shall be based on actual average monthly gallons of wastewater actually discharged into the citys sanitary sewer system during the proveup period d with respect to any nonresidential user the governing body may from time to time by resolution modify the connection surcharge set forth in an ordinance for any particular nonresidential user taking into account such matters as the quantity or quality of industrial waste discharged into the citys sanitary sewer system water consumed in a users industrial or manufacturing process or evaporated for cooling purposes and any other factor which may reasonably be determined to affect the quantity or quality of water discharged into the sanitary sewer system upon the enactment of such a resolution the connection surcharge for such industrial users shall be assessed as set forth in this section e for each separate new sewer connection to the citys sanitary sewer system for a user located outside the corporate limits of the city where the lot or tract of land or part thereof has not previously been assessed a connection surcharge the connection surcharge shall be 150 percent of the connection surcharge determined as otherwise set forth in this section f if the use of an installation previously connected to the citys sanitary sewer system changes so as to increase the rate of discharge of water into the citys sanitary sewer system the city may reclassify the user and assess an additional connection surcharge based upon the new classification an 18month proveup period shall be allowed after the reclassification during which period water use data shall be assembled as in the case of a new nonresidential user at the end of the proveup period the additional connection surcharge if any shall be due and payable credit shall be given against the amount calculated for the connection surcharge previously paid if a use is changed so that a smaller amount of water is discharged into the citys sanitary sewer system than under the previous use no refund of the previously paid connection surcharge shall be made a change in the volume or characteristics of wastewater discharged by any user may be determined to be a change in use g nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the ability of the city to enter into special contractual arrangements with new users for the payment of such connection surcharges or waive connection surcharges as the governing body may deem to be in the best interests of the citys sewer utility or the community at large h the final cost for connection surcharge shall be calculated and verified by the citys director of public works or by hisher designee after a request is made for a new sewer connection the director of public works may require a written application for sewer service identifying the name of the owner and legal description of the lot or tract of land to which sewer service is to be extended a description of the intended use of the property after the sewer connection is made the estimated volume of wastewater discharge to be made pursuant to such use any unusual characteristics of such wastewater and any other information deemed necessary in order to make a determination of the amount of the connection surcharge at such time as the director of public works has made a determination of the amount of the connection surcharge the owner of the property to be served will be rendered a bill for the amount of the connection surcharge or the initial payment if the proposed use is a nonresidential use if any owner or lessee of a lot or tract of land believes that the use of the property has been improperly characterized by the director of public works such owner or lessee may appeal such determination to the governing body the governing bodys action on any such appeal shall be final if a determination of the amount of the surcharge has not been made at the time of connection to the sanitary sewer system the owner shall pay the minimum connection surcharge for a residential or nonresidential use as the case may be and shall pay the balance upon receipt of a bill for such amount billings will be made only to the record owners of the properties to be served and if a connection is made before the entire connection surcharge is made then the city shall have a lien on the property served for the amount of the unpaid surcharge the city may perfect its lien by filing a notice of lien with the county register of deeds which notice must contain a legal description of the property subject to the lien the names of the record owners of the property the amount of the unpaid connection surcharge the date on which the billing for the connection surcharge was made and a reference to this section or the corresponding section of this it becomes necessary for the city to foreclose its lien the lien must be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mechanics and materialmans liens other than the statute of limitations for the filing of such actions which shall not apply to actions to foreclose the citys lien i payment of the connection surcharges imposed by this section shall ordinarily be due not later than the time of issuance of a building permit by the city the city inspector may withhold issuance of a building permit until all connection fees due have been paid in the case of a nonresidential user payment due at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be the initial connection surcharge j all connection surcharge payments received by the city shall be deposited in

unit development district herein referred to as a pud district is to encourage innovation in residential commercial andor industrial development by permitting greater variety and flexibility in type design and layout of buildings  2 to encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of land development  3 to encourage development which incorporates the best features of modern design while conserving the value of land  and 4 to provide a procedure which relates the type design and layout of residential commercial andor industrial development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values the pud district operates as an overlay zone in conjunction with all of the other districts in that it is necessary for an area to concurrently be zoned for one or more of the other districts in addition to the pud district designation a general provisions 1 the governing body may by ordinance approve the establishment of a pud district on any parcel or tract of land which is suitable for and of sufficient size to be planned and developed or redeveloped as a unit and in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations and with the comprehensive plan 2 a pud district may be established for a residential development or for a general development a development shall be deemed to be a residential development when it is limited to dwelling units in detached attached or clustered or multiplestoried structures or any combination thereof  and nonresidential uses of a religious cultural recreational and business character that are primarily designed and intended to serve the residents of the residential development a development shall be deemed to be a general development when it contains major business andor industrial structures and uses exclusively or when it blends residential structures or dwelling units in a unified plan with business andor industrial structures and uses 3 as a convenience for all references and filing purposes the specific name of the proposed development shall precede all references to is being a planned unit development district a preliminary planned unit development plan or a final planned unit development plan all amendments thereto shall be denoted by adding the word amended following the name of the development and before any reference to its status as a district or plan the letters pud shall serve as an acceptable abbreviation for the words planned unit development 4 any development that is proposing any of the following criteria shall be required to be established by approval of a pud district a to use multiple zoning classifications  b land uses or standards that would not otherwise be allowed in an existing zoning district  c innovation in a development but which will preserve property values in the area  454 d a development of such a large size andor intensity of land uses that in the opinion of the zoning administrator the design and processing of such a development would be facilitated by the establishment of a pud district  or e any combination of the above this does not preclude a developer from applying for a pud district even though these regulations do not require it b standards and criteria for planned unit developments 1 for all planned developments a a development plan of the site that is not inconsistent with the standards set out in this section or with such general policies or specific rules and regulations for pud districts as may be adopted from time to time by the planning commission or the governing body and placed on public record in the office of the city clerk shall prima facie be deemed to have qualified for preliminary approval no such policies rules or regulations shall be revised or added to which would be applicable to a specific proposal for a pud district after an application for preliminary approval of a specific pud plan has been filed a pud plan shall not be inconsistent with the following general standards for use of land and the use type bulk design and location of buildings the density or intensity of use the common open space the public facilities and the development by geographic division of the site 1 the pud district will not substantially injure or damage the use value and enjoyment of surrounding property nor hinder or prevent the development of surrounding property in accordance with the comprehensive plan 2 the site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development traffic control signals will be provided without expense to the city when it is determined that such signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets 3 the pud district will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities such as fire and police protection 4 the entire parcel of land to be occupied by the pud district shall be held by a single landowner or if there are two or more landowners the application for such district shall be filed jointly by all such landowners  however the holder of a contract to purchase or other person having an enforceable 455 proprietary interest in such land shall also be deemed a landowner for purposes of these regulations 5 the pud plan shall contain such proposed covenants easements and other provisions relating to the bulk location and density of residential buildings nonresidential uses and structures and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the pud district and are not inconsistent with the best interests of the area such covenants easements and other provisions if part of the pud plan as finally approved may be modified removed or released only with the consent of the governing body after a public hearing before and recommendations by the planning commission as provided in c all such covenants shall specifically provide for enforcement by the city in addition to the landowners within the development 6 the planning commission may designate divisible geographic units of the entire parcel of land to be developed as a unified plan in the case of residential pud plans and general pud plans which contain residential buildings the planning commission may permit in each unit deviations from the number of dwelling units per acre established for the entire plan  provided that such deviation shall be adjusted for in other units of the plan so that the number of dwelling units per acre authorized for the entire pud plan is not affected 7 for all business and industrial uses proposed for development within the plan the standards and extent of uses shall not exceed the least restrictive requirements for the specific use as provided for in the business and industrial districts of these zoning regulations unless they meet the provisions of b 1a12 and 4107c9 8 the location and arrangement of structures parking areas walks lighting and appurtenant

finds that such specifications are not required in the interests of the residents or occupants of the planned development and that the waiver or modification of such specifications for pud plans would not be inconsistent with the interests of the city the commission shall require guarantees for required public improvements and the filing of comparable engineering and survey data on final development plans 12 any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the site shall be warranted by the design of the pud plan and the amenities incorporated in it and shall not be inconsistent with the interest of the public generally 2 standards for residential planned developments and general planned developments containing residential buildings a any pud plan that does not propose to increase the number of dwelling units per acre that would otherwise be permitted on the property under the maximum zoning regulations otherwise applicable thereto in the underlying districts which permit residences shall be prima facie qualified for preliminary approval insofar as residential density is concerned a pud plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would be permitted by these district regulations otherwise applicable to the site but if the number of dwelling units per acre exceeds by more than 10% of that permitted by the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the site the developer has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property the planning commission in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public services to be achieved by 1 the amount location and proposed use of common open spaces  and 2 the location design and type of dwelling units the planning commission shall also consider that the physical characteristics of the site may make increased densities appropriate in the particular location in addition to establishing a maximum density the plan shall specify either the minimum number 457 of dwelling units and commercial or industrial uses or the minimum acreage allowances for each specific pud district b when common open space is provided in a pud plan the amount and location of such common open space shall be consistent with the declared type of development as described in a2

interest of the pud plan or of the city if the city finds it necessary to carry out the obligations required to maintain the open space in order to avoid having it become a public nuisance the costs shall be assessed against the properties within the development and shall become a tax lien on said properties see for definition of common open space c when a pud plan includes common open space such common open space shall never be used for the construction of any structure nor shall such open space ever be computed as a part of the required minimum lot area or any required yard of any other

regulations 5 is the request caused by changed or changing conditions in the area of the subject property and if so what is the nature and significance of such changed or changing conditions 6 do adequate sewage disposal and water supply and all other necessary public facilities including street access exist or can they be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the subject property 7 would the subject property need to be platted or replatted or in lieu of dedications made for rightsofway easements access control or building setback lines 8 would a screening plan be necessary for existing andor potential uses of the subject property 9 are suitable vacant lands or buildings available for development that currently have the same zoning as is requested 10 if the request is for business or industrial uses are such uses needed to provide more services or employment opportunities 116 11 is the subject property suitable for the current zoning to which it has been restricted 12 to what extent would the removal of the restrictions ie the approval of the zoning change or special use request detrimentally affect other property in the neighborhood 13 would the request be consistent with the purpose of the zoning district classification and the intent and purpose of these regulations 14 is the request in conformance with the comprehensive plan and does it further enhance the implementation of the plan 15 what is the nature of the support or opposition to the request 16 are there any informational materials or recommendations available from knowledgeable persons or experts which would be helpful in its evaluation 17 by comparison does the relative gain to the public health safety and general welfare outweigh the loss in value or the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not approving the request of those factors considered as relevant to the requested change in zoning district classification or boundary not all factors need to be given equal consideration by the commission in deciding upon its recommendation  note all the factors stated in the decision of golden v city of overland park 224 kan 591 584 p 2d 130 1978 are included in this list in using these factors as guidelines modifications may be made in the criteria to more specifically relate them to the particular zoning change in classification or special use 117 101 special uses because of particular factors associated with their activities certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts but are allowed as special uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional conditions such as to make the use considered compatible with the surrounding property the neighborhood and the zoning district in granting a special use the minimum requirements of approval for all similar types of permitted uses in the same district must be met unless otherwise reduced by a specific reference in these regulations the requirements may be made more stringent if there is potentially injurious effects which may be anticipated upon other property and the neighborhood or contrary to the welfare and convenience of the public such additional conditions may include but are not limited to requirements affecting the lot size or yard dimensions  changing street width  the extent and location of entrance or exit drives  controlling the size location and number of signs  the period and time of operation  lot

comparability for zoning districts in accordance with provisions provided for in ksa 12757b and in e6 of the zoning regulations of the city of mcpherson kansas the mcpherson city planning commission hereby establishes a table of comparability for zoning districts as listed below this table designates the zoning districts which are considered to be lesser changes due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the zoning regulations when considering zoning district amendments the planning commission and the governing body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below  provided however that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser classification than the existing zoning district if the applicant at the governing body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the application andor the governing body desires to consider a lesser zoning change then such a proposed change shall be returned to the planning commission for reconsideration and further recommendation to the governing body without further publication or notice as provided for in ksa 12757c and in of the zoning regulations most restrictive a1 agricultural transition district r1 singlefamily residential district r2 twofamily residential district r3 multiplefamily residential district b1 office business district b2 neighborhood business district b4 service business district i1 light industrial district least restrictive i2 heavy industrial district because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the mh1 manufactured home subdivision district mh2 manufactured home park district b3 central business district b3a main street district b5 shopping center business district b6 interchange business district and pud planned unit development district serve these districts are excluded from the table of comparability although the notification for a special use is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment it is not an actual change in zoning districts and therefore the table of comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different use even if in the same zoning district the property considered for a special use however may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without renotification example if an application is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from r1 singlefamily residential district to i1 light industrial district the planning commission may recommend the lesser ie more restrictive b1 or b2 business districts without republication or mailing of new notices a2 if an application however is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from the existing b1 office business district to the i1 light industrial district the recommending of the lesser r2 or r3 residential districts shall not be valid without
