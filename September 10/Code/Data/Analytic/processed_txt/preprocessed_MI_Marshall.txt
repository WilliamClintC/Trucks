the city of marshall requirements including but not limited to all rules and regulations pertaining to site plan approval and building permit approval passed 442016  5402 findings the city finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health safety and welfare because athe addition of impervious surfaces alters the natural hydrologic cycle increasing peak flows and total stormwater runoff volume this scenario results in environmental degradation flooding channel erosion pollution and ultimately increases the cost of maintaining drainage infrastructure downstream of a development bimproper collection and conveyance of stormwater adversely affects offsite property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding which can endanger property and human life cincreased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems that decrease their hydraulic capacity and increases the likelihood of pollution in our rivers dstormwater runoff contains numerous pollutants such as heavy metals dangerous bacteria from animal excrement nitrogen and phosphorus all of which adversely impact downstream water bodies and endanger the health of humans and other living organisms ethe city has adopted a master plan that establishes proposed land use and infrastructure service needs for undeveloped areas of the city finadequate soil erosion and sedimentation control practices can cause increased turbidity the cloudiness caused by having soil particles suspended in the water column passed 442016  5403 objectives it is the

or complete may relieve the property owner from strict compliance of this chapter reasonable conditions may be imposed as part of such a grant the director shall be guided by the primary goal of protecting the waters of the state without creating undue hardship upon the property owners affected bin determining whether to grant a variance and conditions to impose the director shall be guided

sites any additional stormwater imperviousness shall generally be offset to the extent defined by the swmp however to be consistent with the goals of this chapter redevelopment is also generally expected to result in increased environmental protection whenever the overall site is not currently performing to these swmp therefore in determining whether to grant a variance and the conditions to impose for a reconstruction project the director shall be guided by seeking a minimum 20% improvement over existing conditions for water quality or water volume or both dany person receiving a notice

modify the decision being appealed such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the zoning board of appeals decision fin considering all such appeals the director may grant a variance from the terms of this chapter so as to provide relief in whole or in part from the action being appealed but only upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied 1the application of the chapter provisions being appealed will present or cause unreasonable difficulties for a facility  and 2the granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent the goals and purposes sought to be

located are not detrimental to the neighborhood where the activity or structure has been in use for many years and long accepted an extension or expansion of such uses may in some cases not be detrimental to the neighborhood further it is recognized that the continuation of a preexisting nonconforming use as it presently exists may be quite detrimental to the neighborhood but could be voluntarily changed to some other use by the property owner which although not a use allowable in the zoning district would be considerably less offensive than the present use  and therefore a
