introduction this report outlines the citys water conservation and drought contingency programs the objective of the conservation program is to reduce the quantity required for each water using activity as is practical implementation of efficient water practices the drought contingency program provides procedures for voluntary and mandatory actions to be put in place upon the citys water supply system during a water shortage emergency drought contingency procedures include a prohibition of certain uses both programs are tools that the city will have available to operate effectively in all situations o201912   1exh 4919 planning area and project description the city of weatherford is located in southeast parker county the water and wastewater service area is defined by the citys certificate of convenience and necessity ccn boundary presently only a small percentage of the citys water and wastewater customers are located outside the citys corporate limits the citys current service area is approximately 2896 square miles but the potential service area including the ccn and city limits measures approximately 443 square miles o201912   1exh 4919 utility profile a detailed summary of utility evaluation data is included in appendix a this data substantiates the need for implementing a water conservation program along with other improvements o201912   1exh 4919 water conservation goalsfive and tenyear targets the objective of a water conservation plan is to reduce the per capita consumption of water a finite resource many communities throughout the united states have used conservation measures to successfully cope with various water and wastewater problems reductions in water use of as much as 25 percent have been achieved but the normal range is five percent to 15 percent the goals established in the previous plan included a five percent reduction in the first five years and an additional two and onehalf percent reduction in the next five years annual water consumption for both total retail usage and residential usage is shown in the following graph to average out weather patterns staff compared fiveyear averages in lieu of individual year comparisons the fiveyear average in 2013 was 160 gallons per capita per day gpcd for total retail consumption by 201 the fiveyear average was 136 gpcd which amounts to a 15 percent reduction over the last five years it is worth noting that the texas water development board and the water conservation implementation task force recommended a goal of 140 gpcd for retail water consumption during this same period the residential use decreased from 79 gpcd to 64 gpcd which amounts to a 19 percent reduction it is the goal of this water conservation plan to reduce overall retail per capita water consumption by an additional two and onehalf percent within five years of adopting this plan and an additional 25% within ten years for a total of five years because of the already low residential per capita usage the goal is to reduce residential consumption by one percent within the next five years and an additional one percent within ten years for a total of two percent these targets will be achieved by tracking water use control of water loss continuing water conservation education programs and literature and implementation of the reclaimed water program in an effort to minimize real and apparent water loss in the distribution system meters are installed at dead end mains during flushing to calculate water loss all water meters were replaced with more accurate meters as part of the

subdivision design standards proportionality appeal a purpose applicability and effect 1 purpose the purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the citys public facilities systems 2 applicability an appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirements to dedicate land to construct improvements or to pay development fees other than impact fees for a public infrastructure improvement which requirement is imposed under the citys subdivision regulations to a plat application pursuant to this chapter whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards or is imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision b proportionality determination by city engineer prior to a decision by the planning and zoning board on a preliminary plat application or if no preliminary plat application is required on a final plat application filed under this chapter the city engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the citys public facilities systems taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed 1 in making his proportionality determination the city engineer may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to onsite improvements including minimum infrastructure sizes specified in the citys tcss manual  the proposed or potential use of the land  the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities  impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the citys public facilities systems  the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development  the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments  the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements  any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible  or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the citys public facilities systems 2 based upon his proportionality determination the city engineer shall affirm that the public infrastructure improvement requirements of the subdivision regulations do not impose costs on the developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the city in providing public facilities to serve the development 3 the city engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination required by

preliminary plat application of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with subsection f traffic impact analysis which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property in the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed the city council may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this section for additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed preliminary plat in the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project the city may require an update of the study for each subsequent phase of the development that reflects any applicable changed conditions if the preliminary plat is in conformance with the thoroughfare plan and if the preliminary plat is for a development of less than 50 dwelling units or for a development generating less than 500 oneway trips per day then a traffic impact analysis is not required 4 approach roads and access all subdivisions must have at least two points of vehicular access primarily for emergency vehicles and must be connected via improved roadways to the citys improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth requirements for dedication of rightofway and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis a two points of vehicular access shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two improved roads accessing the subdivision from the citys improved thoroughfare system and the subdivision has at least two road entrances the city council may at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise public safety or impede emergency access accept a single mediandivided entrance from the citys improved thoroughfare system provided that the median extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least 200 feet to an intersecting internal street which provides at least two routes to the interior of the subdivision for example the entrance street is not a deadend or culdesac and it does not create a bottleneck allowing only one emergency route into the interior of the subdivision also see section 1131u b the subdivision

in which case the full rightofway width shall be provided or unless there is some other compelling reason to require more than half of the rightofway width such as avoiding the infringement upon or demolition of existing structures avoiding crossing a creek or flood plain or some other obstacle or other similar circumstance in some instances more than half of the required width shall be required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual or proposed alignment of the street such as in the case of a curved street as may be required by the city council b perimeter streets where an existing halfstreet is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition the other half of the street shall be dedicated and an appropriate amount of the street shall be improved by the developer of the new subdivision or addition c slope easements the dedication of easements in addition to dedicated rightsofway shall be required whenever due to topography additional width is

streets and any associated property as public streets and rightofway upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership however in no event shall the city be obligated to accept said streets as public should the city elect to accept the streets as public then the city has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the citys acceptance of the streets the city shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed the city may also require at the associations or the lot owners expense the removal of any guard houses access control devices landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot or within any other common area f

condition of the private streets out of any use of access gates or cross arms or out of any use of the subdivision by the city or governmental or utility entity d escrow policies and procedures 1 request for escrow whenever this ordinance requires a property owner to construct a street or thoroughfare or other type of public improvement the property owner may if there exists unusual circumstances such as a timing issue due to pending roadway improvements by another agency such as txdot or parker county that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing petition the city to construct the street or thoroughfare usually at a later date in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section if more than one street or thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy requirements for roadways as demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis the city managermayor or designee may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be accepted and require the deposit of all funds attributable to the development in escrow accounts for one or more of such affected roadways the city council shall review the particular circumstances involved a traffic impact analysis may be required to facilitate the city councils deliberations on the matter and shall determine at its sole discretion whether or not provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owners obligation to construct the street or thoroughfare with his or her development 2 escrow deposit with the city whenever the city council agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under this ordinance the property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the city an amount equal to his or her share of the costs of design construction permits reviews and approvals inspections any additional land acquisition and an appropriate and realistic inflation factor to ensure that the actual future dollar costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in the future such amount shall be reviewed and approved by the city managermayor or designee and by the city engineer and shall be paid prior to release of engineering plans by the city engineer the obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owners transferees successors and assigns  and the liability therefore shall be joint and several 3 determination of escrow amount the amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the maximum comparable turnkey bid price of construction of the improvements including design permits reviews and approvals inspections and any additional land acquisition that may be needed such determination of the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city managermayor or designee and the city engineer 4 termination of escrow escrows or portions of escrowed amounts which have been placed with the city under this section and which have been held for a period of ten years from the date of such payment or agreement in the event that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made shall upon written request be returned to the property owner along with onehalf of its accrued interest such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for 5 refund if any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements in the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority the difference between the property owners actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds including accrued interest if any shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements 6 interest limitation if money is refunded within six months of deposit only the principal will be refunded monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued calculated at one percent less than the rate

developments holding valid unexpired building permits at level of service c or above 8 effect of adequacy determination if the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in subsection 1131f1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereto the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions a the deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed  b a reduction in the density or intensity of development  c the dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein  or d any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such development g arrangement of streets not shown on the thoroughfare plan for streets that are not shown on the citys thoroughfare plan such as local residential streets the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall 1 provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas  2 conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the city council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical  3 provide for future access such as by stubbing streets for future extension to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or for a similar type of land use  and 4 not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings including those on the other side of an existing or planned mediandivided arterial in which case new streets shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared h residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by will be discouraged such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions 1 wherever the rightofway width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width such transition shall occur along the front side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots for a reasonable distance and shall not occur within the street intersection itself in other words the rightofway width shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection 2 to the greatest extent possible the number of lots fronting along residential collector streets shall be minimized in order to ensure adequate traffic safety and efficiency no more than 20 percent of the total centerline length of a collector street may have residential lots fronting onto the collector on each side of the street for example a collector street having a total centerline length from one terminus to another of 1000 feet may have lots fronting onto it with a total frontage distance of 200 feet on each side of the street calculations shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application and provided to the city planner and city engineer verifying that lots fronting onto a collector street do not exceed the above 3 at least 50 percent of the total centerline length of all streets including collector streets within a residential subdivision or within each phase of a residential subdivision unless otherwise approved by city council to apply to the subdivision in its entirety rather than each individual phase shall be curvilinear in design calculations shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application and provided to the city planner and city engineer verifying that the above curvilinear street requirement is being met i where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street the city council may require marginal access streets reverse frontage lots which back onto the arterial deep lots with rear service alleys or such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of local traffic j reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is required by the city and approved by the city council k intersecting undivided streets with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided intersecting streets onto an existing or future divided roadway must be configured such that the centerline offset will accommodate the appropriate median opening and leftturn lanes with required transition and stacking distances on each divided roadway and shall be aligned with any existing or proposed streets or driveways on the opposite side of the divided roadway in order to share the median opening l a street intersection with a major thoroughfare shall be at a 90degree angle and shall be tangent to the intersecting street for at least 100 feet all other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at a ninetydegree angle or radial to the centerline of the intersecting street for the full rightofway of the intersecting street and tangent to the intersecting street for at least 50 feet no street shall intersect at an angle that is less than 85 degrees m street rightofway widths shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan and as defined by the corresponding roadway crosssections on the thoroughfare plan and in the citys tcss manual n construction of half streets shall be prohibited except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of this ordinance and the thoroughfare plan and where the city council makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question the city council may also find that it would be more practical or cost effective to delay construction of the other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed if the property owner is responsible for onehalf of the street then the property owner shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility including all applicable street appurtenances such as median openings left turn lanes into the development sidewalks with barrierfree ramps drainage structures etc unless the city participates in the construction of the facility whenever a partial street has been previously platted along a common property line the other portion of the street rightofway shall be dedicated such that the rightofway is increased

a looped street shall be 1600 feet and the minimum length of any block or street segment shall be 400 feet as measured along the street centerline and between the points of intersection with other but not deadend or culdesac streets p a culdesac street shall not be longer than 600 feet and at the closed end shall have a turnaround bulb with an outside pavement diameter of at least 80 feet and a rightofway diameter of at least 100 feet the length of a culdesac shall be measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the culdesac bulb q the commission may recommend and the city council may approve waiverssuspensions for overlength streets or culsdesac whether temporary or permanent upon considering the following 1 alternative designs which would reduce street or culdesac length  2 the effect of overlength streets upon access congestion delivery of municipal services and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in traveling to and from their homes  and 3 means of mitigation including but not limited to additional midblock street connections limitation on the number of lots to be served along an overlength street segment or culdesac temporary or permanent points of emergency access and additional fire protection measures r except in unusual cases no deadend streets will be approved unless such deadend streets are provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land in the case of deadend streets which will eventually be extended into the adjacent subdivision no more than one lot per side can front onto the deadend street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb with the appropriate temporary street easement is provided at the end a temporary deadend street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal culdesac and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like a culdesac as provided in subsection p above the city engineer may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc or wing portions of the temporary turnaround bulb in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later on a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any temporary deadend streets if any that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub such as on the barricade also stating that the street will be extended in the future signage and lettering must be large enough to be legible by a person with normal vision at a 20foot distance any required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat along with their appropriate recording information if they are offsite or established by separate instrument s new streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets and shall be dedicated at equal or greater rightofway widths than the existing streets for an appropriate transition length if applicable t construction of new streets all new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the tcss of the city of weatherford at the time at which the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application u points of access all subdivisions shall have at least two points of access from improved public roadways also see

sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the downgrading of

activities that occur on their premises 6 the city council finds based in part upon the results of the survey of fort worth and dallas appraisers september 200 that sexually oriented businesses that engage in only retail sales or rental of sexually oriented adult merchandise for off premise use have adverse effects on surrounding property values and the ability of surrounding properties to sell
