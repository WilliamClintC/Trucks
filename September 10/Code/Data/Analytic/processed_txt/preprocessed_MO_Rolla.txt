and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 4 the number of cases of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases has been on the rise or remain at high levels in the united states 5 the findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns by establishing that sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the public interest and to address substantial governmental concerns 6 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is managed in a way consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the general public it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 7 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 8 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 9 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 10 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in conduct that this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 11 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license as been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this 12 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 13 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of rolla missouri will be promoted by the enactment of this      return

noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the city engineer  upset for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c below are met a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  the facility was the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and the user has submitted the following information to the city engineer

fails  prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in a of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in b3 f of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  bypass for the purposes of this section bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c if a user knows in advance of need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the city engineer at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible a user shall submit oral notice to the city engineer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five s days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the city engineer may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours bypass is prohibited and the city engineer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or sever property damage  there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section the city engineer may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the city engineer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph d of this section  pretreatment charges and fees the city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the citys pretreatment program which may include fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications  fees for monitoring
