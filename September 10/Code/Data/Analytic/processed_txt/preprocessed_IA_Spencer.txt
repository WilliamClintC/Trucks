commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community 2 these losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood and the cumulative effect of floodplain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and floodwater velocities
