by or as a result of stormwater discharges to rivers lakes reservoirs and streams in order to attain federal water quality standards  2 require that new development redevelopment and all land conversion activities maintain the natural hydrologic characteristics of the land in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion siltation property damage and the integrity of aquatic habitats and stream channels  3 prevent the discharge of pollutants including hazardous chemicals into stormwater runoff  4 minimize the volume and rate of stormwater which is discharged to rivers streams reservoirs lakes and combined sewers that flow from any site during construction and following development and reduce stream channel erosion caused by increased runoff  5 promote proper management of land to minimize the impacts of erosion and sedimentation  6 require postdevelopment runoff volume and quality to be equivalent to or an improvement on predevelopment runoff conditions by reducing runoff volumes increasing infiltration and improving runoff water quality  7 provide for the recharge of groundwater aquifers and maintain the base flow of streams  8 encourage the use of low impact development lid practices such as reducing impervious cover treating and infiltrating stormwater at the source utilizing environmentally sensitive site design and the preservation of open space and
