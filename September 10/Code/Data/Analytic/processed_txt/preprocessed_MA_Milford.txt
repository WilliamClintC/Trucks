several occasions in addition some newer provisions by covering the whole subject to which they relate have by implication served to repeal earlier provisions moreover by accepting certain state statutes the provisions of which are inconsistent with certain provisions of these bylaws the town has rendered the effect of those provisions null and void this is also true in instances where subsequent enactments of the state legislature either provide a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the subject matter also covered by these bylaws or are otherwise inconsistent with them the following compilation of the general bylaws of the town of milford contains editorial notes which reflect the dates of subsequent amendments and those provisions which have been repealed by implication or otherwise in certain instances editorial corrections and additions have been supplied so that the bylaws can be more readily understood such wording is set forth in parentheses   finally the 1959 compilation of these bylaws contain certain inaccuracies not in the text but in the numbering of the articles of the bylaws as such certain amendments by referring to the 1959 compilation would appear to refer to provisions which had not in fact been adopted this compilation places those amendments in the proper relationship to the bylaws as originally adopted in 192 and an

terms provided that such colocation does not materially interfere with the transmission andor reception of communication signals to or from the existing wireless communication link and provided that there are no structural or other physical limitations that make it impractical to accommodate the proposed additional wireless communication equipment or fixtures and subject to all other provisions of this bylaw  in the event that a wireless communication provider seeks to colocate upon such wireless communication link and is unable to do so because of unreasonable delay or commercially unreasonable terms or conditions imposed by the permit holder such provider may request for a determination by the special permit granting authority as to whether the colocation condition has been violated if the special permit granting authority after holding a public hearing which provides the permit holder with an opportunity to be heard decides that such colocation condition has been
