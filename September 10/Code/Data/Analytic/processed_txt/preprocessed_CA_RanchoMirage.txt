outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  variance procedure  variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration or federal emergency management agency     conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iii and iv of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and do not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter    preservation of security in existing gated communities  purpose and intent the purpose of this chapter is to

chapter has a direct substantial and significant impact upon the aesthetic appearance of our city therefore there is a need for further control over the lack of utilization condition and appearance of such facilities b the county fire protection district in pursuit of protection of the health and safety of the community requires that after underground storage tanks used for flammable or combustible liquids are taken out of service for a period of ninety days such tanks must be properly disposed of by removal or by being permanently filled when the required action is completed the service station is rendered unusable c closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting a nonuse cannot reasonably be utilized for the purposes originally established because the cost of restoring filled fuel tanks or replacing fuel tanks is excessive d the existence of closed vacant and inoperative automobile service station sites constituting nonuse is injurious or dangerous to the public health safety comfort and welfare of the community in that such conditions invite unsightliness blight fire hazards infestation decreasing values to surrounding properties and vandalism and the

monitoring and reporting  general of the public resources modified by assembly bill ab 3180 cortese bill requires all public agencies to establish monitoring or reporting procedures for mitigation measures included in environmental impact reports or negative declarations which are necessary to mitigate potential environmental impacts below a level of significance the mitigation monitoring law is the requirement to monitor the implementation of adopted mitigation measures for approved projects and report the results of that monitoring while ab 3180 describes this requirement as monitoring or reporting this chapter assumes that it would be of limited usefulness to monitor projects without reporting or to report without verification this chapter establishes the procedures necessary to carry out this state mandate  1990  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish a mitigation monitoring and reporting program for the city and to achieve the following provisions set out in of this chapter  1990  definitions a monitoring refers to the process of overseeing how a mitigation measure is adequately implemented of periodic onsite inspections verifying proper implementation by city departments responsible agencies and project consultants this oversight function ensures that all mitigation measures for a project are incorporated into the construction andor grading plan and are being properly implemented as adopted by the city council monitoring is also an aid in tracking construction phases and postoccupancy activities b reporting refers to the documentation of the status of mitigation measures to date and of field results derived from onsite monitoring by city departments responsible agencies and project consultants the mitigation measure checklist contained in this chapter as a main component of the program shall provide feedback information regarding the status of mitigation measures implementation and their effectiveness for the public and the decision makers benefit reporting also refers to a requirement conditions of approval of the project applicant or consultant to document monitoring efforts regarding implementation of adopted mitigation measures and provide the appropriate city departments or other agencies with compliance reports containing such information reports which identify the progress completion or violations of the implementation of mitigation measures shall be verified by a city representative and filed in accordance with the established project program  1990  application and exemptions pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa a program shall be established for every discretionary project approved by the city council which is subject to the adoption of either a negative declaration or an environmental impact report which includes mitigation measures necessary to reduce potentially significant environmental impacts below a level of significance for all projects subject to this chapter the program requirement specifics must be developed and approved after project approval by the city council and prior to issuance of a grading andor building permit the requirement does not apply to exempt projects or to negative declarations based upon an initial study finding of no significant impacts  1990  responsibilities a the city council is the final approval authority of all projects subject to a program the program requirements will be adopted by the city council as a condition of the project approval and carried out administratively by city staff the city council will also serve as the ultimate authority for project appeals major modifications and enforcement actions for noncompliance with the established program requirements and with adopted mitigation measures andor conditions of approval for a particular project b the planning commission shall hear projects undertaking a major modification review and responsibility will be only an advisory capacity for those projects for which the city council has final decision making authority c the director of community development or designee shall be responsible for assuring compliance with the provisions contained in a project program the director may delegate duties and responsibilities to other city representatives applicants consultants trustee agencies or any other responsible agency as necessary to make certain project completion and use is consistent with the purpose and intent of the program city procedures ordinances and state laws the director shall assure that required monitoring reports are filed and identified program violations are corrected when project modifications or changes are proposed during construction the director shall determine that the changes require a project minor or major modification review and whether subsequent environmental mitigation measures are necessary d other city staff city staff shall procedures assist the director in assuring compliance of adopted
