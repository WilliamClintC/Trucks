it is the intent of the city to address the unique problems associated with rave clubs by implementing rave club regulations and to protect juveniles and adults from criminal activity that occurs at such rave clubs b titusville hereby asserts that the following purposes of the rave club regulations set forth herein are matters of legitimate substantial and compelling governmental interests 1 to protect juveniles and adults from illegal drug activity including use sale and drug abuse such as overdoses and to reduce if not eliminate such activity from occurring in rave clubs  2 to protect juveniles and adults from criminal activity occurring in rave clubs 3 to protect juveniles and adults from predatorytype sexual crimes and acts occurring in rave clubs  4 to reduce the amount of criminal activity occurring in rave clubs predominantly in the latenight and earlymorning hours by prohibiting rave clubs from operating during the latenight and earlymorning hours  and 5 to prevent eliminate or at least reduce the deleterious effects of noise traffic and debris on residential and commercial property near rave clubs that occurs in the latenight and earlymorning hours  findings of fact the city finds and determines as factual matters the following 1 latenight and allnight rave clubs and similar forums of assembly commonly or sometimes referred to as raves are frequently sites for the sale possession and use of illicit drugs  2 rave clubs expose juveniles and adults to illegal drug activity and such exposure to drug activity is found to result often in drug addiction drug overdoses and death of juveniles and adults  3 rave clubs are often sites for criminal activity  4 rave clubs expose drug activity to the uninitiated youth of the city and such exposure to drug activity occurring at such raves is often found to result in drug addiction overdose and death of both juveniles and adults  5 rave clubs provide an arena for predatorytype sexual crimes thus for the protection of the citys youth juveniles should not congregate in such social settings with adults  additionally regulation of rave clubs is also necessary for the protection of adult victims of such crimes  6 criminal activity occurring at rave clubs takes place predominantly in the latenight and earlymorning hours  7 the actions of rave club patrons entering and exiting rave clubs can have an adverse impact on nearby residential and commercial properties in terms of excessive noise traffic and debris and such impacts are exacerbated by the fact that rave club patrons enter and exit such

definitions and rules of construction generally  12 findings the city council hereby makes the following findings 1 the professional engineering and management analysis submitted to the city properly defines the stormwater management needs of the city 2 given these needs it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the conservation management maintenance protection control use and enhancement of stormwater in the city in concert with other water resource management programs 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future stormwater management needs of the community the stormwater management needs generally include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management services and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to all property owners within the city in a variety of ways 4 the city presently owns and operates a stormwater management system which has been developed over a number of years the future usefulness of that system and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively conserve manage protect control use and enhance stormwater and water resources generally in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program 5 formation of a stormwater management utility  establishment of a separate enterprise fund for accounting of stormwater management program revenues expenditures assets and liabilities earnings and obligations  and adoption of various stormwater management rates fees charges rentals fines and penalties are necessary to meet the needs identified in the professional engineering and management analysis 21a1 111390 creation pursuant to the home rule power of article viii 2b florida constitution fs ch 166 and fs   the city does hereby establish a stormwater management utility the utility shall be responsible for the citys stormwater management program and system and for all activities and facilities necessary to provide control of stormwater quantity and quality in the city 21a2 111390 enterprise fund account there is hereby established a stormwater management utility enterprise fund which shall be used solely for the independent and separate accounting of all revenues expenditures assets and liabilities earnings and obligations of the stormwater management utility unless otherwise specifically authorized by the city council ordinance the revenues and other assets of the stormwater management utility shall be used only for the conservation management protection

public stormwater systems to collect control convey store detain retain recharge and treat stormwater and of stormwater management systems on private property it shall be the longterm objective of the city to provide a comparable and consistent level of stormwater service to similarly situated properties service area 21a5 111390 general financing and service charge rate policy it shall be the policy of the city that funding for stormwater management be equitably derived which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands imposed on the citys stormwater systems and programs the level of service provided and benefits realized as a result of the provision of adequate stormwater management services and facilities service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities the cost of stormwater services and facilities may include operating capital improvement and reserve expenses and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements similarlysituated properties shall pay similar charges service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the citys use of other stormwater management funding mechanisms including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees special fees for services fees in lieu of regulatory requirements impact fees system development charges and special assessments so as to accomplish the citys overall objective of equitable funding 21a6 111390 service charges the city council hereby establishes stormwater management utility service charges which shall be billed to all properties in the city except as specific exemptions allowed in this article or in future ordinances or amendments to this article shall apply the stormwater management utility service charges may include a service rate charge applied to each property related generally to the amount and quality of runoff discharged to the public stormwater systems and stormwater receiving waters a base rate charge for certain costs of service common to all stormwater management utility accounts and special service charges to persons entities or properties which require services andor facilities not commonly needed by all persons entities or properties 1 the service rate charge shall be reflective of the cost of providing services and facilities to properly control stormwater runoff quantity and quality the two 2 most important factors in the citys present cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities to individual properties are a the size of each property b its intensity of development 2 special service charges shall be structured to recover the cost of providing to certain persons entities and properties stormwater management services that are not commonly required by all stormwater service charge ratepayers such services may include but are not limited to private development plan review and inspection site inspections to verify the operational condition of onsite stormwater management systems such as private detentionretention and conveyance facilities monitoring and mitigative activities related to conditions on individual properties which impact water quality and actions to abate conditions on private properties which do not comply with adopted city standards andor which interfere with proper stormwater management and have been designated by the city manager or a duly authorized representative of the city manager to constitute a public nuisance 21a7 111390   71100   82217 service rate charges a the city finds and determined that a typical singlefamily residential property in the city is approximately eleven thousand 11000

has made contractual commitments to complete structures or deliver title thereto or occupancy thereof and the dates of and amounts of money involved in said commitment 8 whether prior to the date the comprehensive plan or land development regulation became pending the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution which the applicant will be unable to meet and whether it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet the new regulations and therefore should be permitted to proceed with the previously permitted type density or intensity of development 9 whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or any land development regulation claimed to defeat the applicants right to develop a parcel of land will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability 10 whether the applicant has a vested right to commence and complete only a portion of a proposed development on all or a portion of the applicants parcel of land 11 that the applicant owned an interest in the parcel of land proposed to be developed on the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation and that the specific type density or intensity of development proposed for the parcel of land was lawful and permitted at that time 12 whether the applicant has continuously owned the parcel of land since the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city council on the special permit application 13 whether requiring that the applicants parcel of land be developed in accordance with the currently effective city comprehensive plan or city land development regulation restrictions will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of
