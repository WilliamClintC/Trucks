and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is a error in any requirement decision or determination made by the kent planning and zoning commission in the enforcement or administration of this regulation a in considering such appeal the zoning board of appeals shall consider all factors it determines relevant including but not limited to 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed construction to flood damage  4 the importance of the services
