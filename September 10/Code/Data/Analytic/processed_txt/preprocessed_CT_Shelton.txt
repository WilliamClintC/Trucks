other districts whenever the water pollution control authority shall determine that the cost of a sewer will exceed the benefit to the area to be sewered immediately and directly and when such excess cost is due to increased size or depth of such sewer or to other costs which are necessary or incidental in order that such sewer or the sewer system of which it is a part may be suitable for extension in the future to serve one 1 or more other areas which could naturally drain into such sewer or sewer system the authority may elect to pay for such excess cost from the revolving sewer fund
