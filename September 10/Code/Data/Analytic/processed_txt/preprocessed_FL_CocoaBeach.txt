scope since it is typically impossible to find flexibility in traditional preexisting zoning district regulations the sdod is a means of applying flexible land use controls and land regulations which promotes a more efficient development of a parcel or parcels of land without disturbing the underlying land uses and zoning classifications in a specific zoning district or area to permit more flexible land use regulations and facilitate the most advantageous methods of land development it is often necessary to establish conditional or alternate uses and development requirements that apply to different zoning districts through the creation of an sdod these uses are encouraged as alternatives to traditional land uses typically permitted within each zoning district and the following regulations shall apply to the zoning of all sdods b purpose and intent the sdod requires a development agreement be created between the applicant and the city before an sdod can become effective the

guidelines intent the city of cocoa beach is seeking to create use of a formbased code in the redevelopment subdistricts architectural forms that add texture and composition to the streets and to these subdistricts architecture derives much of its aesthetics from its structural system which guides the placement of door and window openings and other design elements buildings must be sized appropriately for their context and should help to form wellproportioned public spaces a building footprint and proportion both new developments and redevelopment must consider the building footprint and proportions of adjacent structures and neighborhood context 1 the arrangement of openings on building facades must be organized in a rational manner typically aligned both vertically and horizontally 2 frequent building entries must be provided these entries would ideally be functional but may be faux if circumstances of structure and function preclude an operable entry long building facades or storefronts must have multiple openings to preserve the small scale and character of cocoa beach 3 when new development or redevelopment is adjacent to existing single family residences the setback requirements provided within the rs1 zoning district shall apply b varying height and volume nothing in this code section is intended to change the building height or density restrictions contained in the city of cocoa beach charter 1 mixeduse developments and larger singleuse buildings shall avoid creation of a large dominant building mass by varying height and volumes in multistory buildings 2 varying roof heights and faade treatments and color can create a better scale of the buildings to the street or other public realm c building articulation architectural and faade treatment

communitys cultural and ecological heritage but it is rarely visible from the street it is mostly viewed from the beach itself and the beachside of oceanfront buildings 1 eastwest street ends provide the primary access points to the beach and ocean these street ends consist mostly of a small parking area and a nondescript dune crossover structure as redevelopment of adjacent property occurs or as public funds become available the ends of these streets must be redesigned to enhance views to the water and each street end should be distinctively designed 2 on new construction and redevelopment allow more views to the water from the sidewalk street and other publicsemipublic areas by creating building separation and by creating view corridors building from the street 3 buildings at street ends must be set back from the sidewalk to create a transition zone of semipublic space which can highlight views and beach access points with additional landscaping gathering spaces or sidewalks 4 for corner buildings with frontage on eastwest streets lobbies and commercial spaces must have a second entrance on the eastwest street to encourage more people to walk to the end of the street and the beach c semipublic spaces the placement of buildings on their lot and the spaces between the building and public spaces such as streets can be considered semipublic space semipublic spaces are

examples of semipublic spaces designed to attract stationary activity such as sitting standing and socializing using a combination of elements such as fountains sculptures seating lighting shade structures and exhibits these elements are encouraged in central locations and should be visible from the sidewalk 2 plazas courtyards and forecourts must be designed to maximize pedestrian movement between adjacent buildings and uses exh a 452018 streets in each subdistrict there are future public streets to be constructed by the landowner during the redevelopment process these streets will

stores educational and cultural facilities and residential uses ii buildings on the redevelopment portion of sr a1a must have doors windows and signs designed for those approaching by vehicle foot or bicycle b sr 520 is an arterial that is designed as a boulevard that features higher speed central lanes for slower moving side access lanes for local traffic the central and side access lanes are separated from each other by medians planted with regularlyspaced trees i the slow moving side access lanes accommodate bicycles and onstreet parking this onstreet parking is key to achieving streetoriented buildings built close to the sidewalk ii sidewalks on a boulevard must be a minimum of ten 10 feet wide to accommodate easy strolling for pedestrians and outdoor dining pedestrians on the sidewalk must be sheltered from the sun and elements with regularly planted shade trees and awnings iii signage along a boulevard must be designed for visibility both to passing vehicles as well

front yards must be used to form a zone of semipublic space and to reduce the negative visual impact of parked cars facing the sidewalk 3 primary pedestrian streets primary pedestrian streets are the streets most attractive to pedestrians even though they also accommodate slowermoving cars primary pedestrian streets can occur on some sections or all parts of certain local or arterial streets these streets include shopping dining and entertainment venues that are the hub of pedestrian activity and social interactions in the redevelopment districts businesses along these corridors are expected to

special commercial districts which allows onstreet and public parking to be counted towards the total parking of commercial businesses in these districts to protect the nature and character of these historic areas encourage a sense of community pride and protect the health safety and welfare of the residents the following findings of fact are made 1 these special commercial districts should be protected and promoted  and 2 pedestrian traffic should be encouraged in these special commercial district areas  and 3 insufficient land area exists in these special commercial districts to allow for the construction of sufficient offstreet parking to support new and existing businesses in these areas  and 4 requiring owners seeking new construction and redevelopment permits to construct the coderequired offstreet parking could require the razing of an inordinate percentage of certain historic structures and damage the unique character of these areas  and 5 owners and tenants who seek to redevelop existing commercial lots should be encouraged to preserve the unique character of these special commercial districts  and 6 allowing owners and tenants to utilize a certain amount of existing onstreet and public parking towards the redevelopment of their own properties may stimulate creative design solutions and promote a sense of relatedness among properties in these special commercial districts c purposes intent and objective it is the intent of this section to relax the normal required parking standards in these special commercial districts where the business owner may count a certain percentage of onstreet and public parking towards the required parking for their place of business with the objective to help stimulate the revitalization of these original commercial

transportation facilities between the public and private sectors this section known as the proportionate fairshare program is required by fs  16 b findings 1 the citys proportionate fairshare program program shall a provide a method for the impacts of development on transportation facilities to be mitigated by the public and private sectors b allow applicants to proceed under certain conditions by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of a needed transportation facility c provide adequate public facilities for future growth and promote a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning while reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion d maximize the use of public funds for needed transportation facilities to serve future growth and under certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the cie e be consistent with fs  16 and support the citys comprehensive plan c applicability 1 the program must apply to all developments notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency including transportation facilities maintained by the county or state pursuant to the requirements of subsection d below 2 the program does not apply to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate fairshare under fs  12 or those developments exempted from concurrency in the citys comprehensive plan land development or fs   regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts if any d general requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development complies with the comprehensive plan and ldc regulations b the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the citys cie will satisfy the requirements of the citys transportation los requirements the provisions of subsections d2 may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the citys cie or an adopted longterm capital improvements program 2 the city may allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency by contributing to an improvement that will satisfy the requirements of the citys transportation los requirements which is not contained in the fiveyear cie or a longterm capital improvements program where the following shall apply a the city commission adopts an ordinance to commit to adding the improvement to the fiveyear cie or a long term capital improvements program no later than the next annual update to qualify for consideration the proposed improvement must be found financially feasible pursuant to fs  16b1 which means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably expected to fully mitigate impacts on these facilities in ten 10 years or less b if the funds allocated for the fiveyear cie are insufficient to fully fund construction of a required transportation improvement the city may still enter into an agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of proportionate development if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system 3 any project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet the design standards of the city for city streets and those of the fdot for state routes and highways e intergovernmental coordination the city must coordinate with affected jurisdictions including fdot regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the city an interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose f determining proportionate fairshare obligation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include without limitation separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 2 the city must not require an applicant to pay more than their proportionate fairshare the fair market value for the impacted facilities must not differ regardless of the method of mitigation 3 the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation must be as provided for in fs  12 as follows the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume msv of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los multiplied by the construction cost at the time of developer payment of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los please see calculation method described below proportionate fairshare   development trips  sv increase  cost where development trips   those trips from the stagephase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency sv increase   service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i per subsection d cost   adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i cost shall include all associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and anticipated construction costs in the year they will be incurred 4 for the purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city must determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the cie the mpotip or the fdot work program where such information is not available improvement cost shall be determined using one 1 of the following methods a an analysis by the city engineer of the costs involved in the project compared to cost data from recent projects in order to accommodate cost increases project costs shall be adjusted by the rate of inflation for street construction costs  or b the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs as adjusted by urban or rural crosssection from locally available data from recent projects on acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted fdot work program shall be determined by the most current method utilized by the fdot district 5 if the city has accepted rightofway row dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the row shall be valued at one hundred 100 percent of the most recent assessed market value by the citys selected property appraiser and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing legal description and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the row dedication is less than the citys estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant shall pay the difference prior to purchase acquisition or donation of any real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fairshare public or private partners should contact the fdot for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations g impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation 1 proportionate fairshare contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that any portion of the fairshare mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local governments impact fee ordinance applicable to the project any impact fee credit must be approved in accordance with the procedures for such credit as established by the brevard county board of county commissioners 2 except as may be required by subsection g1 above impact fee credits for the contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the agreement as they become due per any applicable transportation impact fee ordinance if the applicants proportionate obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount pursuant to the requirements of the impact fee ordinance 3 major projects not included within the citys impact fee ordinance or created under subsections d2a and b which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the citys discretion for impact fee credits 4 the proportionate obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location as a result any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the local impact fee ordinance h proportionate fairshare

nonrefundable i appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate revenues must be placed in the project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the citys cie or as otherwise established in the terms of the agreement at the discretion of the city revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the project from which the revenues were derived proportionate revenues may also be used as the required local match for funding under the fdot transportation regional incentive program trip 2 should scheduled facility improvement be removed from the cie then revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridorsector to mitigate the impacts of development in accordance with subsection d2b 3 where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in fs   then the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions to apply proportionate fairshare and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the fdot trip such
