creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  six hundred 600 in 198 two thousand two hundred 2200 in 198 four thousand six hundred 4600 in 198 eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive 8555 in 1985 and two hundred fiftythree thousand four hundred fortyeight 253448  8 as of november of 200 there have been twentysix thousand one hundred twentyseven 26127 reported cases of aids in the state of illinois 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test 10 the number of cases of early less than one 1 year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with thirtythree thousand six hundred thirteen 33613 cases reported in 1982 and fortyfive thousand two hundred 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million 500000 cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this article o06  2 12213 definitions the following

inspection which becomes more and more difficult as the number of places and persons to be watched increase o28  2 31406 designation of residential collection contractor the village board of trustees

restrictions for the following categories of nonconformities a nonconforming uses b nonconforming structures c nonconforming lots of record d nonconforming signs e nonconforming fences the degree of

hardship exists while the regulations of this related to nonconformities allow such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time the regulations restrict further investments that

useful in protecting the character of substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriately rigid regulations upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas that lend themselves to an individual planned approach through the flexibility of the planned development technique the village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives a the creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible application of other village land use regulations  b the efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets while lowering development and housing costs  c the promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in better design and development including aesthetic amenities  d the combination and coordination of architectural styles building forms and building relationships  e the preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography vegetation and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion  f the provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space  g an increase in the amount of open space over that which would result from the application of conventional subdivision and zoning regulations  and h the encouragement of land uses that promote the public health safety and general welfare article 16  zoning
