land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the petersburg community further the city finds as follows a stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies thereby degrading water quality  b impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  c improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence and intensity of flooding which endangers property and human welfare  d improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff and increases erosion and sedimentation  e construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  f the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen resulting from stormwater runoff accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies and adversely affecting flora and fauna  g siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of water bodies to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  h substantial economic losses may result from adverse impacts upon the waters of the petersburg ecosystem  i the city has an existing stormwater control program it administers various stormwater management functions and maintains a system of storm and surface water management facilities including but not limited to conduits manholes channels ditches waterways drainage easements retention and detention basins infiltration facilities and other components  j the existing stormwater system in the city requires regular maintenance and improvements  k due to the age of existing infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement of some portions of the existing stormwater system and implementation of new stormwater systems are required  l all developed property in the city either uses or benefits from the citys administration of its stormwater control program  m the extent of use of the stormwater program by each property depends upon factors such as land use and the amount of impervious surface on the property which influence runoff  n the costs of administration of the citys stormwater program should be allocated to the extent practicable to all property owners based in part on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their property on the stormwater system  and o management of the citys stormwater program to protect the public health safety and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the public to finance stormwater management adequately with a reasonable and equitable user fee system so each user of the program pays to the extent to which the user contributes to the need for the stormwater program 2 purpose of article the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the immediate and longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city in order to effectuate this purpose this article has the following objectives a to develop a stormwater control program to be responsible for the construction operation and maintenance of stormwater devices  for stormwater system planning  for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management codes  b to adopt stormwater utility fees sufficient to administer the citys stormwater control program and plan construct operate and maintain stormwater management systems throughout the city  c to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and nature  d to protect restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of community waters  e to prevent individuals business organizations and governments from causing harm to the community by activities which adversely affect water resources  f to encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems  g to encourage the protection of natural systems and the use of those systems in ways not impairing their beneficial functioning  h to minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters  i to maintain or restore groundwater

intent the purpose of the water quality impact assessment is to 1 identify the impacts of proposed land disturbance development or redevelopment on water quality and lands within rpas and other environmentallysensitive lands 2 ensure that where development activities do take place within rpas and other sensitive lands it will be located on those portions of a site and in a manner that will be least disruptive to the natural functions of rpas and other sensitive lands 3 protect individuals from investing funds for improvements proposed for location on lands unsuited for such development because of high groundwater erosion or vulnerability to flood and storm damage 4 provide for administrative relief from the terms of this article when warranted and in accordance with the requirements contained in this article 5 specify mitigation which will address water quality protection b water quality impact assessment required a water quality impact assessment is required for 1 any proposed

assessment submittal the city director of public works may require review by the chesapeake bay local assistance department upon receipt of a major water quality impact assessment the city director of
