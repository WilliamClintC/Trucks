in one or two stages as follows a as a detailed hillside and foothill development plan on an application form to be provided by the planning director and including all information required by this chapter b as a conceptual master plan 1 the applicant must specify on the application form that concept approval is being requested and must be accompanied by a request for rezoning if the land is not zoned for the intended use a concept approval is a statement by the city of boise that a general development plan including the general arrangement of uses density location of major streets open spaces utilities etc is acceptable a concept review allows the applicant to obtain approval of a general development plan without incurring the expense of preparing detailed building plans until after the concept approval it provides the developer and the city with guidelines for the design of each phase of a project supporting information shall be required for concept applications as determined by the planning director 2 a concept plan which falls under the purview of this section will by its nature require more detailed engineering studies than concept plans in less sensitive areas therefore at least generalized plans for drainage grading and utility service shall be provided with the application 3 each phase of a concept approval requires detailed hillside and foothill development approval new application fee and public hearing conditions attached to applications for detailed hillside and foothill approval shall not exceed the parameters of the conditions of approval attached

said permit shall lapse d extensions 1 the pzc may upon written request by the holder grant a oneyear time extension to an unexpired conceptual or detailed hillside and foothills development permit a a maximum of three extensions may be granted to initiate the project or a phase of a project b additional conditions of approval may be required based upon the existence of legal requirements not existing at the time of the original approval 2 upon receipt of written request for extension the director shall determine if a hearing on the request is required based on the following considerations a detailed permits whether there have been significant amendments to the boise city comprehensive plan or title 11 boise city which will apply to the subject permit  if significant land use changes have occurred in the project vicinity which would adversely impact the project or be adversely impacted by the project  whether hazardous situations have developed or have been discovered in the

foothills developers must have some assurance that concept plans that have been initiated in accordance with existing ordinances and conditions of approval may be completed under the originally applied standards therefore approved conceptual master plans will not be subject to new ordinance requirements if the following findings are made the applicant has made significant on and offsite

foothills development standards modification and revocation march 2013 boise development if development of previous phases of the plan have occurred in such a manner that it is physically impossible or economically unfeasible to comply with the new ordinance standards  the applicant demonstrates that application of the new standards will make it impossible or totally unfeasible to complete the remaining phases of the concept plan  and if any of the considerations in i ii or iii above are found to exist with regard to the project for which an extension is sought a hearing shall be required 3 if a hearing is required notice shall be provided as described in of this a new application and fee must be submitted in compliance with current plans and ordinances and in accordance with the

purpose a the flood hazard areas of boise city idaho are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and government services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b flood losses are caused by natural forces and construction practices which increase flood heights and velocities and by structures which are inadequately anchored and which may damage property in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses c it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditures of public money and costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified when property is in an area of special flood hazards  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 2 methods of reducing flood losses this chapter describes guidelines and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which resulting damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  chapter 1108 flood hazard regulations  general provisions applicability march 2013 boise development c controlling the alteration of natural
