provisions  19101 short title this be known and may be cited as the susquehanna township stormwater management   19102 statement of findings the governing body of susquehanna township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of susquehanna township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  19101 foreword  19102 fwd377  19103 purpose the purpose of this to promote health safety and welfare within susquehanna township dauphin county by

stormwater management and erosion and sedimentation control  22601 statement of findings the township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain townships to implement a program of stormwater controls these townships are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the township  22601 foreword  22602 fwd541  22602 purpose the purpose of this to promote health safety and welfare within the township and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  22601 of this provisions designed to a manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems b utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as possible c encourage infiltration of stormwater where appropriate to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources d maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the township and the commonwealth e

design storms are all subject to the specified release rates 2 if the developer can show that the postdevelopment hydrograph matches the predevelopment hydrograph for peak flows and volume for all design storms then meeting the requirements of the release rates are not required 3 specific watershed requirements a paxton creek watershed specified release rate districts for all districts in this category the future runoff must be controlled to the specified release rate that is the postdevelopment runoff rate must be less than or equal to the predevelopment rate multiplied by the specified release rate for that district b paxton creek watershed provisional no detention districts these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities however the developer must prove that the local runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff  22611 foreword  22612 fwd551 from the site to the main channel have adequate capacity to safely transport unattenuated increased peak flows for a twentyfiveyear storm in accordance with  226133 if there is inadequate capacity the developer shall either use 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage facilities to convey increase peak flows consistent with  226133 when determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development will use the least restrictive runoff controls specified by this spring creek watershed specified release rate districts for all districts in this category the future runoff must be controlled to the specified release rate that is the postdevelopment runoff rate must be less than or equal to the predevelopment rate multiplied by the specified release rate for that district d areas not within the paxton creek or spring creek watershed for all areas within the township but outside the paxton

district implementation provisions i regional detention facilities will be permitted provided that adequate conveyance is available or provided from the site to the facility the acceptability and discharge characteristics of the facility will be determined on a case by case basis by the township engineer using the calibrated model developed for the paxton creek act 167 plan or spring creek act 167 plan as applicable 1 offsite areas offsite areas that drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site 2 noharm option for any proposed development site the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than existing conditions the noharm option is used when a developer can prove that the postdevelopment hydrographs can match predevelopment hydrographs or if it can be proven that the postdevelopment conditions will not cause increases in peak flows at all points downstream proof of no harm would have to be shown based upon a downstream impact evaluation which shall include a downstream hydraulic capacity analysis consistent with  226133 to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists the developer shall submit this evaluation of the impacts due to increased downstream stormwater flows in the watershed to the township a the downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development upon a dam highway structure natural point of restricted

would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas e a financial distress shall not constitute grounds for granting a noharm exemption f capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to implement the noharm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to demonstrate that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream g any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity h any municipality approving a noharm option shall notify all downstream municipalities of such approval the approving municipality shall make all relevant information used to prove a noharm option available upon request to any municipality with the paxton creek watershed and the spring creek watershed i any noharm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission the burden of proof shall rest on the developer 3 downstream hydraulic capacity analysis any downstream capacity hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a

the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at a minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff except for facilities located

detention alternatives for certain areas within the watershed it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives is the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated model as developed for the paxton creek stormwater management plan 5 capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to permit direct discharge in a provisional no detention district to implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to implement a noharm option which proposes
