numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of

determination of the village board as described in this a 5172010   general purpose the expected delay in reassessing the property taxes to correspond with the development that occurs on a given property is one year therefore the intent of the fees described in this chapter is to provide funding to each entity to offset the cost of providing services to the residents in the development for one year the fees for each entity are therefore directly related to the projected population of the development based on the number size and type of the housing units to be constructed a 5172010

to preserve the unique assets that the airport offers to the village and to promote a more comprehensive and consistent land use pattern in the areas adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport with the rpz and transition area certain requirements are established which apply over and above those set forth under the established zoning district for any affected building structure or use these requirements are intended to regulate the development growth or construction of objects that may become hazards to air traffic utilizing the chicago executive airport and that could endanger the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity by enacting zoning standards safety and airport externalities can be monitored and controlled b runway protection zone and transition area defined the following areas or so much thereof as are within the corporate boundaries of the village hereby described with reference to the runways at the chicago executive airport are designated as the rpz and transition area 1 runway protection zone the dimensions of the rpz depend on the type of runway the following rpz areas are depicted on the zoning map a rpz for a precision instrument runway with respect to runways designated as precision instrument runways the area five hundred feet on either side of the centerline of the runway in width and extending two hundred feet from the end of the runway in both directions in length  plus that area lying directly under the approach surface as defined and established in of title 19a of the wheeling municipal from two hundred feet from the end of the runway to one thousand seven hundred feet out from the end of the runway  and b rpz for a visual runway operational with respect to runways designated as visual runways the area two hundred fifty feet on either side of the centerline of the runway in width and extending two hundred feet from the end of the runway in length  plus that area lying directly under the approach surface as defined and established in of title 19a of the wheeling municipal from two hundred feet outward from the end of the runway to one thousand two hundred twenty feet from the end of the runway 2 transition area the transitional surface as defined in of title 19a of the wheeling municipal is a surface extending outward and upward at right or ninetydegree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation of the primary surface and the approach surfaces extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface
