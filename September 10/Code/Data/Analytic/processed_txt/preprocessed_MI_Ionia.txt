accomplish among others the following objectives ato reduce artificially induced flood damage  bto minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development  cto minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses culverts and bridges and other structures  dto encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist  eto prevent an increase in nonpoint source pollution  fto maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes  gto minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed stability  hto reduce erosion from development or construction projects  ito preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution  jto reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and onpoint source pollution wherever practicable from lands that were developed without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this chapter  kto reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and to that end this

and purposes of this chapter the following three storm water management zones zones a b and c are hereby established the zones are shown on the map attached as appendix a of original incorporated herein by reference azone a zone a represents areas which require the most protective storm water management regulations the goal of this zone is to preserve the natural condition of water bodies included in it in whole or in part zone a has in general little impervious surface area and few storm water facilities in this zone when site conditions permit infiltration of storm water runoff shall be required rather than the directed flow of storm water runoff into water bodies this storm water management practice provides greater protection for surface water quality and also assists in augmenting stream base flow reduction of flash storm flows and prevention of stream bank erosion of this chapter specifies design criteria for zone a in order that the volume and rate of storm water runoff are controlled at predevelopment levels bzone b zone b represents developed areas that have significant impervious surfaces and storm water runoff facilities in place the goal of zone b is the control of storm water runoff in order to prevent further destabilizing of streams and other water bodies in this zone the use of detention ponds the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips and other measures to reduce directly connected impervious areas are specified in of this chapter for the achieving of the storm water management standards applicable to zone b the management practices for this zone are intended to maintain existing water quality and to alleviate adverse downstream impact on water bodies czone c zone c consists of highly urbanized areas or areas where there has been significant modification of drainageways the amount of impervious surface area in zone c is generally greater than 25 percent among the measures required in zone c as stated in of this chapter are the use of sediment basins the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips along water bodies and the reduction of impervious surface areas that are directly connected to water bodies an important element of storm water management practice in zone c is the control and prevention of sedimentation in order to reduce pollution of water bodies passed 7202 dstorm water management zones 1in any
