interest during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of matthew bender & company inc the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus section  is section 040 located in chapter 212 of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 5 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to date passed  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 5 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent

periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages d statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirement e objectives 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the

district d background the downtown core of franklin is characterized by historic structures that are predominately late victorian italianate and beaux arts style of the late 19th and 20th centuries circa 1880 to 1930 this is exemplified by the structures along jefferson street running from walnut east to home street on the north side of the street these structures are typically two to three stories in height and consist of a lower storefront predominately of clear glass and columns or large windows an upper floor with punched masonry windows and an ornamental cornice at the top of the building the proportions of the faades are based largely on an eighteen to twentyfootwide storefront bay repeated multiple times where the buildings are larger and repeated only once where they are of a single bay width the faades are primarily constructed of glass cast iron brick masonry brick and stone masonry ornamental metal and in some cases wood trim the historic windows in the upper faades are largely double hung windows with either one over one or two over two panes an eighteen to twentyfoot width is established on the faades that run vertically building the buildings are organized by six to eight foot bay lines running vertically building consisting of columns windows and pilaster elements creating the vertical width and ordering of the faade general requirements 1 faade retention and restoration the building faades on a street provide the visual image of the downtown because they are composed of similar parts their appearance should be organized and coordinated over the years however maintaining this appearance has been a challenge due to technological developments changing tenants and different merchandising trends a storefront will go design changes over time the upper faade often viewed as less important tends to have been ignored or even covered over because building appearance is an essential ingredient of a successful downtown owners are encouraged to restore and maintain their building facades in the original intended manner the primary faades of all historic structures outstanding notable or contributing by the johnson county interim inventory report published by historic landmarks foundation of indiana 1985 should have all defining features of the overall historical character retained in the case where these defining features no longer exist have been torn down or covered up these features should be restored if and when restoration or remodeling takes place in the particular area of the feature where documentation of the original is not accessible all work on a faade should comply with the standards for new development in subsection 12 changes that have no historical basis or seek to create an earlier appearance should be avoided the faade of the typical downtown building is made up of three parts the storefront with entrance and display windows the upper faade and the cornice that caps the building within these three parts are the details that give a faade its character including the bulkheads transom storefront cornice windows and window hoods see figure 2 when planning a faade renovation consult the following standards as well as the standards relating to specific elements found later in these standards a faade retention all historic buildings should be preserved in the case of commercial buildings where the area of the building behind the faade is in severely deteriorated condition all primary faades should be retained and new construction may be infilled behind the faade a original features historic elements and examples of craftsmanship should be retained wherever possible the removal of distinguishing features or significant architectural details should be avoided previously made changes that have achieved architectural or design significance should be retained b exception in the case where an accessory structure is so severely deteriorated that it is an unsafe structure the accessory structure may be razed this exception should not be construed as permitting the demolition of an accessory structure by means of purposely causing or allowing it to fall into disrepair b faade restoration the following standards apply to the repair or restoration of any faade or faade feature a historic buildings should retain all architectural elements such as windows cornices porches roof lines eaves entry ways and faade materials deteriorated architectural elements on any historic building should be repaired or replaced where an architectural element has been previously removed or the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a feature the new feature should match the original in size scale and architectural style and where possible materials synthetic materials may be used in the case where original materials are not available b nonhistoric buildings which contain architectural elements similar to those on surrounding historic buildings should retain those elements by repairing or replacing those elements it is recommended that those elements be repaired rather than replaced if those elements are being replaced they should match the original in size scale and architectural style those elements should not be removed without being replaced c where any architectural element on a primary faade or other highly visible location is being replaced the replacement feature should match identically any parts portions or pieces of remaining similar architectural elements in size scale style design color and where possible materials d where the replacement of an architectural element is limited to the secondary faade and is not highly visible the replacement feature shall be consistent with architectural style of the building and should not clash with the overall architecture of the building or any individual architectural details e chemical or physical treatments that cause damage to historic building materials should not be used the surface cleaning of structures should be undertaken using the gentlest means possible in order to preserve the building materials f infilling enclosing covering or removing of any original windows doors storefronts porches display windows or other architectural details is prohibited g shutters if utilized should be sized to appear as though they could work however shutters were seldom used on 19th and 20th century buildings h awnings should be of a proportion and color to complement the existing colors of the building i accessibility modifications should be made at side or rear entrances to maintain faade integrity the following are the defining primary faade features which should be retained or restored this should not be construed as preventing the ordinary maintenance and repair of a faade a kick plates at the base of storefront display windows  b clear glass which does not produce excess amounts of glare for all first story windows and glazing  c original recessed entrance areas angled vestibules spaces or corners  d transoms above doors and windows  e clearstory portions of the faade  f signage bands including relevant ornamentation  g original window styles including opening size and location sashes mullions muntins sills and heads  h decorative columns pilasters of cast iron brick or stone  i cornices  j parapet walls the following additional requirements also apply to all facades a in the case where a building was originally built in such a way that it would not meet the standards of this chapter and the faade does not contribute to the overall character of the downtown overlay district any remodeling of such buildings facades should follow the standards for new development this should not be interpreted as being required during ordinary maintenance and repair b no hvac mechanical or other equipment should be placed on or attached to the primary faade additionally equipment should be concealed from view from any public street c first floor display windows should allow visibility from any pedestrian walkway into the business or contain a display of products art or other creative display which is oriented towards and facing the sidewalk and is a minimum of eighteen 18 inches deep no obstruction of view such as paper or plywood coverings or interior facing display case is permitted within eighteen 18 inches of the interior of the glazing except during active construction for which all required certificates permits and approvals have been obtained d windows on secondary faade or upper stories should not be covered from the inside with coverings such as paper or plywood if the space behind the window is vacant it is recommended that the window contain blinds or curtains if blocking of the window is so desired e the use of the following inappropriate materials should not be used i coarsely finished rustic material such as wood shake shingles barn boards plywood and wood siding ii carpeting iii expanded or perforated metals industrial metal siding wire mesh or corrugated metal or fiberglass iv inappropriate ornate ironwork such as new orleans style grills and rail work v stucco surfaces with rustic or highly textured surfaces characteristic of mediterranean or southwestern styles vi antique appearing synthetic oversized or variegated brick vii silver gold or clear anodized bright metal including aluminum or stainless steel trim for windows and doors viii residential type materials such as embossed entry doors sliding patio doors and residential beveled and leaded stained glass doors ix flat or molded plastic sheeting used to simulate historic materials stone or masonry veneers x rustic field stone or rustic rock masonry work xi flush glazing treatments glass block windows or mirrored highly tinted colored metalized or reflective glass 2 window restoration and replacement windows play an important visual role in the downtown display windows provide merchants with an area to display their wares the upper story windows establish the pattern that helps tie together the faades of a block transom windows provide light and ventilation to the inside of the building window style and decoration has changed years see figure 3 however proper care and maintenance of all storefront windows remain key to an attractive building display windows the display window is a crucial element in the success of a downtown business an attractive wellplanned display can be the difference between someone merely walking by or actually coming in to shop after setting up your window display be sure to view the display from outside to gain the same perspective as customers and passersby also be careful with all window signage while a display window can provide space for an attractive painted sign you should not cover excessive amounts of any window with signage upper story windows upper story windows are often neglected inappropriately replaced or even boarded up not only does this impact the appearance of the building it can change the character of a block if your building has upper story windows be sure to set up a regular maintenance schedule this will help prevent further deterioration transom windows transom windows located at the top of the storefront opening are a source of natural light and ventilation for energy conservation these windows were often covered or removed covering or painting over transom windows upsets the design relationship of the faade and destroys the rhythm of repeating patterns on the street uncovering and restoring transom windows is encouraged windows on historic buildings are the most important elements in defining its architectural character and significance their original materials and features should be respected and retained repairing historic windows has become easier with the introduction of new materials and techniques the following standards apply to the restoration or replacement of windows a window repair the most common window problems involve damaged or deteriorated wood faulty window operation and broken glass panes many problems can be easily repaired at a minimum cost a deteriorated wood is often found on the sill or bottom of the sash these parts can be replaced without replacing the whole window local building supply stores may have pieces that match the original window minor repairs can be made by scraping off old paint filling in cracks with putty or caulk sanding priming and applying a fresh coat of paint b a window that isnt operating like it used to should be addressed it could be that the window is painted shut this can be corrected by tapping the sash with a hammer wrapped in cloth another problem could be with the window mechanism sash locks cords and weights if this is the case contact a window dealer who can offer assistance without changing the window franklin heritage can recommend contractors who have experience with this type of work c broken glass panes can be easily fixed by removing all old glass and glazing putty and installing a new pane using the appropriate glaziers points and putty d be sure to check all joints between a window and its masonry opening if loose or open joints exist caulk to prevent air and water filtration e window trim cornices sills and decorative window caps or other details should be replaced and installed on historic buildings only if they originally existed in the case of nonhistoric buildings these window elements may be added only where they fit the architectural style of the building enhancing windows with superfluous nonhistoric or architecturally inaccurate details is not permitted f creating new window openings or eliminating original window openings that significantly alter the character of the elevations is prohibited g reestablishing original window openings that have been reduced or completely closed is encouraged new windows used to reestablish the original openings need to follow the standards for window replacement b window replacement sometimes repairs may be impractical and the only option available is replacement if youre replacing only one window find a replacement that matches the existing units if you cannot find a suitable replacement consider having one custom made wood is the preferred choice however if you must use aluminum or vinyl a darker color is preferred do not alter the existing window opening to fit new windows and do not install windows that are not in keeping with the style of your building see figure 4 c storm windows installing storm windows is a great way to cut down on your energy costs the downside is that they often look inappropriate on an older building faade if possible consider installing storm windows on the inside so they will not be seen if they must be installed on the outside make sure they are the same shape and have the same overall design features as other outside windows an anodized or bakedon finish is more desirable than plain aluminum 3 masonry repair and restoration regular maintenance is the most efficient and economical way to keep your building looking its best as a general rule you should treat any historic detail with care first and foremost maintain what you have if necessary repair or replace the detail duplicating or complimenting the original the following tips will assist you in identifying and addressing potential problems every effort should be made to retain the historic masonry faades in their original design shape and architectural appearance including all relevant detailing and ornamentation for the purposes of this section masonry includes stone brick architectural terra cotta cast stone concrete and concrete block typically masonry deterioration and damage has been caused by neglect or deferred maintenance due to water infiltration horizontal and vertical movement of the masonry due to disengagement from the structural frame vertical settlement or horizontal movement due to expansion and contraction extreme care is required for any masonry repair to prevent an obvious unsightly patch moisture brick and stone are durable but they can deteriorate over time most often water infiltration is responsible moisture can enter top of a wall or where the wall meets the roof check your roof flashing and wall copings periodically for soundness gutters and downspouts should also be inspected periodically for leakage a tuckpointing the mortar used in older masonry buildings gradually erodes as water runs over the wall surface and with freezethaw cycles joints should be inspected periodically for crumbling or missing mortar if mortar joints have recessed more than two inches they should be repointed with new mortar to prevent water infiltration and ensure the integrity of the wall new mortar joints should match the original in style size composition and color it is especially important to repoint with mortar of the same hardness as the original the softer historic mortar compresses as the bricks expand in warm weather and flexes as they contract in cold weather it is by design the sacrificial element of the wall and gradual erosion is to be expected harder modern mortars with a high content of portland cement will resist the warm weather expansion of the brick which can cause cracks in the brick surface in the cold weather this same inflexibility may cause cracks to open up as the historic bricks contract b cleaning masonry cleaning can have a huge impact on the appearance of a building most historic masonry buildings have never been cleaned and accumulated dirt can obscure the original masonry color masonry should always be cleaned by the gentlest method possible in many cases low pressure water washing no more than two hundred fifty 250 psi together with scrubbing with a natural bristle brush may be sufficient if paint or heavy grime must be removed a chemical cleaner may be required there are a variety of chemical cleaners available and a qualified cleaning contractor should be consulted to evaluate your building and recommend a treatment whatever treatment is selected a test patch should first be tried in an inconspicuous area and allowed to weather for a few weeks or months if the results of the test are satisfactory and no damage is observed it should be safe to proceed remember to protect nearby trees shrubs and groundcover when cleaning your building chemical cleaners may be hazardous to vegetation the following treatments are appropriate and should be used during all cleaning repairing and restoring of masonry a cleaning masonry with the least abrasive method possible b using test patches in inconspicuous areas on secondary elevations to determine the appropriate means of cleaning c addressing and correcting the underlying cause of damage to masonry before any repair or repointing is undertaken d mortar joints should be cleaned out and loose mortar removed to appropriate depth usually one to one replacing typically all mortar on historic buildings with a high lime content e all mortar should be carefully removed so as to not damage any of the edges of masonry surfaces f all replacement masonry should match the existing whether it is salvaged or new material and reused material should be closely matched in terms of size color and texture g painted masonry structures should be permitted to retain painted surfaces after appropriate cleaning and removing of loose paint and debris c inappropriate masonry treatments the following treatments are discouraged for all cleaning repairing and restoring of masonry a you should not use abrasive treatments sand blasting or high pressure washing to clean masonry surfaces b replacing bricks and brick masonry unless it is excessively spalled or cracked instead the same bricks should be reused if possible by cleaning and reversing their faces use of contemporary new brick that is antique in appearance with a wide range of color is discouraged brickwork particularly on historic buildings is usually uniform in character c covering of historic masonry surfaces with any type of siding metal or synthetic sidings stucco exterior insulation finishing systems eifs or ceramic or fiberglass veneers d using any kind of power grinding to remove masonry or to remove mortar or to alter masonry e sandblasting should not be done on historic structures unless where otherwise specifically allowed sandblasting is especially harmful to brick surfaces eroding the hard outer layer to expose a softer more porous surface that will weather rapidly you should be aware that sandblasting will disqualify a project from consideration when applying for state and federal tax credits f exposed masonry should never be painted a previously painted surface can be restored by a chemical paint remover previously painted structures should in all probability be retained as such because removing paint can result in detrimental effects to the underlying masonry surfaces g waterproofing repellants or sealers used on any masonry surface these materials can potentially cause serious damage by trapping moisture in masonry which would cause deterioration in the future if used it is essential to allow breathing of the surfaces on which they are applied h abrasive methods for paint removal to expose original brick 4 wood maintenance storefronts cornice brackets and other decorative faade elements were often made of wood these original exterior woodwork elements should be retained wherever possible regular maintenance will prevent deterioration check periodically for soft rotted areas splits and dampness damage or decayed sections can usually be repaired by renailing caulking and filling epoxy pastes and epoxy consolidants can also be very effective in repairing even seriously rotted wood when painting use an oilbased primer followed by two coats of oilbased paints severely rotted or missing pieces may be reproduced by a good carpenter or millwork shop try to match or at least complement the existing details when replacing woodwork 5 metal maintenance many of the buildings in the historic core of franklin are defined by the cast iron and ornamental metal elements that form the storefronts at the pedestrian level these elements are principal defining features of the faades and should be retained and restored possible effort the lower display window kick fronts support columns window mullions and decorative elements of the transom and sign bands are typically made of these materials stamped or pressed metal was most often used to create decorative metal cornices this kind of architectural ornamentation became quite popular because intricate detail could be reproduced at a reasonable cost the signs of metal deterioration are obvious corrosion tears holes and missing pieces pressed or stamped metal may be of copper which requires no surface protection or of sheet iron usually coated with zinc or lead to retard rusting a proper coat of paint is essential to prevent rust and corrosion on such metals missing parts can be reproduced in fiberglass or aluminum using existing pieces to make a mold be sure to communicate to the person fabricating the replacement part the importance of maintaining the intricate decoration of such pieces appropriate cleaning and repair strip and clean off old paint and rust using appropriate chemical strippers and nonabrasive power washing and light sandblasting extreme caution should be taken with rolled sheet metal surfaces so as to not damage them if any of the power washing or light nonabrasive power blasting methods are used 6 decorative glass maintenance beveled stained leaded and etched glass are all forms of decorative glass glass decoration is often covered up look for it in transoms or behind plywood window covers sagging means that the glass and frame will need to be reinforced with a brace leaded or stained glass can have problems the metal between the glass pieces called the came could either be zinc or lead you should always use the same metal when making repairs 7 color guidelines and recommendations choosing the right color combination for a building can unify the elements of the faade and relate the building to others on the block again step outside and look at your building as it relates to others make sure the colors you use are in character with the rest of the buildings on the block generally no more than three colors are sufficient for a building faade paint manufacturers have a large selection of historic colors available and can assist with an appropriate color scheme stay away from bold colors that attract undo attention to the property the use of fluorescent metallic reflective or glittery colors for exterior walls trim or other architectural features is prohibited background muted or natural tones are appropriate for the background of the building the background consists of the upper wall and the piers on either side of the storefront this color is often natural brick and requires no painting in fact painting of brick surfaces is strongly discouraged and discussed in subsection 3 masonry repair and restoration major trim the color of major trim elements such as cornices window frames sills and hoods and the storefront frame bulkhead and columns should complement the background color secondary trim secondary trim such as the window sashes doors and certain cornice and bulkhead details should enhance the color scheme established by the background and major trim a darker shade of the major trim is often used to highlight these features caution should be exercised to ensure that the faade is not overdecorated in general color schemes should be selected that are appropriate to the buildings style and period using a 1950s color scheme on a victorian building is inappropriate the color schemes should be developed to enhance the characterdefining elements of the architecture and to complement and relate to its neighbors in the downtown core different color schemes were popular at various times in the mid 1800s soft neutral tints were common toward the end of the 19th century darker richer shades were used tastes changed again at the beginning of the 1900s to lighter calmer colors if you are thinking about returning your building to its original colors carefully scrape the paint from a small area there may be several layers of paint over the original color its possible that the original color may have changed over time for a better idea of the true color wet the original surface the base color will appear more accurately when wet it is not necessary that colors be researched and analyzed to document original authenticity as noted in the masonry repair section previously painted structures should in all probability be retained as such because removing paint can result in detrimental effects to the underlying masonry surfaces the sun will play an important role in the colors you select before deciding on a color take a paint chip outside to see how it looks do this at various times throughout the day and also on both sunny and cloudy days sometimes a small paint chip is not enough to get a good idea of how a color will look in that case invest in a quart of the color you choose and apply it to a small area on your building the effect may be surprising next steps painting your building can provide a dramatic improvement in your buildings appearance for a relatively low cost after deciding on the appropriate colors however your work has just begun there are several steps you should follow to ensure your new paint job will be long lasting and successful 1 type of paint should you use oilbased or latex paint both have their advantages and disadvantages oilbased paints are generally more durable and may provide better adherence cleanup is more difficult latex paints are easier to apply and cleanup is simple however latex paint can be less durable than oilbased whichever you choose select a quality paint although youll pay more a quality paint will last longer than a cheaper paint will not fade or peel as quickly and gives better coverage it is important to note that once you use a certain type of paint for your building you should continue to use the same type of paint switching back and forth between oil and latex is difficult 2 general preparation there are many things you can do to prep your building for painting check the condition of any wood and replace any boards that are rotted if you are painting a masonry building check the condition of the mortar and tuckpoint where necessary review the condition of your windows install new glass in all broken windows replace damaged putty with a glazing compound and make sure it goes all around the windows youll need to wait two to three days for the compound to dry before you can paint 3 surface preparation prior to painting all surfaces should be adequately prepared all loose or peeling paint must be removed wire brushes and scrapers are the best tools to use if these do not work consider a blow torch or electric heat gun use caution with these last two devices with only enough heat to soften the paint so it can be easily pushed away consider using a primer for the first coat especially on older buildings it will help the final coat adhere better other considerations 1 colored mortars should not be employed to alter the coloration of historic structures 2 natural colors of brick terra cotta fired clay stones masonry limestone granite sandstone or other natural materials should be retained and should not be painted over unless it is consistent with the historic precedent 3 architectural metals such as copper bronze and brass should not be painted 8 doors traditionally downtown buildings had three doors on the building front there was storefront door providing access to the business and a secondary door providing access to the upper floors see figure 5 the rear door was primarily used as a service door storefront door historically the entry to a store was more than just a door the design and appearance reflected its commercial importance the traditional storefront door was substantial built of wood with a large glass panel despite its stately proportion the door was inviting to a customer although traditional storefront doors are rarely found these days there are several things that can be done to make a front door the special inviting element it should be 1 a front door should be compatible with the rest of the storefront and make a significant statement 2 to retain a traditional appearance a wood door with a tall glass panel is most appropriate to maintain the original character try to locate a salvaged older door to repair or use a new door of similar design 3 if a traditional appearance is not desired the design choice should be based on the overall design of the storefront many different wood and metal styles are available if a glass and aluminum door is chosen consider using a dark anodized finish rather than a metallic color 4 avoid overdecorating the door the design should reinforce the character of the building and be inviting for shoppers secondary door a secondary door on the front faade provides access to the upper floors and is usually less elaborate in design when choosing a secondary door keep in mind that it should be visually understated fitting in with the overall faade but not drawing attention to itself to maintain a traditional appearance an old wood panel door is most appropriate rear door a practical style is recommended for a rear door to reflect the unadorned character of the rear faade if the back door will be used as a customer entrance consider the addition of glass to the door to make it more inviting to shoppers and passersby 9 awnings awnings can be both a decorative and functional addition to a storefront visually an awning can add character and interest to a storefront practically an awning provides a sheltered space for customers to view store window displays and can provide energy saving benefits especially when used on southern facing windows when planning an awning for your building the following should be considered design the design of an awning determines how energy efficient it will be there are two types of awnings available fixed and operable an operable awning can be opened and closed allowing sun to shine in on cold days and providing shade on warm sunny days a fixed awning is primarily decorative style awnings should be integrated into the design of the building faade with simple pitch and profile that matches the building bay structure awnings along a street should have a consistent pattern in size and shape and not conflict with others look at your neighbors buildings and visualize how adding an awning will affect the character of the streetscape see figure 6 material awnings can be constructed from several different materials including canvas vinyl and aluminum whichever material is chosen make sure it is guaranteed weatherresistant fading or bleaching from the sun is also an important consideration a canvas awnings are traditionally popular but must be weathertreated before installation canvas has a lower initial cost but may require more maintenance than plastic or aluminum b vinyl plastic has a more contemporary effect but can be attractive if done correctly vinyl is more flexible and usually requires less maintenance than fabric c aluminum is another choice but is more residential in character and not generally appropriate in the downtown area mounting awnings should be mounted so that the valence is approximately eight feet above the sidewalk a twelveinch valence flap is usually attached at the awning bar and can serve as a sign panel typically an awning will project between four and seven feet from the building an awning can be attached above the display windows and below the sign panel or cornice it can also be mounted between the transom and the display window which allows light into the store while shading the merchandise for customers an awning over upperstory windows should not cover the piers or the space between the window sills and the storefront cornice if an awning has support posts that are permanently affixed to the sidewalk approval from the board of works is required before installation contact the mayors office to make the request color look at the entire building before deciding on a color for your awning youll want a color that enhances the existing features without overwhelming them for buildings with more detail a subtle shade should be used for buildings with minimal architectural detailing a bright accent color may enhance the faade pattern is important too depending on the image you would like to project signs the valence of an awning has traditionally been used for advertising if you choose to incorporate a sign on an awning keep the message simple and for identification purposes only see figure 7 illumination internally illuminated or backlit awnings are highly discouraged and not recommended 10 signage treatments all signs must conform to article 8 chapter 1736 sign standards in addition the following standards apply to all signs in the downtown overlay zoning district signs are a vital part of any downtown they call attention to your business and help attract customers additionally signs help shape the image of downtown the following questions are provided to help you determine the right signage for your business and the downtown what is the purpose of my sign do you merely want to identify the name of your business or should you provide information on the products you sell or services you offer who are you trying to attract take some time to consider what you want your sign to do what type of message should i use can you convey your message with words or will a logo or symbol be more recognizable to potential customers possibly a combination of words and symbols is appropriate sign lettering should have a high contrast ratio in order to be clearly legible for vehicular traffic sign lettering on wall signs awning signs or projecting signs needs to be a minimum of four inches in height so as to be clearly legible for vehicular traffic what style sign should i use for most downtown businesses wall window projecting or canopy signs are the only types of signs that can be used for new development or redeveloped sites a freestanding sign is a possibility with special approval from the board of zoning appeals if you want to use a freestanding sign consider a monument style sign to maintain the pedestrian scale of the downtown taller pole signs are inappropriate and should be avoided where should i put my sign when considering sign placement you need to visualize how your sign will appear in relation to the entire faade a sign should not dominate the faade its shape and proportions should fit the building just as a door or window fits the most common location for a wall sign is just below the lower cornice this location compliments the architecture of the building and presents a strong image other common locations include on the glass display window and on the awning flap see figure 8 a good resource to consult is a picture of how your building looked in the past this may give you ideas about how signs were related to the details of your building signs should never project above the upper cornice line or be mounted on the roof of a building never cover up architectural details horizontal projecting signs have a width which is longer than the height of the sign horizontal projecting signs should project no more than four feet from the building and be no more than twelve 12 square feet in sign area in addition horizontal projecting signs should generally be located between the transom line of the first floor and the lower half of the windows of the second floor vertical projecting signs have a height which is longer than the width of the sign vertical projecting signs project no more than three feet from the building and do not exceed thirty 30 square feet in sign area in addition vertical projecting signs should be located above the first floor or sign band whichever is higher should i illuminate my sign illuminating a sign may be desirable individual backlit letters and signs illuminated by wallmounted fixtures are appropriate illuminated box signs flashing signs moving signs and electronic or fixed letter reader boards are not permitted materials appropriate sign materials include painted or carved wood galvanized sheet metal or aluminum stone materials consisting of marble slate or sandstone veneer granite or granite veneer gold leaf gilt painted accents sandblasted glass or metal stained glass clear or acrylic neon while the use of neon can create an attractive sign neon should not be used to outline or trim a building or the architectural elements 11 lighting lighting is an important element when considering visibility in the evening hours generally street lighting installed by the city will provide adequate lighting of the overall building and sidewalk however there are times when you may want to provide additional illumination to your building lighting should only be used to illuminate entries signage displays adjacent pedestrian and parking areas or to highlight significant architectural elements use fixtures with a traditional style or contemporary fixtures that are appropriately scaled building mounted fixtures should be used to illuminate entries wall mounted signs and walkways adjacent to buildings fixture color should be muted and coordinate with the overall color scheme of the building exposed or painted metal finishes are recommended to attract attention to your storefront area there are some traditional methods of lighting you can use  welllit display windows attract attention to items in your window  residual light washed the sidewalk and attracts pedestrians  light over recessed entry doors can highlight your entrance  lighted signs in the window neon is acceptable can highlight products and services 12 new development construction of new buildings on vacant lots in the downtown is encouraged the design and location of such buildings however requires special care two types of new construction are discussed infill development where new construction fills in gaps in the existing street faade and standard development where new construction is on parcels located in lesser dense areas of the downtown in order to retain the historic context and character new buildings should reflect the character of existing historic buildings by relating to the massing scale articulation and rhythm of franklins historic architecture infill development the design of new infill development especially the front faade is critical the new faade must look appropriate in relation to the surrounding buildings without replicating them when designing a new infill building particular attention should be paid to the following a building design the design of new infill buildings should be harmonious with its surroundings architectural style is not restricted however extremes of styles or attempts to recreation a style indigenous to the downtown are discouraged b building setback a new infill building should maintain the line of existing storefronts at the sidewalk edge creating gaps in the streetscape by setting the building too far back from its neighbors or by placing offstreet parking in front of a building is not permitted see figure 9 c building scaling and massing when designing a new infill building the scale height and width and mass of existing buildings along the street should be respected the average height and width of nearby buildings can be used to determine a general set of proportions for an infill structure or the bays of a larger structure the infill building should fill the entire void or if the site is large the mass of the faade can be divided into two or more smaller bays to maintain the established rhythm of the block see figure 10 primary facades should have vertical articulation a minimum of every twenty 20 feet there should be a minimum of two windows per upper story between required vertical articulations a vertical articulation may be implemented by using one or more of the following techniques a structural or expressed column a distinctive change in coloration a slightly varied faade position or distinctive change in overall style of architectural elements d buildings should meet the ground with a solid base treatment to create a visual transition from the sidewalk to the building wall glass treatments that extend to the ground are not recommended upper stories should not be set back from the first story primary faade e roof forms the type of roof used for an infill building should be similar to those found on adjacent buildings in general flat roofs are preferred over gable gambrel hop or mansard roofs a parapet should be used to conceal a flat roof and any roof protrusions other than the chimney f openings doors and windows on an infill building should be similar in size proportion and alignment based on the architectural style of the building and to those on adjacent facades the rhythm of structural mass to voids doors windows etc should relate to rhythms established on adjacent buildings see figure 11 g detailing details from adjacent buildings such as the masonry work cornice lines window shapes and bulkheads should be reflected in the architecture of infill buildings h building materials materials used in the construction of infill buildings should be similar to that used on adjacent buildings a new building should not stand out from other buildings on the block brick and wood are preferred materials
