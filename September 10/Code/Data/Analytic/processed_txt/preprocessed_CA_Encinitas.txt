flood hazard areas of the city of encinitas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  definitions

defined in of this chapter such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles building access or storage d fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings e manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited f the floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records 1 certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with   and 2 the elevation in relation to mean sea level of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor excluding pilings or columns of all new and substantially improved structures and whether such structures contain a basement variance procedure  nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of san diego recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary

utilizing nonconformitygeneral a it is unlawful for any person to enlarge extend expand or in any other manner change a nonconforming use or a structural nonconformity so as to increase its inconsistency with the zoning regulations of this chapter b a nonconforming use may be replaced with the same or a similar use so long as the subsequent use does not enlarge extend expand or in any

nonconforming has sufficient area to provide a building site has not merged and is not mergeable  termination of nonconformity general a if a nonconforming use is changed to a use that conforms to or is more consistent with the regulations of this title then any entitlement to maintain the nonconforming use is modified in that same degree b unless otherwise provided in this chapter a nonconforming use which remains inactive for 180 consecutive days shall be deemed to have ceased and shall not thereafter be renewed c if a nonconforming use or structural nonconformity is enlarged extended expanded or in any other manner changed to increase its inconsistency with the regulations of this title then in addition to any other consequences imposed by this any entitlement to thereafter

residential buildings with structuraluse nonconformity a any residential project of four or fewer dwelling units with one or more structural or use nonconformities that is damaged up to 100% by accident or voluntary of its valuation can be reconstructed with the continuation of the nonconformities provided such nonconformities are not increased in density or intensity nonconforming residential buildings of four units or less may be reconstructed added to or structurally altered so long as neither the density nor the intensity of the nonconformity is increased and the number and size of existing required parking spaces is not reduced 1 an increase to the intensity of a nonconforming structureuse would refer to a expanding the structural nonconformity eg not meeting development standards b any additions to a nonconforming use eg an existing duplex in a singlefamily zone that would expand or intensify the nonconforming use expansionsadditions to such nonconforming uses shall not be considered an intensification when the combined development of all units on the subject property does not exceed the cumulative limitations of the underlying zone where more than one dwelling unit exists on a legal lot the development allowances of the underlying zone shall be applied on a prorata basis for example if two dwelling units exist on one lot each would be allowed one half of the lot coverage andor floor area ratio applicable to the zone where all of the units on the lot are under common ownership or in the case of multiple ownership where all owners of units on the property are in agreement a different combination of percentages may be established and recorded on the subject property by covenant c an addition for the enclosing of parking shall not be considered an increase in intensity of the nonconforming use d conversion of a nonconforming detached accessory structure from a nonhabitable use type for example storage building or garage to a habitable structure type for example a portion of the primary dwelling unit or accessory unit shall be considered an intensification or creation of a nonconformity however conversion of such nonhabitable structures to accessory structures permitted under municipal w shall not be considered an intensification provided the structure is not located closer than five feet to rear and interior side lot lines and not located within front or exterior side yard setback areas pursuant to municipal e3 2 an increase to the density of a nonconforming structureuse would refer to a new construction or conversion of existing structures with the result of creating any dwelling units above the number allowed for the subject property in the applicable zone b a conforming addition to or the conversion of a portion of a legal nonconforming singlefamily residential building in order to create an accessory unit in accordance with w shall not be considered an increase in density or intensity for purposes of this section b for multifamily dwellings of five or more units the building profile may be modified if the resulting profile does not result in a structure contrary to this section and the following findings are made by the authorized agency 1 there are no additional negative impacts to the character of the neighborhood beyond the assumed negative impacts of the nonconformity  and 2 the resulting design will enhance the neighborhood and will not significantly increase the economic life of the nonconformity thereby expanding the nonconformity beyond that which would occur maintenance practices  and either a the building profile modification is necessary for protection of health and safety  or b a significant public benefit will accrue from the increase in building profile c public benefit shall include but not be limited to i additional significant public improvements will be made to the adjacent infrastructure  ii drainage in the area will be significantly enhanced as a result of the change    variances  purpose a the purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedures and standards for exercising the authority granted to the city by the state of

which the special circumstances combine with the strict application of the zoning regulations to deprive the applicant of the privilege enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification  4 the way in which the grant of the variance will bring the applicants property development into parity with other property in the vicinity and will not amount to a grant of special privilege over and above those privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under an identical zoning classification  5 the code section from which the variation is granted the degree of variation allowed and the conditions imposed on the variation b when the director has determined that all required information has been submitted in proper form and the applicant

accordance with the provisions of     resolution of determination a a final determination granting a variance shall be by notice of determination when the director is the granting authority by resolution when the planning commission is the granting authority and by resolution when the city council grants a variance on appeal b findings no granting of a variance shall be approved or conditionally approved unless the decisionmaking authority finds 1 that because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property including size shape topography location or surroundings the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification  2 that the variance shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located and is subject to any conditions necessary to assure compliance with this finding  3 that the variance does not authorize use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning regulation governing the subject property  4 that the inability to enjoy privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification a could not be avoided by an alternate development plan that would be of less significant impact to the site and adjacent properties than the project requiring the variance  b is not selfinduced as a result of action taken by the property owner or the property owners predecessors  c would not allow such a degree of variation as to constitute a rezoning or other amendment to the zoning code  and d would not authorize or legalize the maintenance of a public nuisance 5 in addition to the required findings the final determination shall set forth a the privilege lawfully enjoyed by a substantial number of other property owners in the vicinity and under an identical zoning classification  b the factors which make the subject property special when compared to other property in the area  c the way in which the special circumstances combine with the strict application of the zoning regulations to deprive the applicant of the privilege enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification  d the way in which the grant of the variance will bring the applicants property development into parity with other property in the vicinity and will not amount to a grant of special privilege over and above those privileges enjoyed

legally described as required by subsection h of this section g protection of historic public use 1 siting and design requirements development shall be sited and designed in a manner which does not interfere with or diminish any public right of access which may have been established based on historic public use only when site constraints are so severe that siting of the accessway or recreational use area in its historic location would significantly impair the proposed development and alternative development siting is not feasible development may be sited in the area of public right of access based on historic use provided that the applicant provides an equivalent area of public access or recreation to and along the same destination and including the same type intensity of public use as previously existed on the site mechanisms for guaranteeing the continued public use of the area or equivalent area shall be required in accordance with subsections c of this section 2 minimum requirements an access condition shall not serve to extinguish or waive public prescriptive rights in permits where evidence shows the possibility of such prescriptive rights the following language

immediate public access is implemented deed restriction as may be required by subsection k of this section 2 in any case where the size and character of a development would impose very substantial burdens on public access such as a large resort development on the shoreline and where the applicant has the capacity to operate and maintain the accessway or recreation area a deed restriction may be required instead of an offer to dedicate in order to assure immediate public use of the area and maintenance of the area by the applicant and successors in interest in any such case all other applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply 3 assess facilities constructed on access easements eg walkways paved paths boardwalks etc should be no wider than necessary to accommodate the
