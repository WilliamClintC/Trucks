16011618 as amended delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council ordains the following b findings of fact the following findings of fact establish the need for flood hazard regulations in the city 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which may adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes these regulations use the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses are protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  6 maintain channels and vegetation in floodprone areas so as to not increase flood hazards  332008 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly

oil and gas drilling and production is an important component of the stillwater area economy 2 oil and gas well drilling and production activities create conditions that potentially threaten the health safety and general welfare of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations 3 oil and gas well drilling and production activities in the absence of local regulatory controls may generate noxious aerial emissions introduce contaminants into groundwater emit high noise or light levels produce large volumes of dust congest local streets present fire or chemical spill hazards and produce other deleterious effects all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons or damage to property and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of the surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations 4 the proliferation of oil and gas well pad sites within the city creates conflicts between such development and other existing and future surface uses of real property within the city to assure the compatibility of residential commercial industrial and agricultural uses

tintersection the driveway shall align with the intersecting street or be offset as provided in table 1 and illustrated in figure b when the driveway is to be offset the measurement for location of the driveway will be from an extension of the property line adjacent to the intersecting street which is closest to the proposed driveway for lots with frontage too narrow to meet the separation requirements of table 1 or placement to meet this requirement would result in a hazardous situation the following criteria will be used to provide access to the lot a the applicant shall secure joint access with abutting property to provide the required separation b where it is not possible to utilize joint access a driveway may be allowed by the city engineer the city engineer shall establish the location of the driveway for each site based on 1 onsite circulation needs building setback requirements and other site constraints  2 the desire to place the driveway as far from the intersection as possible  and 3 other factors relevant to the specific development c driveways onto arterial streets with a separation of less than 150 feet shall be for right turn in and right turn out only table 1

meet the spacing requirements of table 2 in this subsection 3 where lot frontages are so narrow that meeting this standard would prevent access to individual properties or placement to meet this requirement would result in a hazardous situation the following procedures will be followed a when one or more driveways meeting the requirements of this section can serve the lot the additional driveway which cannot meet these requirements will not be allowed b where meeting this requirement would mean no access would be allowed to the lot the following procedures will be used to provide access 1 the applicant shall secure joint access with abutting property 2 where joint access driveways are not possible driveways not meeting these separation requirements may be approved by the city engineer in determining where the driveway will be placed the city engineer will identify those places on the lot where a driveway will have sight distance meeting aashto standards and otherwise not be hindered by obstructions and then allow the driveway to be placed in whichever of these areas provide the greatest separation from existing driveways table 2 minimum driveway spacing speed mph

defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection c of this section are met c an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  3 the industrial user has submitted the following information to the publicly owned treatment works potw and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission

user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 41289 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or

property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass the term severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b allowable bypasses an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c notice to publicly owned treatment works potw of needed or unanticipated bypass 1 if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the publicly owned treatment works potw at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an

bypass the publicly owned treatment works potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d prohibited  exceptions 1 bypass is prohibited and the publicly owned treatment works potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2 the publicly owned treatment works potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the publicly owned treatment works potw determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection d1 of this section
