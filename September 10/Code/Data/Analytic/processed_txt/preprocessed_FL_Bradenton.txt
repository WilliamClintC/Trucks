policy of the state to make it possible for the city to revitalize and preserve property values and prevent deterioration in the downtown area by a system of selfhelp to correct the blight of such deterioration which has developed there the authority hereby created is intended to provide a vehicle whereby property owners who will benefit directly from the results of such a program will bear the substantial cost thereof and thereby local problems may be solved on the local level use of machinery provided by local government 2 the legislature hereby finds and declares that the downtown area is a blighted area and that portions therein are slums the area constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues substantially impair or arrest the sound growth of said area retards the provision of housing accommodations aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities  that the prevention and elimination of such slums and blight is a matter of public policy and concern 3 it is further found and declared that certain portions of the slums and blighted areas require acquisition clearance and disposition subject to use restrictions as provided in this act since the prevailing conditions of deterioration and obsolescence makes impracticable the reclamation thereof by conservation or rehabilitation  that other portions of the downtown may means provided in this act be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner and the conditions hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated remedied or prevented  and that salvage slum and blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated public action as herein authorized and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of the property in such area 4 among the many causes of such slums and blight are the following automobile traffic flow is strangled by outmoded street patterns proliferation of uncoordinated uses and parking areas unsuitable topography faulty lot layouts fragmentation of land uses and parking areas necessitating frequent automobile movement lack of separation of pedestrian areas from auto traffic low level access bridge air pollution and excessive noise levels from strangled auto traffic voluntary cooperation for coordinated development is impracticable because of fragmentary ownership distant absentee ownership and unusual conditions of title and other conditions 5 the area is a business ghetto plagued with vacant and deteriorating buildings which are neglected and produce a depressing atmosphere many businesses of all types have left the area for new locations in suburban shopping centers and few businesses have entered to take their places the oldest commercial structures in the city are in this area and they are obsolete of inferior construction and incompatible with modern functional design as is featured in competitive shopping centers 6 the area now has few residences and most of the residences would not be permitted for new construction under the citys building code many former residents have left the area and few suitable residence facilities exist the area is predominantly commercial and is occupied primarily by day workers who sleep in suburban homes outside the downtown area 7 the only effective device for removal of the slums and blight of the downtown area is the planning and implementation of planning for appropriate land use beautification continuity of planning and aesthetic and technical design concepts the removal of deteriorated and obsolescent structures and the reduction of fragmentary control of properties in the area to implement such plans requires the exercise of the power of eminent domain so as to assemble land in pursuance of a coordinated program for redevelopment as authorized by this act  all of which is declared to be a public purpose and a public use 8 the legislature further finds and declares that the provisions of this act and the powers afforded to the governing board of the authority are essential to guide and accomplish the coordinated balanced and harmonious development of the downtown in accordance with existing and future needs to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the area and its inhabitants visitors property owners and workers to establish maintain and preserve aesthetic values and preserve and foster the development and display of attractiveness

 streets rollerskating it shall be unlawful for any person to skate with rollerskates in the street  street names a intent a wellplanned streetnaming system aids motorists in identifying destinations providing points of reference and contributes to safe traffic flow and contributes to the interest of public health safety and welfare public inconvenience should also be considered since changing an existing name may be disruptive and costly to residents and business owners b general standards the term street as used in this section may refer to any roadway used for automotive purposes the following general standards are applicable for all street names within the jurisdiction of the city 1 existing numbering pattern street names must follow the existing numbering pattern such as st street and nd avenue to maintain interconnectivity with the entire street grid private streets that are located within a gated community business park or planned development project that have two or less connections with existing streets outside of the community or project may be designated with nonnumbered names that are consistent with the theme of the development 2 hierarchy of streets while all streets are important more careful consideration will be given to the naming or renaming of higher order streets scenic highways and specific highway corridors in determining existing traffic systems a hierarchy of streets has been established according to various criteria including traffic volume ratio of traffic service to access service number of lanes and length of street segment 3 duplication of names exact and near duplication of street names is not permitted for example the use of both elm street and elm avenue may be confusing and should therefore be avoided it may be appropriate however for a minor subsidiary street to duplicate the primary name of a larger street with which it is associated eg island court a culdesac running off of island avenue it is preferable not to use names which sound alike or which might be confused with one another such as beach street and beech street 4 prohibited names it is desirable to use names which are simple and logical and which foster clarity and efficiency use of frivolous or complicated words or unconventional spellings in road names is prohibited names which might be reasonably perceived to be offensive are prohibited the use of alphabetical letters such as a street is generally prohibited 5 names of local relevance it is sometimes desirable to use names which have some association with the city and specifically with the immediate location of the street such as reference to historical residents or physiographic features uses of names which may be misleading in terms of association are strongly discouraged in order to preserve local history care should be exercised in changing historical names 6 naming streets after a person honoring an individual is a valid but secondary function of street naming as such it is desirable for there to be a direct association between the individual and the location of the named street in determining whether a street should be named in honor of a particular person consideration should be given to that persons relationship to the city character public image and contribution more thoughtful and careful consideration should be rendered in the nomination of a person who is still living younger in age or still engaged rather than retired in hisher career the size significance and classification of the thoroughfare should not be out of proportion to the significance of the individuals contribution however it should not be construed that ones contribution is small if hisher name is affixed to a lower order street a names given to arterials and collectors should be reserved for individuals whose contribution has clearly been of great significance to the citizens within and outside of the city a biographical profile of the individual for whom the street name is being requested may be required b naming of local streets after individuals is generally prohibited 7 segment identification a streets individuality should be easily definable continuous and unitary in its identity consideration will be favored toward the automobile driver and how the driver would expect to see a street name end or continue the minimum criteria for making this determination are as follows a termini a street should have two distinct and appropriate termini appropriate termini may include a street that dead ends or terminates at a t or y intersection  an abrupt change in compass direction  a jurisdictional boundary  a natural boundary such as a river or dramatic change in topography  or a change in street type or size b street direction a street name

proposals inclusive of any of the following attributes require design review architectural review by the citys design review committee a all new development located within the urban central business ucbd urban core uc and urban village uv districts excluding detached singlefamily dwellings b any new development or redevelopment of buildings with two or more living units within any district c additions and exterior changes to all structures providing for nonresidential uses and all structures with over three dwelling units existing prior to adoption of these land use regulations d all mixed use developments e new construction on property contiguous to a historic resource excluding singlefamily detached structures f new civic buildings or additions and exterior alterations to civic buildings standard design review requests are processed according to the procedural requirements of this chapter 60architectural review procedure 61  standard guidelines  context and architectural character proposed buildings should relate to the architectural characteristics of surrounding buildings especially historic buildings in order to be more compatible with their neighbors the intent is not necessarily to replicate or emulate historic buildings but to allow for a range of architectural expressions that complement the existing urban fabric therefore proposed building designs should be based on and reflect thorough analysis of their surrounding patterns with regard to the following  building orientation   horizontal and vertical building articulation   architectural style   building scale and proportion   roof line and form   fenestration pattern and detailing   architectural detailing   exterior finish materials and colors  and  lighting and landscape patterns even where there is no consistent architectural character or pattern found in the surrounding area building design and massing can be used to complement architectural characteristics of neighboring buildings in some cases where the existing context is not so welldefined or may be undesirable a proposed project can establish an architectural character and pattern from which future development can take its cues  building massing and articulation 1 each building should have at minimum a distinctive horizontal base  occupied middle  and eave cornice andor parapet line that complement and balance one another horizontal articulations can be produced by material changes or applied facade elements 2 each building should have a clear and harmonious pattern of verticallyoriented faade openings including entries windows and bays and columns or other exposed vertical supports vertical articulations can be produced by variations in rooflines  window groupings  applied faade elements such piers or pilasters bay windows and balconies  entrance stoops and porches  and subtle changes in materials and vertical planes that create shadow lines and textural differences vertical elements break up long monolithic building facades along the street in the ucdb and uc areas major vertical elements should be a maximum of 50 feet apart measured centertocenter which reflects the historic parcel increment of much of downtown in all other zones major vertical elements should be a maximum of 40 feet  apart measured centertocenter 3 in all districts other than ucbd uc and uv buildings should generally be designed to the scale and form of singlefamily houses 4 building base this may be as simple as a small projection of the wall surface andor a different material or color it may be created by a heavier or thicker design treatment of the entire ground floor for a building of two or more floors or by a setback of the upper floors 5 pattern of features windows wall panels pilasters building bays and storefronts should be based on a module derived from the buildings structural bay spacing features based on this module should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank uninteresting surfaces 6 building entrances to upper floors should be directly visible from the street and easy to identify a for buildings in the uv ucbd and uc i main building entrances should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from first floor storefronts at least one of the following treatments is recommended a marked by a taller mass above such as a tower or within a volume that protrudes from the rest of the building surface  b located in the center of the faade as part of a symmetrical overall composition  c accented by architectural elements such as columns overhanging roofs awnings and ornamental light fixtures  d marked or accented by a change in the roofline or change in the roof type e entries to shops or lobbies should be spaced a maximum of 50 feet apart ii corner buildings should provide prominent corner entrances for shops and other activitygenerating uses walls should be designed to be parallel to the rightofway b for buildings in other zones i a clear entry sequence should lead from the sidewalk to the front door the following elements are recommended a low hedges fences andor entry gates to define the edge between the public street and private property b stairs stoops and open porches are recommended to create attractive semipublic spaces 1 stairs all stairs should be boxed and framed by attractive stepped bulkheads walls or balustrade railings bullnose treads are recommended open or floating exterior stairs should not be used 2 open porches should have attractive bulkheads or balustrade railings and a roof that complements the pitch and materials of the main roof 3 ornamental lighting for porches and walks to add attractiveness safety and security 4 freestanding landscape elements such as trellises arbors and special landscape materials that add character to yard spaces andor accent the entry sequence 5 pedestrian access to subsurface parking garages should be provided along the building frontages to increase streetside pedestrian activity access ways could link directly to the main entrance stoopporch or be provided in a separate location in either case they should be designed as a prominent visible element in the overall faade composition  building walls 1 configuration a two or more wall materials may be combined on one faade only with one above the other lighter materials above those more substantial eg wood above stucco or masonry or stucco above masonry  dependent however upon the chosen style b all building elements that project from the building wall by more than 16 inches including but not limited to decks balconies porch roofs and bays shall be visibly supported by pilasters piers brackets posts columns or beams that are sized proportionally to the structure above this requirement does not apply to cantilevered elements that are typical for a specific style 2 wall surface materials a surfaces if the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex simple wall surfaces are preferable eg stucco  if the building volume and the pattern of wall openings are simple additional wall texture and articulation should be employed eg bricks or blocks rusticated stucco ornamental reliefs in both cases pilasters columns and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale b palette the palette of wall materials should be kept to a minimum preferably two eg stucco and tile brick and stone or less using the same wall materials as adjacent or nearby buildings helps strengthen the district character i brick brick veneers should be mortared to give the appearance of structural brick if used brick tile applications should use wraparound corner and bullnose pieces to minimize a veneer appearance ii stone and stone veneers are appropriate as a basic building material or as special material for wall panels or sills in combination with other materials such as brick or concrete iii pouredinplace concrete options in terms of formwork pigments and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces when used include accents such as ceramic tile or stone for decorative effect c ceramic tile ceramic tile is recommended as an accent material d stucco stucco andor painted stucco may be used in order to reduce maintenance and increase wear all stucco surfaces should be smooth to prevent the collection of dirt and surface pollutants and the deterioration of painted surfaces e wood siding painted horizontal lap wood or cementitious siding with detailed trim is the only recommended main street use of wood for residential application other wood siding configurations are acceptable f curtain wall systems curtain wall systems should only be used for limited areas such as connections between buildings entrance lobbies etc g parapet and cornice cap flashings note sheet metal parapet cap flashings should be painted to match wall or trim color h inappropriate wall surface materials i simulated finishes simulated finishes such as artificial or manmade stone ii wood shingles and shakes vertical board and batten shingles or shakes are not recommended in the ucbd and uc districts  they have a residential character iii plywood siding 3 side and rear building faades should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front faade particularly if they are visible from streets adjacent parking areas or residential buildings 4 blank wall areas without windows or doors are only permitted on internalblock sideproperty line walls such blank walls should reflect the ground level building increment building massing and organization and faade compositions guidelines a above surface reliefs decorative vines andor architectural murals and other surface enhancements should also be considered any blank exterior wall should also be treated with a graffitiresistant coating 5 color in general drab earth tones should not be used building walls should contrast trim colors  for example neutral or light walls with dark colors and saturated hues for accent and ornamental colors  white or light window and door trim on a medium or dark building wall colors of adjacent buildings should be taken into consideration a secondary color can be used to give additional emphasis to architectural features such as building bases like a wainscot plasters cornices capitals and bands b bright colors should be used sparingly typical applications are fabric awnings a restrained use of bright colors allows display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field  wall openings 1 windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality a unifying elements all windows within a building large or small should be related in operating type proportions and trim other unifying elements should be used such as common sill or header lines b for storefront buildings windowtowall proportion in general upper stories should have a windowtowall area proportion typically 30 percent to 50 percent that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts c window inset glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface  this is especially important for stucco buildings d frames and sills shaped frames and sills should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief they should be proportional to the glass area framed  eg a larger window should have thicker framing members e mullions true divided light windows or sectional windows are recommended where a divided window design is desired  snapin grilles or mullions should not be used f glazing clear glazing is strongly recommended reflective glazing should not be used if tinted glazing is used the tint should be kept as light as possible  green gray and blue are recommended g replacementrenovation wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type eg doublehung casement etc  vinylcovered wood windows are available for lower maintenance if aluminum replacement windows or doors are used they should be i same operating type and orientation as the original windows eg do not replace a double hung window with a horizontal sliding window a factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original  color anodized is also acceptable b similar in size and thickness to the original frame and mullions 2 storefronts are like small buildings with their own base roofline and pattern of window and door openings a base a panel of tile or other special material is recommended below display windows materials recommended for walls next section are generally suitable base materials should be the same or heavier materials visually than walls i brick and wood should only be used if the rest of the wall surface is the same material  neither material should be used exclusively ii ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base dark tile with light stucco is an effective combination different colors and sizes of tile may be used for decorative effect b display windows large pane windows encompassing a minimum of 60 percent of the storefront surface area are recommended where privacy is desired for restaurants professional services etc windows should be divided into smaller panes c clerestory windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and the second floor they are a traditional element of main street buildings and are recommended for all new or renovated storefronts clerestory windows can be good locations for neon paintedwindow and other relatively nonobtrusive types of signs d recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront recommended treatments include i special paving materials such as ceramic tile  ii ornamental ceilings such as coffering  iii decorative light fixtures e doors should be substantial and well detailed they are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel they should match the materials design and character of the display window framing narrowline aluminum frame doors are not recommended f cornices should be provided at the second floor or roofline for a onestory building to differentiate the storefront from upper levels of the building and to add visual interest  this also allows the storefront to function as the base for the rest of the building g new or renovated storefronts within historic buildings should emulate or recreate a previous storefront from historic photos or drawings in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture this can be flexibly interpreted for example when the general form of a new storefront is like the original but the materials are contemporary  roofs 1 forms roof forms should complement the building mass and match the principal building in terms of style detailing and materials doublepitched roofs such as gable hip pyramid dormer windows and chimneys are recommended to add variety and visual interest roofs of historic buildings in bradenton and neighboring areas should be used as an inspiration for new designs flat roofs are acceptable in the ucbd ad uc districts if a strong attractively detailed cornice andor parapet wall is provided singlepitched or shed roofs should not be used for the principal building 2 parapet walls are recommended  they should have a distinct shape or profile eg a gable arc or raised center 3 commercial mansards ie wraparound roofing panels that do not enclose a habitable floor or rooftop mechanical equipment should not be used 4 mansards should only be used when emulating a traditional building style that typically employs mansard roofs eg beaux arts victorian etc the following guidelines should apply a buildings are three stories or greater height  b they enclose no more and no less than one floor of habitable space  and c dormer windows and other architectural features should occupy a minimum of 25 percent of the roof length 5 accent elements such as flags cutout openings grilles and latticework ornamental medallions or building numbers are recommended 6 mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened preferably behind a parapet roof latticework louvered panels and other treatments that are compatible with the buildings architecture may also be appropriate 7 materials encouraged roof surface materials are identified as follows a clay ceramic or concrete tile colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes such as parapets domes and turrets b metal seam roofing should be anodized fluorocoated or painted copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized  miscellaneous building elements 1 trellises canopies awnings and other buildingmounted accessories a awnings are recommended they should be a colorful fabric mounted over a metal structure that is framed and attractive in design fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies backlit awnings are strongly discouraged b trellises and canopies materials colors and form should be derived from the building architecture c height and projection trellises canopies and awnings should be a minimum of nine feet above the sidewalk and project no more than seven feet out from the building wall d placement of trellises canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel they should not cover piers pilasters clerestory windows or other architectural features an individual awning or canopy for each storefront or building bay complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning does e accessories  ornamental brackets and poles should be used to add variety to the street hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts 2 accessory buildings a general outbuildings of all types should have architectural treatments derived from the main building surface materials trim fenestration roof materials and colors b freestanding garages should be unobtrusive preferably located at the rear of properties to minimize visual impact c singlecar garage doors are strongly recommended with windows surface panels trim and other forms of architectural detailing to reduce their impact and scale d builtin garages should blend with the form of the residence  site improvements 1 public and semipublic open space where provided as part of new development  eg pedestrian spaces arcades malls courtyards etc a spatial definition spaces should be defined by buildings or landscape elements on a minimum of two sides b linkage spaces should be publicly accessible during daylight hours and linked to adjacent streets and sidewalks c sequence gateways trellises special lighting planting etc should be used to create a sequence for pedestrians  for example an ornamental gate at the sidewalk a passage lined with columns and arrival at a courtyard 2 walls fences and piers should be used to define public and private boundaries and spaces a design walls fences and piers should be designed to be compatible with the character of the principal buildings i walls and fences should be open andor low along street frontages to maintain both a public character and sight distance for driveways where they occur ii fence and wall panels

such as sculpture wall murals and other paintings lighting displays and special public open spaces are encouraged i location of public art should be in highly visible places specifically designed or modified for the purpose of accommodating it  public art should not be located in semiprivate areas such as the rear of buildings or in courtyards ii symbolic content of public art should relate to and represent the rich history of the city where appropriate  abstract as well as literal representative elements are appropriate iii murals should reflect the color and architectural composition of the buildings on which they are painted and to the extent appropriate that of neighboring buildings murals are strongly recommended for exposed firewalls and other windowless wall areas that extend two or more floors above neighboring buildings see section  for specific use standards for public art murals f surface parking lots should be included in space defining elements such as arcades trellises columns light standards walls and railings stairs and ramps trees climbing vines arbors and hedges to provide visual interest  use of these elements should be consistent with the principal building and other site features 5 plant material and landscaping should contribute to a comfortable yet urban downtown environment drought tolerant plant materials should be used as appropriate a plant materials along street frontages should contribute to a harmonious and civic character i street trees shall be planted along all streets at a spacing of approximately 30 feet on center to create a buffer between pedestrians and automobiles consistency in tree species tree size and spacing should be used to establish a strong street identity ii trees with open branching structures should be

director of planning and community development v plant materials that exhibit annual or seasonal colorare recommended to highlight special locations eg flanking main building entries and driveways b plant materials in other locations should be selected and placed to reflect both ornamental and functional characteristics i deciduous trees  should be the predominant large plant material used they should be located adjacent to buildings and within parking areas to provide shade in summer and allow sun in winter species should be selected to be droughttolerant provide fall color and minimize litter and other maintenance problems ii evergreen shrubs and trees should be used as a screening device for example along rear property lines around mechanical appurtenances iii flowering shrubs and trees should be used where they can be most appreciated adjacent to walks and recreational areas or framing building entries stairs and walks iv plants with annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations such as courtyards building entrances or access drives v decorative vines should be considered for use along fences property boundaries perimeter walls and on blank building elevations vi palm trees should be used sparingly and only used to establish an identification of certain streets palms planted in other locations should be singular or in tight groupings so as not to compete with the visual importance of these streets vii droughttolerant andor native plants should generally be used c mounding earthfreestanding earth berms andor earth berms against buildings are a suburban landscape approach that are not appropriate in the downtown planning areas chapter 70  lighting 71  purpose this section chapter contains information and standards used for all development where lighting may be necessary  intent these outdoor lighting regulations intend to protect people and property values from the nuisance and harm of excessive outdoor lighting that a hinders or decreases visibility b glares into the eyes of drivers looking for safe nighttime visibility c creates a blinding brightness that leaves highcontrast unsafely dark shadowed areas d creates an artificial atmospheric flow that prevents residents from enjoying the night sky around their homes e spills into the yards homes and streets of neighborhoods trying to maintain a visually calm residential character  applicability unless exempted in exemptions section these lighting regulations apply to and require a lighting plan for a development and redevelopment of nonresidential projects multifamily dwelling residential projects and common improvements in other residential projects eg recreational facilities b outdoor lighting fixtures added to or intensified in nonresidential projects multifamily projects and common improvements in singlefamily residential projects eg vehicle use areas and recreational facilities routine maintenance eg cleaning and changing bulbs ballasts starters housings lenses and other similar components shall not constitute intensification provided such changes do not result in a higher lumen output compared to the fixture when new
