violations 1upset afor the purposes of this upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation ban upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c are met ca user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating lots or other relevant evidence that 1an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset 2the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures 3the user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within 5 days aa description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompli ance bthe period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue csteps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance din any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof eusers will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards fusers shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment

among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails 2prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in  183021a of this the specific prohibitions in  183021b3 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the borough was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 3bypass afor the purposes of this 1bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to be inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production ba user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this 1if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2a user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d1bypass is prohibited and the pretreatment coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless abypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage bthere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance cthe user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this 2the pretreatment coordinator after consulting with the superinten dent andor the borough manager andor the consulting engineer may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if they determine that it will meet the three conditions listed in subparagraph 1 of this 9201  14  18315miscellaneous provisions 1pretreatment charges and fees the borough may adopt

in accordance with the standards contained herein a orientation 1 be designed for energy efficient siting of buildings with respect to slopes and existing trees 2 southerly exposures should be utilized for development north slopes especially those over 10% slope should be avoided because the long shadows created severely restrict solar access 3 new lots and new residences shall be oriented to make maximum effective use of passive solar energy the long axis depth of each lot should run northsouth with a possible eastwest variation of 221 2 degrees lot design should provide for lots of adequate width 31 depth and slope for solar orientation lot layout should facilitate solar access by at least 75% of the proposed dwellings or buildings within a development 4 the largest yard setback should be stipulated on the south side of proposed buildings buildings should be situated to the north end of the lot to permit maximum onlot control of solar skyspace b streets 1 streets should be oriented along an eastwest axis with maximum northsouth deviations of 30 degrees this should be required to the maximum extent possible although size configuration or orientation of the property  nature of the surrounding development  circulation patterns  existing physical features such as topography and vegetation trees  and improved design potential may be considered to determine the feasibility of this requirement for a given site 2 street system shall be designed to reduce overall lengths and facilitate traffic flow minimum number of intersections 3 the street system shall be bordered by trees in accordance with standards of this the municipality c vegetation and wind 1 site design shall emphasize the preservation of all beneficial natural features of the site such as

plant materials which serve as wind barriers and aid in energy conservation 2 developments shall be designed to maximize wind buffering andor breeze channelization capabilities of vegetation topography and structure layouts wind breaks and buffers should utilize evergreens to protect north and northwesterly exposures cooling breezes from the southwest should be channeled past buildings deciduous trees shall be located in areas which will enable them to shade buildings from the summer sun but still allow penetration of the winter sun topography subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography ofland in order to utilize the natural contours economize in the construction of drainage facilities reduce the amount of grading and minimize destruction of trees and topsoil the natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the neighborhoods additionally environmental safeguards may be mandated on slopes in excess of 15% on steep slopes in excess of 15% site and lot design shall be adjusted where necessary to mitigate the detrimental effects of development on steeper slopes the following topographic considerations shall be utilized in design of subdivisions and land developments 32 a streets  land which is relatively flat or of very gentle slopes should be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage courses and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade on more irregular topography streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills and follow the ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines and adjusted however so that lots on one 1 side of the street will not be excessively below the street grade b natural drainage  subdivisions shall be designed particularly on land of very gentle slopes to take every advantage of natural grades so that all the land can be drained without excessive grading unless water courses or drainage ways are enclosed the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines shall be approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course and only where such plan is not possible should side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course easements for drainage ways and lowlying land which are subject to flooding may be included as part of a lot but shall not be used as building sites or included in calculating the required lot area or width c natural features  natural features irregularities changes in level brooks lakes hilltops and other focal points within the site and distant views outside the subdivision shall be integrated in the design to obtain variations and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive building sites trees topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved and utilized in the development of the subdivision d driveways  private driveways shall be designed to furnish safe and convenient access with reasonable clear sight distance at intersection with the street site improvements shall be required to insure adequate site visibility at the point of access and installation of a stable erosion resistant driveway surface driveway site distances shall be consistent with current penndot requirements specifications located in appendix and appropriate radii shall be provided steep slopes shall be traversed diagonally to minimize grades driveway grades shall not exceed 15% slope at any point all driveways shall be designed and improved with a rolled stone or paved surface sufficient to avoid erosion when driveway grades exceed 10% slope driveways shall be paved to minimize erosion required driveway improvements shall be guaranteed in accordance with of this 05 grading the developer shall grade each subdivision or land development to establish street grades floor elevations of buildings and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to existing topography however grading shall be kept to a minimum to avoid loss of topsoil and erosion potential be graded to secure drainage away from buildings the grading shall facilitate collection of storm water in designated areas and avoid concentration of water in the sewage system location the grading of the roadway shall extend the full width of the cartway shoulder and swale area if applicable where possible grass strips or channels between the curb or shoulder and rightofway line should be graded at 3 1 slope  however when unusual topographic conditions exist good engineering practice shall prevail 33 lot sizes and standards the

following criteria 1 the site is expected to generate 3000 or more average daily trips or 1500 vehicles per day 2 during any one hour time period of any day of the week the development is expected to generate 100 or more vehicle trips entering the site or 100 or more vehicle trips exiting the site 3 for existing sites being redeveloped the site is expected to generate 100 or more additional trips entering or exiting the development during any one hour time period of any day of the week 4 in the opinion of the lebanon county planning department lcpd the development or redevelopment is expected to have a significant impact on highway safety andor traffic flow even if none of the above warrants are met the lcpd is especially concerned about residential developments with one hundred 100 or more lots or dwelling units and nonresidential developments which will have more than one hundred 100 employees one hundred 100 parking spaces andor more than twentyfive 25 truck trips per day these proposed developments warrant a scoping meeting as discussed below if a tis is not warranted the lcpd may require the preparation of a transportation impact assessment tia some of the factors in determining if a tia is necessary include but are not limited to 45 1 location of proposed access and site configuration 2 congestion and delay of the surrounding roadway network andor 3 safety concerns the purpose of the tia is to assess the impact of the development on specific intersections andor on elements of state and local roads as such the scope of the tia will be limited and targeted to the concerns of the lcpd municipality or municipalities affected andor the pennsylvania department of transportation penn dot if state roads srs are involved in most cases the tia would be limited to an opening year analysis it is critical that before any work begins on a tis or tia that the applicant meets with the lcpd affected municipality or municipalities penn dot andor other key parties in a scoping meeting in order to clarify and agree upon the work to be performed and the time table for completion of the study or assessment in determining the need for a tis or tia the applicant should assume only one 1 access point  however major residential and commercial developments may require two 2 access points if the development has multiple stages or phases the warrant for the tis shall be based on new trips generated at full build out of the development the size of the study area for the tis or tia may range from a onehalf mile radius from the development out to several miles as outlined in the penn dot requirements the size of the study area and the roadsintersections involved in the tistia will be established during the scoping meeting a tis or tia needs to balance the safety and mobility of the traveling public with the needs and rights of property owners mitigating the impacts from development or redevelopment must occur tis or tia process the ultimate goal is to maintain a safe and efficient transportation system and to enable growth and developmentredevelopment where appropriate and sustainable a tis or a tia must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified professional who possesses a current professional engineers pe license issued by the pennsylvania department of state and preferably possessing a professional traffic operations engineer ptoe certificate all tiss or tias in lebanon county must comply with penn dots standards for these types of studies as are outlined in publication 170 if a penn dot highway
