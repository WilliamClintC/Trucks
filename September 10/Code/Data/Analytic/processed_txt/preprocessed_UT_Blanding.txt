definitions 874 stormwater utility 875 stormwater utility fee 876 billing 877 obstruction 878 dumping 879 violation and penalty 871 findings the city council makes the following findings regarding stormwater runoff and the citys stormwater system athe citys existing stormwater system consists of a network of manmade and natural facilities structures and conduits including ground water and aquifers that collect and route stormwater runoff bthe citys existing stormwater system does not adequately handle the stormwater runoff generated in the city cthe citys anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate stormwater system duncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff causes erosion and property damage euncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city funcontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff poses health hazards to the citizens of the community gstormwater has the potential to carry concentrations of oil grease nutrients chemicals heavy metals toxic materials and other undesirable materials that may jeopardize the integrity of ground waters and receiving water including the citys culinary water supply hall developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the stormwater system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces iall developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the citys operation and maintenance of the stormwater system jabsent effective maintenance operation regulation and control existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city may constitute a potential hazard to the health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and its businesses ka stormwater utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each property in the city pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the stormwater system  872 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to protect the health safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the citys stormwater system managing and controlling stormwater runoff protecting property preventing unwanted waters from entering the citys water supply and other receiving waters and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction operation and maintenance of a stormwater system  873 definitions the following words and phrases shall be defined as follows catch basin a basin combined with a storm drain inlet to trap solids debris any dirt rock sand tree or other rubbish litter etc detention basin a depression designed with an inlet and outlet that regulates water flow and allows debris to settle out that is capable of detaining stormwater runoff until it can be released without causing damage downstream developed parcel any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition by grading filling or the construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces drain inlet a point of entry into a sump detention basin or storm drain system equivalent residential unit eru the average amount of impervious surface expressed in square feet on developed singlefamily residential parcels in blanding impervious surface any hard surface other than the natural surface that prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rate of flow than the natural surface nonstormwater runoff any runoff other than stormwater storm drain a closed conduit for conducting stormwater that has been collected by inlets or collected by other means stormwater precipitation such as rain snow hail or other natural occurrence stormwater runoff water that is generated by stormwater flows overland sump a formalized structure underground surrounded by drain rock that acts as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the surrounding subsoil sumps usually receive stormwater runoff from paved areas such as streets parking lots building roofs etc  874 stormwater utility acreation the city council hereby creates and establishes a stormwater utility as part of the citys overall water system the stormwater utility shall plan design construct maintain administer and operate the citys stormwater system benterprise fund the city council hereby establishes a stormwater utility enterprise fund to handle all income expenses and other financial transactions related to the stormwater utility all stormwater utility service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund money in the stormwater utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other city funds without the consent of the city council the stormwater utility may pay other city funds for services and expenses directly attributable to the stormwater utility the enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy cfacilities and assets the stormwater utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities such as the water utility and the sanitary water water waste utility upon creation of the utility all of the citys stormwater facilities and assets other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city manager shall be transferred to the stormwater utility in consideration for the stormwater utilitys agreement to take primary responsibility for planning designing constructing maintaining administering and operating the citys stormwater system dadministration the stormwater utility shall be administered by the citys public works department  875 stormwater utility fee aimposed each developed parcel of real property in the city or undeveloped parcel which uses the citys stormwater system to dispose of irrigation water shall be charged a stormwater utility fee beru the fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential units erus contained in the parcel the city council finds that the eru is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the stormwater utility the city council finds and establishes that one eru equals three thousand 3000 square feet of impervious surface area ccalculation the city council finds that each singlefamily residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff  therefore each developed singlefamily residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one eru all nonsinglefamily residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate expressed in erus according to the measured impervious area on the parcel dcharge per eru the amount charged for each eru may be amended by resolution of the city council the following are the initial established stormwater rates stormwater rates  beginning april 2009 singlefamily residential monthly fee $100  fee per eru 100  residential singlefamily and duplex  $100 per month triplex and fourplex  200 per month apartments with more than 4 units  commercial rate commercial and industrial 3000 square feet of impervious surface equals eru$100 per month per eru  example a commercial business that has a total impervious surface area of 8900 square feet would have 3 erus 3 x $100   $300 per month note 1commercial and industrial parcels can receive a reduction for having on site mitigation ecredit for on site mitigation nonresidential parcels having constructed on site stormwater detention retention or mitigation management facilities will be eligible for a service charge credit as follows fifty percent 50% reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards with a maximum release from the basin of 020 cfsac within a landscaped area on site and having installed an approved sand and oil interceptor system before discharging into the citys storm drain system thirty percent 30% reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards with a maximum release from the basin of 020 cfsac within a landscaped area or a retention basin within a landscaped area on site twenty percent 20% reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards of a maximum release of 020 cfsac within an impervious surface area on the site or within a piping system designed for detention on site fexemptions and credits the city council may establish exemptions and credits to the stormwater utility fee by resolution gpolicies the public works department may adopt policies consistent with this chapter and any resolutions passed by the city council to assist in the application administration and
