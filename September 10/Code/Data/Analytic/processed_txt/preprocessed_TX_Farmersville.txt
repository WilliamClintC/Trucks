interest all streets shall be constructed in accordance with the citys design manual and standard construction details b alleys no alleys shall be required if provided or constructed by the developer alleys shall conform to the adopted design manual and standard construction details c adequacy of streets and thoroughfares 1 responsibility for adequacy of streets and thoroughfares the property owner shall assure that the subdivision is served by adequate streets and thoroughfares and shall be responsible for the costs of all rightsofway and street improvements adjacent to the development in accordance with the following policies and standards and subject to the citys cost participation policies on oversized facilities 2 general adequacy policy every subdivision shall be served by improved streets and thoroughfares adequate to accommodate the vehicular traffic to be generated by the development proposed streets shall provide a safe convenient and functional system for traffic circulation  shall be properly related to the citys thoroughfare plan road classification system comprehensive plan and any amendments thereto  and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each development 3 road network new subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate capacity ingressegress and safe and efficient traffic circulation the adequacy of the road network for developments of 100 or more dwelling units or for developments generating 5000 or more oneway trips per day or for developments involving collector or arterial streets not appearing on the citys adopted thoroughfare plan or where deemed required by the city engineer shall be demonstrated by the preparation and submission along with the concept plan or preliminary plat application of a traffic impact analysis the traffic impact analysis shall be prepared in accordance with section 6545 the traffic impact analysis shall take into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property if the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed the city council may require a demonstration of the adequacy of the road network pursuant to this section for any or all additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed concept plan or plat if the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project the city may require an update of the study for later phases of the development if the concept plan or plat conforms with the thoroughfare plan and if the concept plan or plat is for a development of less than 100 dwelling units or for a development generating less than 5000 oneway trips per day then a traffic impact analysis may be required at the discretion of the city engineer 4 offsite improvements where a traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for such facilities the property owner shall make such improvements to offsite collector and arterial streets and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or related developments 5 dedication of rightofway the property owner shall provide all rightsof way required for existing or future streets and for all required street improvements including perimeter streets and approach roads as shown in the thoroughfare plan design manual and standard construction details or other valid development plans approved by city council in the case of perimeter streets at least onehalf of the total required rightofway width for such streets shall be provided unless the proposed development is on both sides of the street in which case the full rightofway width shall be provided in some instances more than onehalf of the required rightofway width shall be required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual or proposed alignment of the street such as in the case of a curved street as may be required by the city council a perimeter streets where an existing halfstreet is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition the other onehalf of the street shall be dedicated and an appropriate amount of the street shall be improved by the developer of the subdivision or addition b slope easements the dedication of easements in addition to dedicated rightsofway shall be required whenever due to topography additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes such slopes

installed as warranted in accordance with the traffic impact analysis construction and design standards shall be in accordance with the citys design manual and standard construction details 7 phased development where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases the applicant in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat shall provide a schedule of development the schedule shall set forth the intended plan of development and dedication of rightsofway for streets and street improvements whether onsite or offsite intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision the city engineer shall determine whether the proposed phasing of any streets and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established and may require that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the city determines to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be adequately served by the phased dedication and construction of such streets and thoroughfares 8 arrangement of streets not shown on the thoroughfare plan for streets that are not shown on the citys thoroughfare plan such as local residential streets the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall a provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas including at least two points of access  b conform to a special area plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the city council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical  c provide for additional future access such as by stubbing out streets for future extension to the outer boundary of the subdivision to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or for a similar type of land use  and d not conflict in any way with existing or logically anticipated driveway openings 9 collector and residential streets residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by will be discouraged such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions wherever the rightofway width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width such transition shall occur along the front side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots and shall not occur within the street intersection itself in other words the rightofway width shall be the same on both sides of any street intersection 10 adjacency of residential properties where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street the city council may require marginal access streets reverse frontage lots which back onto the arterial deep lots with rear service alleys or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of local traffic 11 reserve strips reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is required by the city and approved by the city council 12 half streets construction of half streets shall be prohibited except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of this chapter and the thoroughfare plan and where the city council makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question the city council may also find that it would be more practical or cost effective to delay construction of the other onehalf of a street until the adjoining property is developed if the property owner is responsible for onehalf of the street then the property owner shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility including all applicable street appurtenances such as median openings left turn lanes into the development sidewalks drainage structures etc whenever a partial street has been previously platted along a common property line the other portion of the street rightofway shall be dedicated such that the rightofway is increased to the streets ultimate planned width improvements shall be made to all onsite facilities as defined herein see definitions section 6511 13 perimeter streets and associated improvements when a proposed subdivision whether residential or nonresidential abuts on one or both sides of an existing substandard street or on a planned or future road as shown on the thoroughfare plan being substandard according to the then existing current thoroughfare plan the developer shall be required to improve his or her reasonable share of the existing onsite facility as that term is defined herein including appurtenant sidewalks screening and landscaping storm drainage structures water quality or erosion controls and other onsite facilities as defined in section 6511 to bring the same to city standards or to replace it with a standard city street as determined by the traffic impact analysis if required and at no cost to the city a the developers share of improvements to a substandard perimeter road shall be at least 25 feet of pavement including curb if any which is approximately equivalent to onehalf 50 percent of a collector street width ie two lanes along the entire front footage of the subdivision unless the traffic impact analysis if required indicates that some other pavement width is necessary to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of service on the roadway if the subdivision is to be located on both sides of the roadway at least 25 feet of pavement shall be constructed by the developer on each side of the road along the entire front footage of the subdivision on each respective side of the road unless the traffic impact analysis indicates that some other pavement width is necessary to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of service on the roadway design and construction of the roadway shall be in accordance with the citys thoroughfare plan with respect to rightofway width and general location the design manuals and with any other applicable city codes and ordinances b depending upon the specific roadway in question and upon the traffic impact analysis results any oversizing above the minimum 25 feet width may be borne by the city the county the state or by some other entity to the extent that the cost of oversizing exceeds the subdivisions roughly proportionate impact the city council may at its option accept escrow funds in lieu of immediate roadway construction if the subdivision derives principal access from another improved roadway and if delaying construction and improvement of the road will not harm or otherwise inconvenience neighboring property owners or the general public c streets which deadend at power lines or similar rightsofway or easements and which are intended for future extension across these rightsofway or easements shall be constructed in the rightofway or easement for half the distance across the rightofway or easement and shall be further restricted as set forth in subsection c14 a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling the deadend streets that will at some point be extended across the power line easement or rightofway and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub such as on the barricade also stating that the street will be extended in the future signage size and lettering shall be in accordance with the city requirements 14 deadend streets except in unusual cases no deadend streets will be approved unless such deadend streets are provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land in the case of deadend streets which will eventually be extended into the adjacent subdivision no more than one lot per side can front onto the deadend street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb with an offsite easement is provided at the end a temporary deadend street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal culdesac and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like a culdesac however the city engineer may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc or wing portions of the temporary turnaround bulb in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any deadend streets if any that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub such as on the barricade also stating that the street will be extended in the future signage and lettering must be large enough to be legible by a person with normal vision at a 20foot distance any required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat along with their appropriate recording information if they are offsite or established by separate instrument 15 extension of existing streets new streets that extend existing streets shall be dedicated at equal or greater rightofway widths than the existing streets or as otherwise required by the citys thoroughfare development plan and approved by the city engineer 16 construction of new streets all new streets within a subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the design manual and standard construction details of the city at the time at which the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application 17 points of access all subdivisions shall have at least two points of access from improved public roadways also see section 6541 driveway access onto roadways shall be provided and designed in accordance with the citys design manual and construction details that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application 18 street lights all street lighting shall be installed in conformance with the citys zoning ordinance mercury vapor luminaries shall not be accepted all fixtures shall be hooded in a way that directs all lighting downward 19 street names street names must be submitted to the city for review and approval as a part of the preliminary plat application and shall become fixed at the time of approval of the preliminary plat on the final plat street names shall not be changed from those that were approved on the preliminary plat unless special circumstances have caused the major realignment of streets or a proposed street names is discovered to have already been used elsewhere in the city or some other similar eventuality if additional street names are needed for the final plat then they must be submitted for review and approval by the city the us postal service and applicable emergency service providers including 911 along with the final plat application a fee may be established by the city for the changing of street names after approval of the preliminary plat a surnames of people or the names of corporations or businesses shall not be used as street names unless approved by the city council the city will maintain a list of existing street names and reserved street names that have been approved on a preliminary plat and will update the list as new streets are platted b new street names shall not duplicate existing street names for example smith street vs smythe street  oak drive vs oak place vs oak court vs oak circle  cascade drive vs cascading drive  shall not be so similar as to cause confusion between names for example lakeside drive vs lake side drive vs lake siding drive  and shall not sound like existing street names when spoken for example oak drive vs doak drive vs cloak drive  lantern way vs land tern way suffixes shall be in agreement when a street is extended for example oak street cannot extend oak drive c new streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets streets crossing thoroughfares or other roadways shall bear the same name on both sides of the thoroughfare wherever practical a culdesac or loop that is named after another such as oak court or oak circle or oak trail must actually connect to the main street oak from which the name is derived d the property owner shall install all street name signs and poles for the development installation shall be complete prior to approval of the engineering plans by the city engineer e street name signs as specified by the city shall be installed in accordance with the citys guidelines before issuance of a
