goods or services in question public notice and bid require publication of the contract requirements in a newspaper and receipt of closed bids from the interested vendors the ordinance does not require awarding of the contract to the lowest bidder and the town has the discretion to award any contract to other than the highest bidder if it determines in its discretion that it would be in the

environment for small scale businesses that are appropriate for the village areas development of these villages with mixed residential and limited business uses with detailed design review will add an incentive for investments in measures to protect the historic qualities of the village including its historic buildings the regulations have been enacted pursuant to j of the cgs to allow for creative and complementary development techniques as an addendum to these regulations the commission has prepared separate guidelines that will include property ratings for each village property this prioritizes a property for its significance archictecturally and physically and general design techniques for the specific village these guidelines are to reflect the unique character of the specific village for example preston city village design guidelines will reflect the design techniques that complement the character of preston city village and shall be used to aid the intent of the regulations and the specific objective for the specific village for the purpose of this section a historic building is as listed on the national register of historic places registration form as a

seventeenth to the twentieth centuries this truly authentic new england village has a distinct character that reflects the rural atmosphere of the town historically preston city has functioned as an agricultural social and business center the district is located within the watershed area for amos lake a prominent and significant natural and recreational resource in order to protect this significant resource and its watershed development within this district is subject to of these regulations b poquetanuck village district poquetanuck village is listed on the national register of historic places similar to preston city poquetanuck village has traditionally housed a mixture of land uses at a higher density the village settled in the 17th century was the site of early settlement with coastal trading lumber production iron making and shipbuilding as the major industries the village generally encompasses a winding portion of route 2a that extends from the bridge over halls brook to the intersection with route 117 with 2 intersecting roads brickyard road and cider mill road the village is bordered by the sensitive natural and archaeological resources of poquetanuck cove in order to protect the significant cove resources and its watershed development within this district is subject to of these regulations  objective preston city village and poquetanuck village from their inception to the present contain both residential and nonresidential uses 53 they are recognized as special places and assets of the town as evidenced by its inclusion in the national register of historic places as historic districts for these reasons preston city village district and poquetanuck village district were created the objective is to improve upon the village character by creating more cohesive and defined villages that reflect the small town rural atmosphere complements the preston city and poquetanuck village national register historic districts promotes social and economic vitality and enhances sense of community and place thereby resulting in an improved quality of life for the residents and taxpayers of the town of preston promoting development of preston

method to diversify housing opportunities within the town of preston in order to encourage affordable housing opportunities within the municipality with the goal of achieving the affordable housing threshold of ten percent 10% of the total housing units in the town of preston the planning and zoning commission desires to encourage affordable housing with the town of preston in a manner that will achieve the following objectives a to allow on a long term basis for the development of diverse housing types including affordable housing to help address identified housing needs within the town of preston b to encourage the construction of housing that is both affordable as defined by connecticut general statute g et seq and is consistent with design and construction standards present in the community  c to promote housing choice including affordable housing for low and moderate income households  d to efficiently utilize infrastructure and promote neighborhood planning by providing where infrastructure support is available a mix of housing types densities sizes and prices while also providing public and private open space and recreational areas  e to guide development complying with the criteria established in this regulation in a manner consistent with the statutory purpose of protecting the public health safety convenience and property values  and f to encourage energyefficient patterns of development the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy and energy conservation it is therefore the intent of this regulation to create within the town of preston affordable housing development districts ahd the ahd will be a floating zone governed by a master plan prepared in accordance with these regulations the master plan will be subject to review and approval by the commission as a zone change subject to a public hearing and all other applicable terms and conditions of these 60 regulations it is recognized that the master plan may require fluidity in order to accommodate market changes that may dictate the need for changes in the design of the affordable housing project during the course of completion of development of the project in the event that there is any substantial and material change proposed for the master plan as determined by the commission the change will be subject to the same procedural requirements for a zone change as required by the original zone change application adopting the ahd once enacted the ahd will supersede all preexisting zoning and any development on the zoned property will be subject to the specific ahd requirements
