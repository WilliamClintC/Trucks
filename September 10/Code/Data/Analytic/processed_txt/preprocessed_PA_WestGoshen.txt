determining the sewer rentals 3 in cases where persons use water from the water supplier andor from any other source such that all or any part of the water so used is not discharged into the sewer

of the sewer manager it is not appropriate or not practical to install devices to continuously determine the quantity of water not discharged to the sewer system the sewer manager will determine in

chapter shall be known as the west goshen township stormwater management   712 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities  contributes to erosion and sedimentation  overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers  greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater  undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities  reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge  increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways  and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems costeffective and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces reduce disturbance of land and natural resources avoid sensitive areas ie riparian buffers floodplains steep  711 speedtiming devices  712 69a303  713 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to protect public health safety and general welfare property and water quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management practices criteria and provisions included herein for land development construction and earth disturbance activities to achieve the following throughout the municipality slopes wetlands etc and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater g federal and state regulations require the municipality to implement a program of stormwater controls the municipality is required to obtain a permit and comply with its provisions for stormwater discharges from its separate storm sewer system under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes h nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth a reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting people property infrastructure and public services b sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of groundwater and surface waters c protect natural resources including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats d maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and their receiving watersheds e minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features drainage patterns infiltration and flow conditions within land development site designs f reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated and manage and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible g provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to protect groundwater supplies and stream baseflows prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources h reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the chemical physical and biological quality of ground and surface waters i reduce scour erosion and sedimentation of stream channels j reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying capacity of streams and their floodplains  712 west goshen township code  713 69a304 k
