the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the borough of audubon of camden county new jersey does ordain as follows  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the borough are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the

highwater table area is located shall be permitted as a conditional use subject to the planning boards finding after recommendation of the borough engineer that the following conditions prevail 1 that sufficient fill material will or has been installed to raise the level of the proposed building or other structure to such a degree that in the boards opinion there will be no potential hazard from the highwater table 2 that the type of building or other structure proposed is so designed that no harmful effect is likely to result from a possible highwater table 3 that there will be no interruption to the natural surface water flow and no impounding of surface water will result from the placement of fill to overcome the harmful effects of a possible highwater table 4 that placement of fill material on the lot in question will not cause the highwater table to be relocated on property previously not within the highwater table b boundary lines modified in accordance with
