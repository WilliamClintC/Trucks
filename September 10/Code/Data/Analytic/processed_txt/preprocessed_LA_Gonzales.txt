property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy

purposes of classification and at the editors discretion with the concurrence of the city these provisions have been included as  2812826 article i  general provisions introduction purpose and intent during the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes clearing and grading during construction can also cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat postconstruction new developments have a tendency to increase impervious land surfaces due to the addition of hard surface roads sidewalks and foundations which may lead to increased volume and levels of pollutants in stormwater discharges the purpose of this chapter is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment during construction and postconstruction additionally it has been determined that proper management of construction stormwater runoff and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this chapter seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum construction and postconstruction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum construction and postconstruction stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and longterm follow up  22210 applicability this chapter shall be applicable to all land development including but not limited to site plan applications subdivision applications and grading

replacement of one 1 acre or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activity of one 1 acre or more  3 any new development or redevelopment regardless of size that is defined by the city of gonzales to be a hotspot land use  or 4 land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items 1 and 2 above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules  22210 administration the city of
