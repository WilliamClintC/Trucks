adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments c sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows furthermore adult bookstores tend to attract customers who engage in unprotected highrisk sexual activities d offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions e persons frequent certain adult theaters and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses  361 adult uses  361  f at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a

transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn child h according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts i sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities j numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films k numerous studies have indicated that sexually oriented businesses have a substantial negative impact on property values and cause neighborhood blight l the findings noted in 2a k raise substantial governmental concerns 3 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare 4 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 5 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in  361 jackson code  361  possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 6 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult facilities 7 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 8 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 9 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 10 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 11 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 12 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter 13 the limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses from  am to  pm mondays closure of such businesses on sundays and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes the public health safety and welfare 14 the reasonable regulation and supervision of sexually oriented businesses tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution and  361 adult uses  361   362 definitions as used in this chapter the following words and

eventually serve 1500 to 3500 vehicles per day all existing collector streets within jackson township are currently classified by the comprehensive plan as rural minor collectors collector streets within jackson township are divided into the following types major collector streets  this type of collector street is designed to provide service to towns that are not served by streets with a higher classification and to other traffic generators of equivalent intercounty importance and then to link this traffic with nearby larger towns and routes of higher classification this type of street also serves important intercounty travel corridors 1 minor collector streets  this type of collector street is designed to be spaced at intervals consistent with population density to collect traffic from local streets and bring all developed areas within a reasonable distance of a collector street this type of street also provides service to the remaining smaller communities and links locally important traffic generators with the rural hinterland 2 b local street or local access street  this type of street primarily is designed to provide access to adjacent land and provide travel over

are no outstanding matters  except where exempted by  11329 b sketch plan while a sketch plan is not required it is strongly recommended that it be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and informally with the planning commission before preparing a preliminary plan this will often avoid expensive redesign and delay to the applicant  11322 sewers  11323   11324 general plan submission procedures c preliminary plan preliminary plans are required to be submitted for any major subdivision and for certain land developments as described above d final plan after approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision or certain land developments and to obtain approval of a minor subdivision the applicant files a final plan a final plan must be approved by the township board of supervisors prior to recording of the plans at the county recorder of deeds office and prior to the sale of any lots or the construction of any buildings see  e guaranty of improvements installation where improvements are required by this chapter in most cases the township will require that the applicant enter into a development agreement andor require the posting of financial security sufficient to guarantee the costs of any improvements which may be required see  a submission sketch preliminary and final plans and all required accompanying information are required to be submitted to the township staff by delivery in person b attendance the applicant or hisher duly authorized representative should endeavor to attend the commission meeting to discuss the filed plans if
