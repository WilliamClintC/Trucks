acknowledged even as the council may agree to disagree on contentious issues 214 administration and government in public meetings practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate difficult questions tough challenges to a particular point of view and criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action this does not allow however council members to make belligerent personal impertinent slanderous threatening abusive or disparaging comments no shouting or physical actions will be tolerated honor the role of the chair in maintaining order it is the responsibility of the chair to keep the comments of council members on track during public meetings council members should honor efforts by the chair to focus discussion on current agenda items if there is disagreement about the agenda or the chairs actions those objections should be voiced politely and with reason following procedures outlined in parliamentary procedure avoid personal comments that could offend other council members if a council member is personally offended by the remarks of another council member the offended council member should make notes of the actual words used and call for a point of personal privilege that challenges the other council member to justify or apologize for the language used the chair will maintain control of this discussion demonstrate effective problemsolving approaches council members have a public stage to show how individuals with disparate points of view can find common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the community as a whole in private encounters continue respectful behavior in private the same level of respect and consideration of differing points of view that is deemed appropriate for public discussions should be maintained in private conversations be aware of the insecurity of written notes voice mail messages and email 215 administration and government technology allows words written or said without much forethought to be distributed wide and far would you feel comfortable to have this note faxed to others how would you feel if this voice mail message was played on a speaker phone in a full office what would happen if this email message was forwarded to others written notes voice mail messages and email should be treated as potentially public communication even private conversations can have a public presence elected officials are always on display  their actions mannerisms and language are monitored by people around them that they may not know lunch table conversations will be eavesdropped upon parking lot debates will be watched and casual comments between individuals before and after public meetings noted council conduct with city staff governance of a city relies on the cooperative efforts of elected officials who set policy and city staff who implements and administers the councils policies therefore every effort should be made to be cooperative and show mutual respect for the contributions made by each individual for the good of the community treat all staff as professionals clear honest communication that respects the abilities experience and dignity of each individual is expected poor behavior toward staff is not acceptable limit contact to specific city staff questions of city staff andor requests for additional background information should be directed only to the city manager the city manager should be copied on any request except those to the city attorney requests for followup or directions to staff should be made only city manager or the city attorney when appropriate when in doubt about what staff contact is appropriate council members should ask the city manger for direction materials supplied to a council member in response to a request will be made available to all members of the council so that all have equal access to information 216 administration and government never publicly criticize an individual employee council should never express

should check with city staff to see if an official city response has already been sent or is in progress do not attend meetings with city staff unless requested by staff even if the council member does not say anything the council members presence implies support shows partiality intimidates staff and hampers staffs ability to do their job objectively limit requests for staff support routine secretarial support will be provided to all council members all mail for council members mail addressed to the mayor is reviewed first by the city manager who notes suggested action andor followup items requests for additional staff support  even in high priority or emergency situations  should be made to the city manager who is responsible for allocating city resources in order to maintain a professional wellrun city government council members should not solicit any type of political support financial contributions display of posters or lawn signs name on support list etc from city staff city staff may as private citizens with constitutional rights support political candidates but all such activities must be done away from the workplace 217 administration and government council conduct with the public in public meetings making the public feel welcome is an important part of the democratic process no signs of partiality prejudice or disrespect should be evident on the part of individual council members toward an individual participating in a public forum every effort should be made to be fair and impartial in listening to public testimony be welcoming to speakers and treat them with care and gentleness i give many public presentations so standing up in front of a group is not new to me but i found that speaking in front of council was an entirely different experience i was incredibly nervous and my voice was shaking i think the reason was because the issue was so personal to me the council was going to take a vote that would affect my familys daily life and my home i was feeling a lot of emotion the way that council treats people during public hearings can do a lot to make them relax or to push their emotions to a higher level of intensity be fair and equitable in allocating public hearing time to individual speakers the first thing the mayor said to me was to be brief because the meeting was running late and the council was eager to go home that shouldnt be my problem im sorry my item was at the end of the agenda and that there were a lot of speakers but it is critically important to me and i should be allowed to say what i have to say and believe that the council is listening to me no speaker will be turned away unless he or she exhibits inappropriate behavior each speaker may only speak once during the public hearing unless the council requests additional clarification later in the process after the close of the public hearing no more public testimony will be accepted unless the chair reopens the public hearing for a limited and specific purpose give the appearance of active listening it is disconcerting to speakers to have council members not look at them when they are speaking it is fine to look down at documents or to make notes but reading for a long period of time gazing around the room gives the appearance of disinterest be aware of facial expressions especially those that could be interpreted as smirking disbelief anger or boredom if speakers become flustered or defensive by council questions it is the responsibility of the chair to calm and focus the speaker and to maintain the order and decorum of the meeting questions by council members to members of the public testifying should seek to clarify or expand information 218 administration and government it is never appropriate to belligerently challenge or belittle the speaker council members personal opinions or inclinations about upcoming votes should not be revealed until after the public hearing is closed no personal attacks of any kind under any circumstance council members should be aware that their body language and tone of voice as well as the words they use can appear to be intimidating or aggressive follow parliamentary procedure in conducting public meetings the city manger serves as advisory parliamentarian for the city and is available to answer questions or interpret situations according to parliamentary procedures final rulings on parliamentary procedure are made by the chair in unofficial settings make no promises on behalf of the council council members will frequently be asked to explain a council action or to give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community it is appropriate to give a brief overview of city policy and to refer to city staff for further information it is inappropriate to overtly or implicitly promise council action or to promise city staff will do something specific fix a pothole remove a library book plant new flowers etc make no personal comments about other council members it is acceptable to publicly disagree about an issue but it is unacceptable to make derogatory comments about other council members their opinions and actions remember that despite its impressive population figures coweta is a small town at heart council members are constantly being observed by the community every day that they serve in office their behaviors and comments serve as models for proper deportment in the city of coweta honesty and respect for the dignity of each individual should be reflected in every word and action taken by council members 24 hours a day seven days a week it is a serious and continuous responsibility 219 administration and government council conduct with other public agencies be clear about representing the city or personal interests if a council member appears before another governmental agency or organization to give a statement on an issue the council member must clearly state 1 if his or her statement reflects personal opinion or is the official stance of the city  2 whether this is the majority or minority opinion of the council if the council member is representing the city the council member must support and advocate the official city position on an issue not a personal viewpoint if the council member is representing another organization whose position is different from the city the council member should withdraw from voting on the issue if it significantly impacts or is detrimental to the citys interest council members should be clear about which organizations they represent and inform the mayor and council of their involvement correspondence also should be equally clear about representation city letterhead may be used when the council member is representing the city and the citys official position a copy of official correspondence should be given to the city manager for filing as part of the permanent public record it is best that city letterhead not be used for correspondence of council members representing a personal point of view or a dissenting point of view from an official council position however should council members use city letterhead to express a personal opinion the official city position must be stated clearly so the reader understands the difference between the official city position and the minor viewpoint of the council member council conduct with boards and commissions the city has established several boards and commissions as a means of gathering more community input citizens who serve on boards and commissions become more involved in government and serve as advisors to the city council they are a valuable resource to the citys leadership and should be treated with appreciation and respect if attending a board or commission meeting be careful to only express personal opinions 220 administration and government council members may attend any board or commission meeting which are always open to any member of the public however they should be sensitive to the way their participation  especially if it is on behalf of an individual business or developer  could be viewed as unfairly affecting the process any public comments by a council member at a board or commission meeting should be clearly made as individual opinion and not a representation of the feelings of the entire city council limit contact with board and commission members to questions of clarification it is inappropriate for a council member to contact a board or commission member to lobby on behalf of an individual business or developer it is acceptable for council members to contact board or commission members in order to clarify a position taken by the board or commission remember that boards and commissions serve the community not individual council members the city council appoints individuals to serve on boards and commissions and it is the responsibility of boards and commissions to follow policy established by the council but board and commission members do not report to individual council members nor should council members feel they have the power or right to threaten board and commission members with removal if they disagree about an issue appointment and reappointment to a board or commission should be based on such criteria as expertise ability to work with staff and the public and commitment to fulfilling official duties a board or commission appointment should not be used as a political reward be respectful of diverse opinions a primary role of boards and commissions is to represent many points of view in the community and to provide the council with advice based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives council members may have a closer working relationship with some individuals serving on boards and commissions but must be fair and respectful of all citizens serving on boards and commissions keep political support away from public forums board and commission members may offer political support to a council member but not in a public forum while conducting official duties conversely council members may support board and commission members who are running for office but not in an official forum in their capacity as a council member 221 administration and government inappropriate behavior can lead to removal inappropriate behavior by a board or commission member should be noted to the mayor and the mayor should counsel the offending member if inappropriate behavior continues the mayor should bring the situation to the attention of the council and the individual is subject to removal from the board or commission council conduct with the media council members are frequently contacted by the media for background and quotes the best advice for dealing with the media is to never go off the record most members of the media represent the highest levels of journalistic integrity and ethics and can be trusted to keep their word but one bad experience can be catastrophic words that are not said cannot be quoted the mayor is the official spokesperson for the citys position the mayor is the designated representative of the council to present and speak on the official city position if an individual council member is contacted by the media the council member should be clear about whether their comments represent the official city position or a personal viewpoint choose words carefully and cautiously comments taken out of context can cause problems be especially cautious about humor sardonic asides sarcasm or word play it is never appropriate to use personal slurs or swear words when talking with the media sanctions public disruption members of the public who do not follow proper conduct after a warning in a public hearing may be barred from further testimony at that meeting or removed from the council chambers inappropriate staff behavior council members should refer to the city manager any city staff that does not follow proper conduct in their dealings with council members other city staff or the public these employees may be disciplined in accordance with standard city procedures for such actions 222 administration and government council members behavior and conduct city council members who intentionally and repeatedly do not follow proper conduct may be reprimanded or formally censured by the council lose seniority or committee assignments either within the city of coweta or with intergovernment agencies or have official travel restricted serious infractions of the ethics or conduct could lead to other sanctions as deemed appropriate by council council members should point out to the offending council member infractions of the conduct if the offenses continue then the matter should be referred to the mayor in private if the mayor is the individual whose actions are being challenged then the matter should be referred to the vice mayor it is the responsibility of the mayor to initiate action if a council members behavior may warrant sanction if no action is taken by the mayor the alleged violations can be brought up with the full council in a public meeting if violation of the conduct is outside of the observed behaviors by the mayor or council members the alleged violation should be referred to the mayor the city council should ask the city manager andor the city attorney to investigate the allegation and report the findings to the city council it is the city councils responsibility to take the next appropriate action these actions can include but are not limited to discussing and counseling the individual on the violations  recommending sanction to the full council to consider in a public meeting  or forming a council ad hoc subcommittee to review the allegation  the investigation and its findings as well as to recommend sanction options for council consideration videotaping of the complaint hearing should be used for a council ad hoc subcommittee principles of proper conduct proper conduct is  keeping promises being dependable building a solid reputation participating and being available demonstrating patience showing empathy 223 administration and government holding onto ethical principles under stress listening attentively studying thoroughly keeping integrity intact overcoming discouragement going above and beyond time and time again modeling a professional manner proper conduct is not  showing antagonism or hostility deliberately lying or misleading speaking recklessly spreading rumors stirring up bad feelings divisiveness acting in a

introduction the principles of erosion and sedimentation control can be successfully formulated and implemented by understanding the basic processes of soil erosion and sedimentation there is a certain amount of erosion and sedimentation that occurs in nature the process of natural erosion and sedimentation is greatly accelerated due to construction activity if the accelerated process is not accounted for at the time of construction the adverse effects possible are a a large increase in area exposed to storm water runoff and soil erosion b increased volumes of storm runoff accelerated soil erosion and sediment yield and higher peak flows caused by 1 removal of protective vegetative cover 2 exposure of underlying soil or geologic formations less pervious andor more erodible than original soil surface 3 reduced capacity of exposed soils to absorb rainfall due to compaction caused by heavy equipment 4 enlarged drainage areas caused by grading operations diversions and street construction 64 5 shortened times of concentration of surface runoff caused by altering steepness distance and surface roughness and installation of improved storm drainage facilities 6 increased impervious surfaces associated with the construction of streets buildings sidewalks and paved driveways and parking lots c alteration of the groundwater regime that may adversely affect drainage systems slope stability and survival of existing andor newly established vegetation d creation of exposures facing south and west that may hinder plant growth due to adverse temperature and moisture conditions e exposure of subsurface materials that are rocky acidic droughty or otherwise unfavorable to the establishment of vegetation f adverse alteration of surface runoff patterns by construction
