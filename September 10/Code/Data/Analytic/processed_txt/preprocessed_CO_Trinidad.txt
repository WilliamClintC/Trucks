council city employees or city management members of subordinate city boards and commissions serve at the pleasure of city council and may be removed from their position for cause by a majority vote of city council rules of ethics 1 confidentiality it is of the utmost importance that board and commission members keep confidential matters confidential and hold inviolate information that is entrusted to them as part of their official duties while many matters will be entrusted to board and commission members with the expectation and belief that the commission member will keep the matter confidential there are certain matters that are and must be kept confidential under all circumstances such confidential information includes but is not limited to a executive sessions it is required that all matters imparted or discussed during an executive session be kept confidential this requirement applies to all participantsattendees of an executive session but especially so for the board and commission members present at the executive session everything that is discussed the viewpoints expressed or the leanings of individual members all must be kept confidential this is especially so for legal advice given during executive sessions in such matters the confidentiality considerations are heightened by attorneyclient principles as well as the requirements of the confidentiality of executive sessions the content of such executive session shall be kept confidential unless it is decided by a majority of city council to make the matter public board or commission members may lose insurance coverage for revealing matters that are discussed in executive session b legal advice given outside of executive session a member of a board or commission may receive legal advice in their capacity as a municipal official in several ways legal advice given publicly or during a meeting clearly does not carry with it the need for confidentiality nor can it be expected to be kept confidential a board or commission member must differentiate however between legal advice given previously in a confidential sessiondiscussion and what has been discussed or revealed publicly c quasijudicial matters matters shared with board or commission members during before or after a quasijudicial matter must absolutely remain confidential so as to not jeopardize the integrity of the decision making process d other confidential matters there will be other matters entrusted to board and commission members in their official capacities as well where the board member will be asked or expected to keep a matter or matters confidential usually the person imparting the confidential information will declare the information confidential before the discussion regarding the information but in some instances it should be a matter of common sense as to information that should be kept confidential 2 lawful compliance board or commission members shall be expected and required to be law abiding during their tenure in office law abiding shall mean free of criminal convictions consisting of felonies misdemeanors class one traffic offenses or criminal violations of the trinidad municipal code criminal convictions shall not be taken to mean convictions for traffic offenses lower than a class one traffic offense a conviction of a crime under state statute federal statute or the trinidad municipal other municipal codes may result in the recommendation of the resignation of a member of city council or a member of a subordinate board or commission a vote of no confidence by a majority vote of city council or the removal of a member of a subordinate board or commission by a majority vote of city council board or commission members must also abide by and adhere to the trinidad municipal charter and adhere to the requirements and legal standards set forth therein repeated violations of the trinidad municipal charter by an individual city council or board or commission member shall be treated as a violation of any other portion of the ethics or conduct if city council or a subordinate board or commission shall inadvertently violate the trinidad city charter it shall not be deemed a violation by any individual member or all of the council or a subordinate board or commission 3 conflicts of interest board and commission members have a fiduciary responsibility to their constituents and to the people that transact business and come before them to ensure that their decision making is independent unbiased and free from inappropriate outside influences stated conversely it is of paramount importance that board and commission members make decisions in the best interests of trinidad and not themselves their friends or family members conflicts of interest can and will arise for board and commission members in many ways it is vital to the decision making process that board and commission members exercise independent judgment free of conflicts of interest as always if a board or commission member believes he or she has a conflict of interest the best course of action is to err on the side of disclosure in revealing the potential or actual conflict and seek the advice of staff and the legal advice of the city attorney in such a situation the standard that shall be adopted for purposes of this that if there is a substantial appearance of impropriety the appearance of selfdealing or the likelihood of an impossibility or improbability of being able to exercise independent judgment as determined by a reasonable person standard that is would a reasonable person in the board or commission members position have their ability to fairly decide a matter compromised impaired by or would there be the appearance of impropriety with respect to an outside matter that would make it less likely to render an impartial decision based entirely on the matter presented to the board or commission member a a direct conflict of interest a direct conflict of interest shall involve or deal with any decision a board or commission member would be required to make that would affect said members business or financial interests  the business or financial interests of a competitor business  any matter that a board or commission member has a direct financial interest in  any matter that would similarly benefit a board or commission members family or family member or their financial interests a direct conflict of interest reflects directly on ones ability to fairly judge or consider a matter and shall always be disqualifying for a board or commission member b an indirect or potential conflict of interest there will be times when a board or commission member will have a conflict of interest that is not a direct conflict but could or would rise to the level of a conflict of interest nonetheless the appearance of impropriety standard would apply to such situations and if it does appear that the board or commission member would have their ability to exercise independent and impartial judgement reasonably questioned the member should move to recuse or disqualify him or herself if a board or commission member suspects that they may have a conflict of interest the member should not take any action with respect to the matter until the question of the conflict of interest can be resolved a board or commission member should raise or discuss the possibility of a conflict of interest as soon as they suspect that they may have a conflict also one should not attempt to influence ones fellow members of a board or commission or members of subordinate boards or commissions on any matter within which they may have a conflict of interest this is especially true of matters of a quasi judicial nature 4 communications board or commission members must not run afoul of the colorado open meetings law and discuss city business with more than one of their fellow board or commission members communications between three board or commission members or more without a meeting having been properly noticed is a violation of the colorado open meetings law a board or commission member shall not initiate encourage or participate in or continue a meeting that one knows or reasonably should have known is in violation of the colorado open meetings law this shall include communication by way of email or text messaging as a group email or group text to two or more members of a board or commission would constitute a meeting in contravention of the colorado open meetings law 5 nepotism a board or commission member shall not attempt to benefit a family member by obtaining employment for them having a city contract awarded to a family member or otherwise acting in ones official capacity to benefit promote or elevate a family member these rules should apply to a board or commission members close friends as well and again the appearance of impropriety standard should apply to this situation as well all rules with respect to conflicts of interest apply to matters of nepotism and it is a clear conflict andor misuse of office to try to benefit or advance a family member in ones capacity as a board or commission member nepotism rules and considerations should be applied and construed strictly to personnel matters and a board or commission member should not try to interfere with or influence city management regarding the hiringfiring of a family member or friend or if already part of the city work force their work performance disciplinary matters or any investigative or disciplinary matter undertaken by the city regarding that friend or family member 6 emolumentsgifts a board or commission member should not accept a gift with more than $5000 in value a board or commission member should never accept services in lieu of or as a gift if it relates to their being a board or commission member violations  sanctions if a violation of this ethics the conduct is proven the ethics board shall elect from the following options the punitive sanction to be imposed to issue a public warning verbal or written  to issue a public reprimand or censure verbal or written  to issue a written public admonishment  a public warning shall be the least severe form of punishment followed by a public reprimandcensure with the most severe form of punishment being a public admonishment as part of an adjudication of wrongdoing and the imposition of a punitive sanction being imposed per the above the board of ethics may also recommend or strongly encourage the respondent to attend remedial education or training given by an organization such as cirsa or the colorado municipal league regarding the issues that gave rise to the complaint in considering what punishment to impose the board of ethics shall consider the severity of the misconduct  whether the member has been the subject of an ethics proceeding before especially as it concerns the conduct complained of and whether the present proceeding is of the same subject matter as prior ethics complaintsproceedings  the facts giving rise to the complaint the mitigation or aggravation of the alleged misconduct and  whether the council or board or commission member is likely to repeat the conduct that gave rise to the complaint the ethics board does not have the authority to remove a member of city council but does have that authority with a member of a subordinate board or commission the ethics board shall not have the authority to levy a fine or impose other sanctions not specified by this 3 conduct this conduct is designed to set forth and memorialize tenants of good conduct for board and commission members in facilitating how such members deal with and interact with each other the public and staff in their municipal capacities this conduct should be used in conjunction with each individual board and commission members sense of decency respect kindness to others and desire to pursue excellence in municipal affairs by getting along with each other members of boards or commissions are better able to focus on the business at hand rather than focusing on individual personalities or issues with each other board and commission members shall a while serving a term as an elected or appointed member of a trinidad board or commission be mindful that you are always representing the city of trinidad even when not conducting official business b be respectful of everyone and everyones viewpoints including your peers on your particular board or commission treat them as you yourself would

authority while conducting the meeting  i remember that one of the most important reflections of a city and a citys reputation is how well meetings are conducted especially that of city council the better all of the constituent parts function the better members get along the more that gets accomplished in an efficient expeditious yet thorough manner the better the city looks to the outside world respecting each other the public and staff being prepared setting aside petty personal agendas and focusing on the business at hand are all the hallmarks of a city board or commission to be proud of and  j recognize the presiding officer as such and points of order and points of personal privilege notwithstanding respecting his or her authority while conducting the meeting one can always address a matter with the presiding officer after the meeting and express concerns or issues then the more a board or commission member maintains their composure and professionalism during something the individual board or commission member doesnt agree with the greater the likelihood of a rational result this conduct while setting forth standards of positive and favorable conduct are primarily

public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of trinidad colorado does ordain as follows 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of trinidad are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from damage also contribute to the flood loss 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions 4 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood
