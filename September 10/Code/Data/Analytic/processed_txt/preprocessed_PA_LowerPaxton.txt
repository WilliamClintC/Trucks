township and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits management provisions designed to a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpointsource pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment that may cause loss of natural infiltration or accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth of pennsylvania their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes stormwater program f implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program within ms4 permitted urbanized areas to

district in order to use  203311 the applicant must prove compliance with all of the requirements of this  203311 to the satisfaction of the township if an area of land is not within the osd overlay district then an applicant may request that the board of supervisors consider a zoning map amendment to add the osd overlay district to that land area an open space development shall be permitted by right within the osd overlay district 1 an open space development is a residential development that meets the requirements of this  203311 and is approved by the township as an open space development an open space development shall only be allowed in the osd overlay district 2 uses an open space development shall only include the following uses singlefamily detached dwellings nature preserves townshipowned recreation noncommercial recreation uses that the township approves to be within the preserved open space utilities necessary to serve the development and customary permitted accessory uses a mobilemanufactured home park shall not qualify as a open space development 3 a tract shall be eligible for approval for a open space development if it includes a minimum of 10 acres of lot area in common ownership in the osd overlay district such land area shall be contiguous except that portions of the tract may be separated only by existing or proposed streets or creeks a the amount of preserved open space shall be based upon the total lot area of all lots within the development prior to subdivision and prior to deletion of rightsofway of future streets and before deleting the area of any environmental  203311 general provisions  203311  features land area of future rightsofway of existing streets may be deleted from the total lot area before calculating the required amount of preserved open space  areas that were preserved by a conservation or agricultural preservation easement or deed restriction prior to the submittal of the subdivision plan shall not be counted towards the area of the tract in calculating preserved open space or allowed density b areas used for a principal nonresidential use other than uses approved by the township to be part of the preserved open space shall not be included within the land area used to calculate residential density c conservation easements or deed restrictions shall be established on lots as necessary to ensure that the maximum density requirement is met over time such conservation easements shall prevent the resubdivision of lots in a manner that would violate this  203311 4 an open space development shall be designed as a unified coordinated residential development and shall be approved with a single development plan proposed by a single development entity after final subdivision approval and within an approved development agreements and phasing plan portions of the development may be transferred to different entities provided that there is compliance with the approved development plan and this  203311 5 procedures a applicants are strongly encouraged to first submit a sketch plan before completing detailed fully engineered preliminary subdivision plans this twostep process will allow the township and the applicant to discuss the preserved open space and development layout before large sums of money are spent by the applicant on detailed engineering b the applicant and township officials are strongly encouraged to walk the tract after a detailed existing features map has been provided to the township but before the site layout has been finalized c density open space and lot standards the maximum number of dwelling units on the tract shall be determined based upon an existing features map and a yield plan except within the ar district 1 an existing features map shall be required to be submitted as part of the application for an open space development this existing features map shall accurately show the locations of the following at a minimum wetlands 100year

the maximum number of dwelling units that would be possible under current township ordinances if the open space development provisions would not be used and instead the provisions for conventional development in the applicable zoning district would be used the yield plan shall be completed to an accurate scale including accurately showing the existing feature map information described above the yield plan shall show potential lots streets and retentiondetention pond locations however the yield plan shall not serve as and is not required to contain the engineering detail requirements of a preliminary subdivision plan 3 the yield plan shall be reviewed by the zoning officer and township engineer and then determined by the planning commission as to whether it represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of dwelling units possible on the site both physically and legally if such estimates are determined to not be accurate the applicant shall be required by the zoning officer to revise the yield plan until it is accurate a for land that is not within the ar district the maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the tract space development shall be 10% greater than the number of dwelling units that is determined by the township to be possible under the townshipaccepted yield plan b the allowed number of dwelling units may be rounded to the nearest whole number c the yield plan shall not have any legal standing except for the purposes of determining density for an open space development 4 for land within the ar district the maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the tract space development shall be equal to an average of one dwelling unit for every 10 acre of total lot area 5 all provisions of the zoning district shall apply except for

preserved as preserved open space 6 utilities any lot of less than one acre shall be served by townshipapproved public sanitary sewerage service and public water service 7 subdivision of part of a tract this 7 addresses a situation in which only part of a lot is proposed to be subdivided and the applicant at the present time does not intend to subdivide for the maximum number of dwellings allowed by this section in such case the applicant shall establish a permanent conservation easement covering preserved open space to comply with this section because only part of the tract is being subdivided it may not be necessary to meet the preserved open space requirement based upon the area of the entire tract a the land under the conservation easement shall be a regular rectangle in shape and shall be located where it could adjoin land that would be added as preserved open space in the future if the total allowed number of dwellings would be developed b the following hypothetical example assumes a tract includes 50 acres and the yield plan determines that the applicant for an open space development is allowed a total of 30 new dwellings in this example the applicant only wishes to subdivide lots for 10 new dwellings at the present time which is 13 of the total number of allowed dwellings at the present time only 13 of the open space would need to be preserved compared to if all of the allowed housing units would be developed however the preserved open space would need to be placed on the tract at a location where it could be joined by  203311 lower paxton code  203311  the remaining acres of land under a conservation easement if the applicant in the future decided to subdivide lots for the remaining 20 dwelling units that are allowed 8 a minimum of 50% of the required preserved open space shall be in one contiguous lot except that the preserved open space may be separated by creeks lakes and a maximum of one street a the board of supervisors may approve the following if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors that such configuration would serve the purposes of this section and be in the best interests of the township considering the unique circumstances of the tract  a reduction of the percentage of the preserved open space that is in one lot  or  the crossing of the preserved open space by two or more streets b an accessway limited to emergency vehicles may also cross the preserved open space 9 the board of supervisors may require that the majority of the required preserved open space be placed a adjacent to an existing or planned public or homeowner associationowned recreation area  b adjacent to existing farmland  c at the edge of a neighboring undeveloped lot where the preserved open space could be connected in the future to open space on that neighboring lot  or d adjacent to an arterial street or expressway where the open space will serve to buffer homes from the traffic d conditions for approval an open space development shall only be approved if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors based upon review by the planning commission that the following additional conditions shall be met 1 that the open space development would clearly serve a valid public purpose that would result in a development that would be superior to what would result if the land would be developed as a conventional development such valid public purposes include but are not limited to the following a the permanent preservation of dense forests steep slopes wetlands creek valleys highly scenic areas or other sensitive natural features  203311 general provisions  203311  b the permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in agricultural uses in a tract of proper size and configuration that allows for efficient agricultural use and that properly considers the issue of compatibility between the agricultural uses and homes in such case new dwellings shall be clustered adjacent to existing dwellings and residential zoning districts c the dedication of recreation land at a site deemed appropriate by the board of supervisors and that involves land that is clearly suitable for active andor passive recreation d the provision of preserved open space in a location that will allow homes to be buffered from highlynoxious nuisancegenerating uses such as a

lowmaintenance landscaping is encouraged along creeks and other areas where maintenance would otherwise be difficult b the natural features of the site shall be a major factor in determining the siting of dwelling units and streets 3 the township may require the use of conservation easements within an open space development to limit the disturbance of natural slopes over 15% wetlands mature forests creek valleys and other important natural features e preserved open space 1 preserved open space the minimum amount of preserved open space shall be provided which shall meet the requirements of this chapter and the definition in  203202 of open space preserved a the preserved open space requirements of this  203311 shall be in addition to the recreation land or feeinlieu of land requirements of the township subdivision and land development saldo unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors that the proposed preserved open space would include suitably improved land that will meet the intent of the recreation land requirements of the saldo  203311 lower paxton code  203311  b the preserved open space requirements of this  203311 shall not be waived payment of a fee in lieu of land 2 open space standards required preserved open spaces shall meet all of the following requirements a preserved open space shall be permanently deedrestricted

the township shall only approve an open space development if the applicant proves there will be an acceptable method to ensure permanent ownership preservation and maintenance of land that will not be included in individual home lots a the method of ownership and use of any required preserved open space shall be determined prior to preliminary subdivision or land development approval the township should be given right of first refusal at the time of such review to accept proposed open space as public open space the township shall only accept ownership of open space if the board of supervisors has agreed in writing in advance to accept such ownership if the preserved open space will not be owned by the township then the preserved open space shall be permanently preserved by one or a combination of the following methods that are found to be acceptable to the board of supervisors  dedication to the county as public open space if the county commissioners agree in writing to such

lower paxton code  203313   203313 optional transfer of development rights tdr a purposes in addition to serving the overall purposes of this chapter this section is intended to 1 encourage the permanent preservation of important farmland and environmentally sensitive areas  2 direct growth to locations where public water and sewerage services are available  and 3 provide a voluntary method for landowners to be compensated by the free market to preserve their land b applicability 1 the transfer of development rights shall only officially occur at the time of final approval of a subdivision or land development plan or a conditional use approval the approval of a preliminary plan shall be conditioned upon compliance with this section as part of a preliminary and final plan application the applicant shall present a draft conservation easement on the sending property and a written signed and notarized agreement by the owner of the sending property acknowledging and agreeing to the application 2 the conservation easement shall be drafted so that it is binding if the receiving property is granted final subdivision or land development plan approval the conservation easement shall be recorded at the same time as or prior to the final plan for the receiving property a if a final plan is recorded in phases then the conservation easement may be recorded in corresponding phases 3 the form of the conservation easement shall be acceptable to the board of supervisors based upon review by the township solicitor and planning commission the term conservation easement shall include but not be limited to an agricultural conservation easement in the case of agricultural land the standard language for an agricultural conservation easement used by the county agricultural land preservation board may be utilized 4 a sending property shall be within the co ar or r1 district a sending property shall have a minimum lot area of 10 acres 5 a receiving property shall be within the r1 or r2 district 6 the owners of the sending and receiving properties shall voluntarily commit to participate in the transfer of development rights once such conservation easement is established it shall be binding upon all current and future owners of the sending property the applicant for the receiving property is responsible to negotiate with and pay compensation to the owner of the sending property  203313 general provisions  203313  for the conservation easement such transaction shall occur privately and the value shall be determined by the private market the township is under no obligation to pay the owner of the sending property unless the township purchases the development rights 7 donations or intermediaries the right to develop a sending property may be purchased by or donated to the township a township authority the county or an established incorporated nonprofit organization whose mission includes preservation of agricultural land or natural features a permanent conservation easement shall be established on the sending property at the time of such purchase or donation in such case the right to develop such dwelling units may be held for a maximum of 10 years before being used on a receiving propertyies c definitions receiving property  a lots that is approved to permit a higher density than would otherwise be permitted as a condition of the restriction of development on sending property sending property  a lots or portion of a lot that is restricted by a conservation easement or farmland preservation easement as a condition of approval of a higher density on the receiving property than would otherwise be permitted d determination of density 1 yield plans shall be presented by the applicant one yield plan shall be presented for the receiving property and one for the sending property such yield plans shall be a level of detail typically found in a sketch plan including showing potential lots and roads steep slopes 100year floodplains and suspected wetlands such yield plans shall estimate the number of new dwelling units that could be lawfully constructed on each property under township regulations without any transfer of development rights detailed septic perc tests are not required for such sketches but new septic systems shall not be assumed to be possible in areas with severe soil and slope limitations 2 such yield plans shall be reviewed by the zoning officer with advice by the township engineer to determine whether each represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of dwelling units possible on each site both physically and legally if such estimates are determined to not be accurate the applicant shall be required by the zoning officer to revise such yield plan until it is accurate 3 based upon the yield plans permission to develop the allowed number of dwelling units may be transferred from the sending property to the receiving property  203313 lower paxton code  203313 a for each dwelling unit that would have otherwise been allowed on the sending property one additional dwelling unit may be approved on the receiving property b if one or more lots each include less than one acre of lot area and are not served by townshipapproved central sewage service such lots shall not be used to transfer density c if for example the yield plan determines that 10 new dwelling units would be allowed under current zoning on the sending property and the sending property will be preserved by a conservation easement then the right to develop 10 additional dwelling units shall be transferred to the receiving property d the development of the receiving property shall still comply with all other requirements of this chapter except for the maximum density which shall be regulated by this section 4 a partial transfer of the allowed dwelling units shall also be allowed depending upon the amount of land affected by the permanent conservation easement a for example if under current zoning five dwelling units would be possible on the western portion of a lot and six dwelling units on the eastern portion the owner may choose to transfer the right to develop five dwelling units by placing a permanent conservation easement on the western portion the owner would then still have the right to develop the eastern portion under the zoning in effect at the time of a future development application for that eastern portion b if only a portion of a lot would be affected by the conservation easement the applicant shall prove that the conservation easement would permanently preserve a contiguous area of rectangular or similar regular shape that would relate to the number of dwelling units that would otherwise be allowed on such portion of the lot c where a conservation easement would be established in phases over time each phase shall be contiguous with a previous conservation easement unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors that there is a valid public purpose for the easement to not be contiguous 5 the receiving property shall be permitted to include the increased total number of dwelling units above the number that would otherwise be permitted as approved by the township based upon the yield plan 6 the development of the receiving property shall comply with all other requirements of this chapter except that the following  203313 general provisions  203313   203314 traditional neighborhood development tnd overlay district requirements shall be reduced provided the maximum overall density for the tdr is not exceeded a for a receiving property within the r1 district for singlefamily detached dwellings a minimum lot area of 12000 square feet and the minimum lot width shall be 90 feet shall apply provided both central sewage and central water services are provided b for a receiving property within the r2 district for a singlefamily detached dwelling the minimum lot area shall be reduced to 8000 square feet and the minimum lot width may be reduced to 60 feet c for a receiving property within the r2 district for other allowed dwelling types the minimum average lot area per dwelling unit shall be reduced to 6000 square feet 7 utilities to receive a transfer of development rights any lot that includes less than one acre per dwelling unit on the receiving property shall be served by townshipapproved central sanitary sewerage service and central water service 8 the transfer of development rights shall not be combined with reduced lot sizes and other incentives concerning open space development or traditional neighborhood development e once a conservation easement is established under a transfer of development rights it shall be permanent regardless of whether the receiving property is developed the approval to develop the receiving property in a higher density shall be treated in the same manner as any other final subdivision or land development approval the board of supervisors may extend time limits to complete the development of the receiving property in response to a written request 1 if an approved development on the receiving property is not completed the township may allow a new development application to be submitted to use such transferred number of dwelling units on the same area of land in such case the number of additional dwelling units that are allowed shall be added to the number of dwelling units that would be allowed under the township ordinances in effect at the time of the new development application a purposes traditional neighborhood development tnd is primarily intended to  203313 lower paxton code  203314  1 encourage new development to occur in a manner that will be consistent with the traditional patterns and scale of development and mix of uses that occurred in the region before 1946  2 promote a mix of diverse but compatible types of neighborhood development  3 avoid development that would be inconsistent with the character of the community and could cause inefficient patterns of sprawled development  4 encourage a blending of recreation areas preserved natural features compatible institutional uses and a mix of housing at a medium density including housing intended to be affordable to middleincome persons  5 provide for reasonably safe and convenient pedestrian bicycle and vehicle circulation with an emphasis on avoiding conflicts between vehicles backing out of garages across sidewalks  6 encourage persons to live work shop attend religious services and enjoy recreation within the township  7 encourage the creation of a sense of place feelings of belonging and a community spirit that promotes social interaction and volunteerism  8 encourage the location of principal nonresidential uses with distinguished architectural features at prominent locations around a central commons to serve as a focal point for the development  9 serve the purposes for traditional neighborhood development as listed in the state municipalities planning as amended  10 allow a tnd under this set of development standards to have a higher density and a wider range of uses than would otherwise be allowed in return for a higher level of site design and preservation of common open space land  and 11 promote the placement of new singlefamily detached dwellings abutting preexisting singlefamily detached dwellings on abutting lots when feasible b applicability the tnd overlay district is shown on the zoning map within the tnd overlay district in addition to development allowed under the conventional underlying zoning district an applicant shall also have an option of developing a tnd under the provisions of this  203314 a tnd shall be permitted by right within the tnd overlay district if an area of land is not within the tnd overlay district then an applicant may request that the board of supervisors consider a zoning map amendment to add the tnd overlay district to that land area  203314 general provisions  203314  1 if an applicant chooses to utilize these tnd provisions then all of the requirements of this  203314 shall apply all of the provisions of this chapter and other township regulations shall remain in full force except for provisions modified by this  203314 where  203314 and another zoning subdivision and land development apply to the same matter  203314 shall apply in place of that other provision 2 minimum tract size 80 acres however if one tnd has been approved to include a minimum 80 acres than an adjacent tract may have a minimum tract size of 20 acres provided that the second tnd is designed to be consistent with the first tnd including compatible architectural standards with the first tnd and a logical extension of streets the term tract size shall include the lot area of all lots prior to subdivision and land development but after deleting existing legal rightsofway of preexisting public streets 3 stub streets any tnd shall be designed with stub street rightofway extending to the edges of the tract if the township determines that there is potential for interconnected streets onto an adjacent tract the developer of the adjacent tract shall be responsible to fund the completion of the construction of such street extensions at the time they would be needed until such time the stub rightofway shall be maintained in vegetative ground cover any tnd shall be designed with streets that can be interconnected with adjacent lands to the maximum extent feasible and desirable in the determination of the township 4 master plan the tnd shall be developed following a single master plan consistent with final plan approvals individual portions of the tnd may be owned and constructed by different entities provided there is compliance with the overall master plan and the phasing plan c master plan for a tnd 1 before any use is approved or lot is subdivided for a tnd the applicant shall submit and have approved an overall master plan such master plan shall be submitted as part of or prior to a preliminary plan submission for a traditional neighborhood development such master plan should address coordinated vehicle access from all adjacent land owned equitably owned or otherwise controlled by the applicant if the applicants land extends into an adjacent municipality or zoning district then it is requested that the master plan also show such area to plan for a coordinated road and infrastructure system a the master plan shall be fully coordinated with any existing proposed or approved development on adjacent land including providing for pedestrian and bicycle access to adjacent tracts  203314 lower paxton code  203314  b landscaped open space and recreation areas shall be interspersed within the tnd pedestrian and motor

approximate lot lines and dimensions common open spaces recreation areas major pedestrian and bicycle pathways parking areas major detention basins and proposed types of housing and nonresidential uses the master plan shall designate certain areas for primarily commercial development certain areas as preserved open space and certain areas for various types and densities of residential development the intent is to have the higher density areas closer to the proposed commercial core and lower residential densities adjacent to preexisting singlefamily detached housing developments on adjacent lots 3 the master plan and application for the traditional neighborhood development shall be reviewed by the township planning commission and the board of supervisors after any modifications the master plan shall become part of the approved preliminary plan under the subdivision and land development preliminary plan approval is granted for the traditional neighborhood development then individual lots may be submitted for final plan approval under the subdivision and land development uses allowed by this section may occur as permitted by right uses a the master plan is not required to include the same level of engineering detail as a preliminary subdivision plan stormwater calculations construction details erosion and sedimentation control plans profiles and similar engineering details are not required at the master plan stage the master plan shall include sufficient information to accurately show existing conditions and the proposed layout of the homes nonresidential uses lots open space and streets 4 changes to the master plan may occur provided there is compliance with township ordinances the township may require that a revised preliminary subdivision or land development plan be submitted and approved if there are substantial changes from the previously approved preliminary plan 5 the master plan shall designate various areas of the tnd for various types or ranges of uses and types of housing the intent is to have most business uses and denser housing clustered at one area of the development the intent is to have lessdense housing towards the perimeter of the tnd particularly adjacent to preexisting singlefamily detached housing that is outside of the tnd  203314 general provisions  203314  d overall requirements a tnd shall meet all of the following requirements 1 the existing street system shall be extended into the new development to the maximum extent feasible streets shall be interconnected development the development shall have

to recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses that affect health safety and general welfare concerns of the township these secondary impacts have been documented in research conducted across the nation these secondary impacts typically include but are not limited to increases in criminal activity increases in activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases increases in activities that increase the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases increases in blight decreases in the stability of residential neighborhoods and decreases in property values for surrounding homes and decreases in the marketability of nearby commercial business space the research conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient selfregulation to control these secondary effects  to limit adult uses to locations where these secondary impacts can be minimized particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods

existing building for example an existing store might include three parking spaces and would have been required to provide seven spaces if it was newly developed therefore there is an existing

deficit of four equals six this provision may be used in combination with 2 below as applicable amended 11202007 by  2 if a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 5% in the

would be sufficient a the applicant shall provide evidence justifying the proposed reduced number of spaces such as studies of similar developments during their peak hours the applicant shall also provide relevant data such as numbers of employers peak expected number of customersvisitors and similar data b under this section an applicant may prove that a reduced number of parking spaces is justified because more than one principal use will share the same parking in such case the applicant shall prove that the parking has been designed to encourage shared use and that longterm agreements
