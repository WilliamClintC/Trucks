upon issuance of permits for the tenant improvements if at that time the determination reveals that the project will generate 120 peakhour trips the applicant will need to pay the impact fees for the 20 trips that were not prepaid and will need to pay the fees according to the fee schedule then in effect 2if an applicant opts to prepay in conjunction with an application for a tenant improvement

determination is done at the tenant improvement stage each 50 square feet of space shall be deemed to have paid for one peakhour trip so if the 500squarefoot space is determined to generate 20

impact fees b in the event the associated use or business ceases operation prior to end of the deferral period the property owner may request to the city in writing a suspension of impact fee assessments for that use upon receipt of this notice any outstanding impact fee amounts will be suspended until a new use occupies the space any amounts paid to the impact fee prior to this suspension will apply as a credit toward future uses 3 if an applicant elects to defer payment by either subsection e1 or e2 of this section the applicant will voluntarily allow a lien to be filed against the property prior to permit issuance the amount of the lien shall be equal to the deferred amount of the impact fee all costs associated with filing the lien shall be included in the applicants permit

live adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages and liquor eit is necessary to license entertainers in the live adult entertainment industry to prevent the

effectively classified by their function according to the character of the service they are intended to provide the functional classification system creates a hierarchy of classified streets the classification system can be used for planning new routes improvements to existing streets and planning for area development in concert with the transportation network and providing minimum design standards or criteria to encourage the use of the street as intended 2city definitions for each functional classification are presented below the city functional classification system directly addresses all streets that are under the jurisdiction of the city city streets are divided into major or principal arterials secondary arterials collector arterials neighborhood collector arterials and local access streets in accordance with regional transportation needs and the functional use each serves function is the controlling element for classification and shall govern rightsofway road width and road geometrics the function classification definitions in subsection b of this section are provided to assist the applicant in determining the classification of a particular street new streets will be classified by the director if a street or portion of a street is not listed the applicant is responsible for making inquiries to the director to determine the correct street classification bfunction classification definitions 1 major arterials amajor arterials provide service for major traffic movements within the city they serve major centers of activity intraarea travel between university place and other suburban centers between larger communities and between major trip generators major arterials serve the longest trips and carry the major portion of trips entering and leaving the overall area typically they are one of the highest traffic volume corridors in the city the design year adt is approximately 5000 to 30000 vehicles per day or more they frequently carry important intraurban and intercity bus routes bthe spacing of major arterials usually varies from about one mile in highly developed business areas to five miles or more in rural areas service to abutting land is subordinate to the provision of routes for major traffic movements it is desirable to place arterials on community and neighborhood boundaries or adjacent to but not major shopping centers parks and other homogeneous areas 2secondary arterials asecondary arterials interconnect with and augment the major arterial system secondary arterials connect major arterials to collector arterials and small generators they provide service to mediumsize trip generators such as less intensive commercial development high schools and some junior highgrade schools warehousing areas active parks and ball fields and other land uses with similar trip generation potential they distribute travel to smaller geographic areas and communities than those identified with the major arterial system they provide routes for trips of moderate length and somewhat lower level of travel mobility than major arterials the design year adt is approximately 2500 to 15000 bspacing of secondary arterials is usually less than one mile in fully developed areas they provide intracommunity continuity and are typically a continuous street with a direct rather than a meandering alignment they may carry local bus routes secondary arterials allow for more emphasis on land access than the major arterial system they usually do not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods 3collector arterials collector arterials distribute trips from major and secondary arterials to the ultimate destination or may collect traffic from local streets and channel it into the major and secondary arterial systems they carry a low proportion of traffic traveling entire subarea  they carry a high proportion of local traffic with an origin or destination within that area design year adt is approximately 2500 to 15000 they may be on a somewhat meandering alignment and need not be particularly long or continuous spacing is typically about onequarter mile in developed areas collector arterials provide both land access service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods commercial and industrial areas they may penetrate identifiable residential neighborhoods 4neighborhood collector arterials aneighborhood collector arterials distribute traffic between more principal traffic routes and local service streets within neighborhoods all of them serve as fire response routes some may be transit streets and some may be designated as bike routes because neighborhood collector arterials serve multiple purposes their use must strike a balance between efficiently moving traffic and preserving neighborhood livability bneighborhood collector arterials are found only in residential neighborhoods and provide a high degree of access to individual properties this classification is not applied to streets in commercial and industrial areas both rightofway and paving widths are typically narrower than on other arterials leftturn lanes are only infrequently used on neighborhood collector arterials and then only at intersections having higher volumes a great deal of flexibility exists for onstreet parking on this street type on most neighborhood collectors bicycles share the travel lane with other motor vehicles eliminating the need for striped bicycle lanes exceptions to this can occur in situations where traffic volumes or speeds roadway geometry or other factors suggest that striped lanes will provide a safer design design year adt is approximately 800 to 3000 5local street system athe local street system provides circulation and access for residential neighborhoods away from the arterial system the local street system consists of local feeder streets neighborhood streets access lanes private streets and alleys local streets should be designed for a relatively uniform low volume of traffic upon full development the system should be designed to discourage excessive vehicle speeds maximize pedestrian connectivity and safety and minimize the necessity for traffic control devices bfor developments or neighborhoods of moderate size or larger the streets serving as primary access to and from the bordering arterial system should be considered for collector arterial classification traffic generators such as schools or churches within residential areas should be considered within the local circulation pattern not only from within the subdivision but from adjacent neighborhoods as well there should be a limited number of access points with the arterial streets that border the subdivision clocal feeder streets serve as primary access to the development from the adjacent street system they distribute traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel it to the arterial system there are usually no bus routes with the possible exception of school bus routes they directly serve any major traffic generators within the neighborhood such as an elementary school or a church they usually serve one moderatesize neighborhood or a combination of a few small developments rather than interconnecting two or more larger neighborhoods they serve little if any generated outside the neighborhood typical adt may reach up to 1500 dneighborhood streets provide direct access from abutting land to the local street system there are usually no bus routes on neighborhood streets they are typically internal subdivision streets providing circulation within the subdivision or between subdivisions service to is deliberately discouraged culdesacs are prohibited on neighborhood streets in small lot developments and discouraged in other locations such culdesacs must include a central green court consistent with the citys low impact development goals and objectivestypical adt may reach up to 1000 eaccess lanes are designed to accommodate traffic between clusters of dwelling units most commonly within small lot developments they are the smallest street sections that serve emergency vehicles access lanes with a hammerhead central green court or auto courtyard are allowed in lieu of culdesacs which are prohibited fprivate streets are streets privately owned and maintained by the owners of the parcels accessing the street galleys are public or private streets providing access to the rear boundary of two or more residential properties that front a public street or a common open space area that fronts a public street alleys are not intended

design standards and guidelines for streetscape elements a general provisions  introduction streetscape design addresses elements that create pleasant desirable street scenes that define a communitys character the most easily identified streetscape features include street trees and other landscaping in sidewalk cut outs planter strips the narrow areas between the curb and sidewalk rightofway easements the often wider areas between the back of sidewalks and private property lines medians city gateways and entries into the city from major streets however neighborhood places such as plazas miniparks along city streets and trails where amenities such as street furniture benches trashcans etc or public art are located are also a part of the city streetscape less obvious streetscape features include bus stops and their associated amenities such as shelters benches and informational signs functional elements such as sound walls and planting associated with rightofway walls or fences as well as the irrigation systems and drainage systems used to maintain the streetscape areas are all considered a part of the streetscape streetscape improvements can have positive benefits to the natural environment the reduction of paved areas with landscape treatments can increase groundwater recharge as well as reduce the amounts of grease and oil transported to streams they can help slow surface runoff from storms and reduce soil erosion and sedimentation of streams select tree species can help create habitat and food for birds and animals improvements may also be designed to create special conditions to protect threatened plants that would not otherwise exist in an urban setting exh b 1  organization the design standards and guidelines for streetscape elements document is organized into the following articles ab streetscape design for vehicular zone bc streetscape design for pedestrian zone the vehicular zone includes the area of the public rightofway within the curbtocurb crosssection of the street that is occupied by travel lanes parking lanes and any medians traffic circles etc that occur between the curbs the pedestrian zone includes the outer portions of the rightofway that flank the street including sidewalks and any adjoining plazas and parks while the character and function of these two zones are closely connected the guidelines in this chapter have been organized by zone to facilitate their use the standards and guidelines in this chapter apply to neighborhood collector streets and local streets associated with new development within the city as well as qualifying modifications to existing development these streetscape concepts are intended to provide design professionals property owners residents staff and decisionmakers with a clear and common understanding of the citys expectations for the planning design and review of development proposals in university place if a conflict exists between these standards and guidelines and any streetscape designs adopted pursuant to a specific area plan the specific area plan standards and guidelines shall prevail the standards and guidelines in this section are also intended to supplement the street design standards and specifications in this chapter exh b 1  definitions bulbouts bulbouts extend the sidewalk or curb line out into the parking lane of a street to effectively reduce the street width these measures greatly improve pedestrian crossings by reducing the crossing distance and improving the ability for pedestrians and motorists to see each other curb extensions also can help reduce turning speeds at an intersection and provide additional space for curb ramps andor level sidewalk landings where space is limited bulbouts are only appropriate where onstreet parking exists  curb extensions should never reach into travel lanes bicycle lanes or shoulders design guidelines these minimum guidelines or recommendations are intended to guide the design of streets where conditions are not specifically addressed in the guidelines it is the responsibility of the proponent to show that the proposed design solution meets the intent of the most closely related guidelines median the area of raised paving or planting running down the center of a street separating the directions of traffic multimodal circulation refers to the circulation systems that involve multiple systems including pedestrians bicycles automobiles buses and other various forms of transportation found in university place multiuse paths an offroad hardsurfaced path that may be separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space or barrier which has been designated or designed and designated by the city for public use for humanpowered travel or movement paseos are private or public pathways that are designated for pedestrian use and where appropriate can serve as an outdoor space for outdoor dining public art retail space and other activities deemed suitable by the city pedestrian refuge pedestrian refuges are raised islands with minimum dimensions of four to six feet wide and eight to 12 feet long which are placed in the center of the roadway separating opposing lanes of traffic pedestrian refuge islands are particularly suitable for wide twoway streets with four or more lanes of moving traffic traveling at higher speeds they are particularly useful to persons with mobility disabilities very old or very young pedestrians who walk at slower speeds and persons who are in wheelchairs pedestrian scale the proportional relationship between an individual and his or her environment rightofway the boundary of public ownership of the street the area between private property lines is generally referred to as the public rightofway standards minimummaximum requirements based on quantifiable criteria streetscape the visual character of a street as determined by elements such as structures access greenery open space view etc the scene as may be observed along a public street composed of natural and manmade components including buildings paving planting street hardware and miscellaneous structures traffic calming refers to various design features and strategies intended to reduce vehicle traffic speeds and volumes on a particular roadway xeriscape a landscaping method that employs droughtresistant plants native to the region in an effort to conserve resources exh b 4 b streetscape design for vehicular zone  purpose adesign objective to create a circulation system that provides for the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and reduces conflict with pedestrians and bicyclists and to provide roadway standards that will help create streets that are inviting multimodal public places for vehicular traffic bicyclists and pedestrians bthe streetscape types and standards are intended to implement desirable and safe neighborhoods and to provide the pedestrian with a sense of safety and accessibility in university place cupmc  describes the characteristics of streetscape types allowed in residential neighborhoods in university place and upmc  provides standards for the streetscape types exh b 2  streetscape types the following streetscape types are specific to the applicable street types as defined below aneighborhood collector arterial neighborhood collector arterials are twolane streets that distribute traffic between principal traffic routes and local service streets within neighborhoods they are capable of a medium to high amount of vehicular traffic while still maintaining a high quality pedestrian environment wherever a neighborhood collector arterial intersects with another street the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with safe passage features may include pedestrian bulbouts differentiated accent paving or striped paint within the intersection and pedestrian refuge areas within the medians of arterials this streetscape type can be adapted to accommodate bus stops in accordance with city requirements and the specifications of pierce transit 1neighborhood collector arterial streets should be paved with a sixinch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter a fiveandonehalffoot to eightfoot planted buffer strip and fivefoot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street 2the pavement section width may vary depending on whether bicycle lanes or parallel parking are included 3culdesacs are prohibited 4the road rightofway should be a minimum of 60 feet in width the city may require additional rightofway width within the pavement section the buffer strip or beyond the sidewalk when determined necessary by the city engineer to accommodate parking traffic signage larger street trees or other facilities intended to serve the public 5a neighborhood collector arterial street shall be a public road figure 1 neighborhood collector arterial image blocal feeder street local feeder streets serve as primary access to residential developments from the adjacent street system they distribute traffic from neighborhood streets and access lanes and channel it to the arterial system these streets promote multimodal transportation and create a leisurely pedestrian environment within new and existing neighborhoods in university place landscape strips and parallel parking provide buffers between the pedestrian environment and vehicular traffic local feeder streets are intended to have a more intimate nature than higher level arterial and collector streets in the city wherever a local feeder street intersects with another street the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with a safe passage features may include pedestrian bulbouts and striped or differentiated accent paving within the intersection 1local feeder streets should be paved 34 feet wide from inside of curb to inside of curb with a sixinch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter an eightfoot planted buffer strip and fivefoot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street 2sevenfootwide parallel parking shall be included on both sides of the street 3culdesacs are prohibited 4the road rightofway should be 60 feet in width

or other facilities intended to serve the public 5a local feeder street shall be a public road figure 2 local feeder street image image figure 2a undesirable this street does not provide a safe or engaging environment for the pedestrian figure 2b desirable this street creates an environment that is better suited for the pedestrian creating a landscaped buffer and parallel parking buffer figure 3 local feeder street image cneighborhood street neighborhood streets are typically internal subdivision streets providing circulation within the subdivision or between subdivisions travel lanes and the overall road section are narrower than the typical local road contributing to the residential character of the streetscape 1neighborhood streets should be paved 27 feet wide from inside of curb to inside of curb with a sixinch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter an eightfoot planted buffer strip and fivefoot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street 2sevenfootwide parallel parking shall be included on one side of the street 3neighborhood streets should not exceed 150 feet in length without an emergency vehicle turnaround or to another road all portions of the exterior

locations a culdesac may be approved in a conventional plat when connectivity with the surrounding neighborhood is achieved such culdesacs must include a central green court consistent with the citys low impact development goals and objectives 5the road rightofway should be 53 feet in width the city may require additional rightofway width within either the buffer strip or beyond the sidewalk when determined necessary by the city engineer to accommodate traffic signage larger street trees or other facilities intended to serve the public 6a neighborhood street shall be a public road figure 4 neighborhood street image daccess lane access lanes are designed to accommodate traffic between clusters of dwelling units most commonly within small lot developments they are the smallest street sections that serve emergency vehicles access lanes with a central green court and auto courtyards are allowed in lieu of culdesacs which are prohibited 1the access lane should be paved 20 feet wide

rightofway on either side of the paved roadway 4an access lane should be a public road 5parallel parking should not be permitted within an access lanes constructed roadway the rightofway may accommodate perpendicular parking associated with private driveways 6an access lane should only intersect with another access lane neighborhood street or alleyway 7at the citys discretion pedestrian walkways may be constructed with pervious pavement in order to achieve low impact development goals and objectives figure 5 access lane image ealleys 1alleys are desirable facilities that eliminate the impact of the garage door and driveway apron on the streetscape and eliminate driveway access conflicts on streets with higher traffic volumes or speeds they enhance the pedestrian orientation of the streetscape reduce clutter associated with utility facilities and refuse collection and provide additional flexibility for emergency response providers 2the purpose is to promote alleys at appropriate locations with design quality consistent with existing neighborhood streetscapes and to improve the connectivity of future development in university place image figure 6 desirable front yard without garage or parking apron alleys are desirable to eliminate the impact of the garage door and driveway on the streetscape and eliminate access conflict to the street 3alley design principles aalleys may have a straight layout and an unobstructed view from one end to the other when the goal is to provide the easiest access for utilities and services and the most open invitation to pedestrian and vehicular traffic balley alignments may be adjusted to create more visual privacy use of jogs in the travel lane doglegs or neckdowns at entrances and building placement  provided that utility designs and emergency or service vehicle access are not rendered impractical cdeadend alleys should not be used except when there are no practical alternatives due to topography or other site constraints dwhen deadend alleys are used they should be less than 150 feet in length ean alley should be a private road emergency response vehicles must have access feach lot shall provide lighting from either an attached building light fixture or a pedestal lighting fixture that is directed downward or employs control features to avoid spillover into adjacent rear yards and homes gparking shall not be permitted on either side of the alleyway hwhere an alleyway intersects an adjacent rightofway the alleyway shall be designed as a residential driveway with continuous curb gutter and sidewalk along the neighborhood street or access lane ipervious pavement is encouraged and may be required in order to achieve the citys low impact development goals and objectives figure 7 alley

periods of the day and to emergency service vehicles in addition portions of the paseo may be used for outdoor dining retail space patios art gardens and related uses paseos should have a minimum unobstructed horizontal pedestrian clearance of 12 feet the total width of the paseo should take into account intended uses and furnishings such as tables benches planter pots etc and provide for 12 feet clear in addition to the space required for the desired uses and furnishings if a paseo provides more than one pedestrian passageway such as tables in the middle and pedestrian passage on each side then one pedestrian passage shall be at least 12 feet clear and any additional passageways must be a minimum of 10 feet clear these types of streets are not shown in current land use designations but would be appropriate to connect uses and activities in a pedestrian orientation without additional public rightsofway paseos can also be incorporated into development areas where unique site constraints or opportunities are present such as connecting front street and rear alley activity areas of the commercial block paseo street lighting and landscaping should be designed at a pedestrian scale image figure 9 desired this paseo provide ample landscaping benches and lampposts creating a preferable pedestrian environment figure 10 paseo image gmultiuse paths multiuse paths provide lowstress environments for bicycling and walking that are separate from motor vehicle traffic they can be great places for novice and child bicyclists to try out their bicycling skills prior to taking trips on urban streets multiuse paths are frequently in high demand among bicyclists joggers inline skaters people walking dogs people with disabilities and a variety of other users systems of multiuse paths in urban and suburban neighborhoods serve as the arterials of the bicycle and pedestrian transportation system they serve as a complement to and extension of onstreet facilities and offer the protection from motor vehicle traffic that many citizens seek when looking to leave their vehicle behind in favor of walking or using a bike or a skateboard or other form of nonmotorized transportation 1accessible path design because multiuse paths provide a transportation function all newly constructed shareduse paths should be built to provide access for people with disabilities in addition existing shareduse paths should be improved to enhance access whenever possible key issues for accessibility include trail access points grade crossslope street crossings curb ramp design railings and signage a single source of access guidance for shareduse trails has not been compiled  however taken together the sources above address the essential topics asurfaces can be paved asphalt or concrete or unpaved crushed stone or aggregate but should be firm stable and slipresistant bgrades should generally be less than five percent but can be up to eight percent for short distances such as 10 feet level landings or rest areas should be provided at appropriate intervals on grades steeper than five percent ccrossslopes for drainage or super elevated curves should be no greater than two percent 2trail width under some conditions the city may require a dedicated bicycle path and pedestrian path to be separated by a landscaping strip in such cases signage shall be provided to illustrate the dedicated bicycle and pedestrian lanes where space may be limited or bike and pedestrian traffic is moderate however a shared pathway may be acceptable the recommended paved width for shared twodirectional trails is 10 feet  however 12 to 14 feet widths are preferred where heavy traffic is expected figure 11 multiuse path image exh b 21  streetscape type standards the following

b 22  intersection improvements one of the objectives of the streetscape guidelines is to create a pedestrian friendly environment the following guidelines for the treatment of the intersection will help to integrate the future built form create a functional and aesthetic neighborhood pedestrian corridor and provide a safe environment apedestrian crossings should be striped with a painted crosswalk to provide high visibility for both motorists and pedestrians bcurb extensions or bulbouts should be provided at the four corners of the intersection as a means of reducing pedestrian travel distance across the intersection providing additional sidewalk space providing additional opportunities for streetscape treatments and to slow traffic cstreet trees and raised planters should be considered where they will not interfere with pedestrian movement or obstruct sightlines for both motorists and pedestrians dpedestrian crossings should be integrally designed with the rest of the intersection figure 1 intersection image exh b 23 c streetscape design for pedestrian zone  introduction adesign objective to provide a higher level of design detail and to promote walkability by improving pedestrian safety convenience and comfort the guidelines focus on improving the attractiveness and effectiveness of the pedestrian network in order to encourage walking as a realistic mode of transportation they provide design strategies for enhancing the physical safety comfort and convenience of the pedestrian environment as well as the aesthetic character and quality of the pedestrian experience bthis pedestrian zone article covers the following subcategories 1sidewalks  2curb return radii  3street widths  4street furniture  5bus shelters  6utilities  7medians  8planting strips exh b 3  sidewalks athe sidewalk is the unifying element that knits university place together from the citys core areas to the adjacent residential neighborhoods that surround it providing pedestrian linkages is vital to achieving character and a sense of community nicely designed sidewalks that are inviting are principal factors in creating and increasing pedestrian activity sidewalks can also aid in decreasing the amount of traffic throughout university place and providing safe routes for multiple users sidewalks can be designed to create a sense of community and social engagement bguidelines 1dedicate adequate space within the public street rightofway to support a safe comfortable attractive and robust pedestrian environment 2public sidewalks should provide a direct and continuous pedestrian network that connects neighborhoods to each other with a clear unobstructed pedestrian pathway that is designed to accommodate the needs of a broad range of users including the elderly those with disabilities and young children 3landscaping of the public sidewalk is encouraged as a means of adding color and visual interest softening the urban edges providing shade and improving air quality landscaping generally should be located in the amenity and frontage zones and should not obstruct traffic or access to the street exh b 31  curb return radii acurb returns are the curved connection of curbs formed by the intersection of two streets a curb returns purpose is to guide vehicles in turning corners and separate vehicular traffic from pedestrian areas at intersection corners the radius of the curve varies with longer radii used to facilitate the turning of large trucks and buses larger radius corners increase the length of pedestrian crosswalks special care must be taken in specifying curb return radii so that transportation facilities will be designed to be safe for all users regardless of the mode of travel they chose bgenerally intersections should be designed as compact as practical this is especially true for small lot developments which are intended to be pedestrianoriented in all facets of design while still accommodating the automobile to help achieve this goal the smallest practical curb return radii are used to shorten the length of the pedestrian crossing distance crossing time exposure to traffic encourage pedestrian travel and increase safety caccording to context sensitive solutions in designing major urban thoroughfares for walkable communities issued as a proposed recommended practice by the institute of transportation engineers ite in 200 a typical minimum curb return radius of 10 to 15 feet should be used where 1high pedestrian volumes are present or reasonably anticipated  2volumes of turning vehicles are low  3the width of the receiving intersection approach can accommodate a turning passenger vehicle without encroachment into the opposing lane  4passenger vehicles constitute the majority of turning vehicles  5bicycles and parking lanes create additional space to accommodate the effective turning radius of vehicles  6low turning speeds are required or desired  and 7occasional encroachment of a turning school bus moving van fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is acceptable dper the ite recommendations curb radii will need to be larger than 15 feet where 1occasional encroachment of a turning school bus moving van fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is not acceptable  2curb extensions are proposed or might be added in the future  and 3receiving street does not have parking or bicycle lanes and the receiving lane is less than 12 feet in width ein such cases where a minimum curb return radius larger than 15 feet is proposed it should be demonstrated that pedestrian safety will not be compromised beyond that which is necessary to accommodate other transportation facility requirements exh b 31  street widths apavement widths on many existing streets adversely affect the visual and neighborhood design character of the area being served wide streets are generally at odds with preserving the pedestrian scale and intimate character that contribute to successful residential neighborhoods bguidelines 1design elements are encouraged to be used to reduce perceived street widths these elements can include landscaping street tree placement medians and street furniture exh b 32  street furniture ain order to transform the public streetscape from mere transportation facility to vibrant public open space it is important to add facilities and amenities that allow people to stop and linger provide services and information and engage and delight the senses bproviding comfort and convenience for pedestrians is vital to creating vibrant and walkable neighborhoods the placement and selection of street furniture are keys to ensuring a comfortable environment for pedestrian and visual unity for all areas of university place street furnishings should be chosen in a manner to adapt to the context of the streetscape cguidelines 1street furniture shall be consistent with established city standards and requirements it should contribute to the character of development and should not impact adjacent development 2street furniture should be clustered to provide amenity nodes for pedestrians  however placement shall not obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic these clusters shall be provided adjacent to neighborhood streets where they may intersect pocket parks trails paseos or other offstreet amenities 3adequate space should be allocated to accommodate the various types of street furniture and anticipated volumes of users 4graffitiproof surfaces should be used where feasible exh b 33  bus shelters abus shelters shall be in keeping with the street furniture palette and shall be approved by the providing local transit agency bguidelines 1bus shelters should be provided at appropriate locations to facilitate transit use by providing places of refuge especially during periods of rain 2shelter design should also be compatible with the architectural design of the surrounding neighborhood 3transit shelters should be designed to provide protection from sun wind and rain  additional amenities such as realtime arrival information nighttime lighting and trash receptacles should be provided 4transit shelters should be designed to promote transit and energy efficiency by incorporating features such as solar panels led lights etc 5graffitiproof surfaces should be used where feasible exh b 34  utilities aabove ground utilities are a common element found within the context of the streetscape these utilities include power poles and lines transformers telecommunication pedestals traffic signal control panels etc often these utilities are located with little or no regard for the overall aesthetic appearance of the street while access and maintenance issues are important and not to be overlooked special design considerations must be taken into account in order to minimize their cumulative negative visual impact on the street bguidelines 1whenever possible utilities should be located underground where this is not possible utilities shall be located to the side or back of a building where they will be out of view from the street 2utilities shall be screened from view use of planting fencing or architectural screening the design of the screen or fence should be complementary to the building material and existing fences or screens if located elsewhere on the property image image figure 1 left utility box enhanced with landscaping above utility box hidden by landscaping  3ensure that maintenance personnel can access the utility without obstructing the movement of pedestrians or vehicles to other parts of the street or site 4the city should explore a combination of options to address the visibility and attractiveness of utility boxes 5landscaping shall not block impede or hide fire hydrants or fire sprinkler hose connections fire hydrants may be aesthetically enhanced provided their accessibility and use is not impeded or compromised exh b 35  medians amedians provide many functions for a streetscape properly landscaped medians can help to beautify roadways of the city while providing pedestrians a safe refuge during street crossings special considerations must be taken when designing and landscaping medians to take into account pedestrian crossings and intersection visibility landscape planting shall also take into account the widths and placement of trees to accommodate safe traffic flow on these corridors bguidelines 1landscaped medians should be implemented on arterial streets consistent with this title to create visual interest a more intimate roadway scale and a place for pedestrians to take refuge while crossing wide streets 2where medians are narrowed near intersections landscaping should be graduated and include the use of small accent trees and groundcover 3the use of groundcover or xeriscape concepts at intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape 4hardscape should only be used in medians where planting is not feasible due to sitespecific constraints such as narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor 5all landscaping requiring irrigation should be served by an automatic irrigation system consistent with city standard details and specifications in this title exh b 36  streetscape landscaping astreet trees and other landscaping treatments are essential for creating beauty and improving the quality of life in a neighborhood setting the benefits include providing shade and cooling effects providing a sense of enclosure providing definition and scale to the street protection from wind separation from vehicular traffic and reducing airborne dust and pollutants bmany opportunities exist for street tree planting and other landscaping treatments in the existing neighborhoods of university place the most favorable locations are within sidewalks and planting strips to enhance the streetscape environment and within traffic medians to reinforce traffic calming measures cguidelines existing trees within the public rightofway should be examined for growth characteristics the health of the tree and suitability of the location every effort should be made to protect mature and suitable trees considerations for the selection and location of street trees include 1the ultimate growth height and spread of the tree canopy in order to allow for unrestricted growth  2the density of the canopy ultimate shape and branching pattern trees will provide varying degrees of shade due to branching habits and size and type of leaf  3access to adequate sunlight and rain water considerations of other microclimatic limitations such as reflected light sources from surface pavements and buildings and increased wind load caused by building design should be considered when locating trees either on the street or as part of a site plan development  4the location of existing and proposed utilities to allow uninhibited growth without disturbance to the tree crown or root zone  5maintenance requirements of street trees including watering fertilizing pruning and repair of damage caused naturally and unnaturally  and 6height of the tree canopy to protect sightlines along the street for both motorists and pedestrians dstandards and guidelines 1planting strips planting strips aid in separating the pedestrian environment from the vehicular environment via street trees and other native plants and flowers in addition planting strips also aid in providing shade for pedestrians help to filter air from adjacent roadways and can facilitate a social streetscape environment landscaping of planting strips shall always take into account visibility at intersections and a safe passage for pedestrian movement aguidelines 1landscaping in planting strips shall be adequately maintained and include the installation of an automatic irrigation system consistent with city standard details and specifications in this title 2to provide a landscape separation between street and sidewalk planting strips should be installed between the back of the curb and the sidewalk 3planting strips shall be designed to the extent practicable to be wide enough to accommodate medium to large street trees that have a high broad branching canopy  a continuous streetscape planting strip exclusive of easements shall be located in areas adjacent to an existing or proposed public road the city shall decide on the width of the planting strip in order to balance median and sidewalk widths 4the planting strip shall be located generally parallel to the existing or proposed road and shall not be located in areas identified for road widening road projects drainage areas or other public improvement projects minor encroachments in the planting strip by drainage easements may be approved by the city 5street trees shall be required to be planted within the planting strip with an even linear spacing if minor shifts to the linear spacing are required due to the location of existing infrastructure development or required sight distance these shifts may be approved by the city 6the use of groundcover or xeriscaping concepts adjacent to intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape 7hardscape should only be used in areas where planting is not feasible due to sitespecific constraints such as a narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor 2street trees street trees are required on both sides of all newly created widened or substantially improved public and private streets to provide shade and to calm traffic aguidelines 1trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches within a development at time of planting unless the city determines that a particular species or cultivar which is available only in a smaller size is the preferred selection for a specific location 2spacing of street trees on average shall be 30 feet on center wider spacing may be approved for trees having exceptionally broad canopies and narrower spacing may be required for trees having narrow canopy forms 3street trees shall be highbranching with a canopy that starts at least six to eight feet above finished grade depending on species or cultivar and have roots that will not break up sidewalks or roadbeds or invade utility lines for areas without overhead power lines tree types shall be planted that will achieve a minimum height of 35 feet at maturity 4street trees shall be placed so as not to block sight distance or create a safety concern generally trees should be planted at least 10 feet from utility or light poles or fire hydrants 20 feet from street intersections and 10 feet from driveways and alleys the city may authorize irregular spacing to accommodate sight distance requirements for driveways or intersections or to avoid public infrastructure such as street lighting utility poles or fire hydrants 5street tree species shall be approved by the city in accordance with the approved street tree palette in table  the use of a variety of street trees within a development is encouraged to increase visual interest and minimize exposure to diseases that could target specific species and cause widespread damage if these species are heavily planted within an area the city may approve trees not on the approved street tree palette if a registered landscape architect or certified arborist demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the proposed tree species or cultivar will not cause damage to infrastructure or create nuisance conditions 6for access lanes street trees may be planted on the abutting private lot if the city determines that insufficient space exists within the public rightofway to accommodate the trees 3approved street

science they are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington 1the use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in table 4 where applicable to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses 2if an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in table 4 then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required for example a 75foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100foot buffer without them 3the standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion if the existing buffer is unvegetated sparsely vegetated or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided 4additional buffer widths are added to the standard buffer widths for example a category i wetland scoring nine points for habitat function would require a buffer of 225 feet

necessary to support the structures intended use to reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources multiple uses of the same overwater facility should be encouraged bnatural environment 1purpose the purpose of the natural environment is to protect those shoreline areas specifically associated with chambers creek that are relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions intolerant of human use these systems require that only very lowintensity uses be allowed in order to maintain the ecological functions and ecosystemwide processes consistent with the policies of the designation the city should include planning for restoration of degraded shorelines within this environment 2designation criteria the natural environment designation shall be assigned to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply athe shoreline is ecologically intact and therefore currently performing an important irreplaceable function or ecosystemwide process that would be damaged by human activity bthe shoreline is considered to represent ecosystems and geologic types that are of particular scientific and educational interest  or cthe shoreline is unable to support new development or uses without significant adverse impacts to ecological functions or risk to human safety 3management

purposes of navigation conducting commerce fishing recreation and similar uses and that this trust is not invalidated by private ownership of the underlying land the doctrine limits public and private use of tidelands and other shorelands to protect the publics right to use the waters of the state the public trust doctrine does not allow the public to trespass over privately owned uplands to access

design standards and guidelines for small lot and multifamily development are adopted by the city of university place to implement the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan specifically these guidelines implement the citys comprehensive plan land use policies relevant to urban design pedestrian circulation neighborhood and community identity housing choice and residential design the design standards and guidelines supplement upmc title 19 zoning regulations and will be used by the city to evaluate design review applications for qualifying small lot and multifamily projects comprehensive plan policies encourage a diversity of housing types that respond to market demand for a greater choice of housing options than is currently available in the community an objective is to accommodate housing at moderately higher densities in specific areas of the city than has traditionally been constructed in singlefamily neighborhoods the design standards and guidelines direct two such types of housing small lot and multifamily development to be built to high standards and achieve pedestrianoriented designs that encourage interaction among neighbors they also provide strategies to efficiently and effectively manage and protect the citys existing natural systems including water quality habitat and biological resources from the harmful effects of land development and stormwater runoff the guidelines and standards are intended to ensure that low impact development components are integrated into the designs of future small lot and multifamily development the goal is for this new housing to become a valued addition to the citys existing residential neighborhoods and enhance the communitys positive identity exh a 1  purpose and objectives the primary purpose of this document is to provide design professionals property owners residents staff and decisionmakers with a clear and common understanding of the citys expectations for the planning design and review of small lot and multifamily development proposals in university place the design standards and guidelines provide a framework to evaluate new development projects against the citys objective to ensure that these projects are well designed integrated compatibly into the neighborhood context and contribute to an enhanced community aesthetic these guidelines are intended to do the following aprovide a basis for making fair and consistent decisions in design review  bensure compatibility of new homes within existing neighborhoods  cprovide incentives for investment  denhance property values  and eserve as a design tool and reference document for residents designers property owners staff and decisionmakers exh a 1a  applicability and use types athe design standards and guidelines apply to small lot singlefamily and multifamily developments small lots typically are those less than 6000 square feet and small lot developments encourage diversity in the size of dwelling units by promoting and preserving smaller homes on smaller lots multifamily buildings are designed for occupancy by three or more families in three or more dwelling units and multifamily developments can be designed to accommodate rental or owneroccupied units the standards and guidelines apply to new small lot developments in r1 residential and r2 residential zones and new multifamily developments in multifamily low mfl and multifamily high mfh zones they will also apply to infill singlefamily dwellings on existing substandard lots of record and qualifying modifications to existing small lot and multifamily development provisions are organized by and based on development type rather than zoning designation bfor a complete listing of qualifying and exempt residential projects see upmc  cqualifying residential projects will be subject to administrative design review in accordance with upmc  to ensure conformance with the design standards and guidelines in some cases design provisions are mandated and in other cases there is more flexibility in how a project can meet a particular design objective generally the following rules apply to language used in articles iv and v of this chapter 1shall or must indicates a design standard and means that conformance is mandatory 2should or encouraged means the guideline is intended to be a recommendation about how to implement the goals of the design standards and guidelines dthe design standards and guidelines shall be used in conjunction with other documents adopted by the city that contain goals development parameters and more specific regulations relative to a particular type of development projects shall comply with applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan zoning code and other municipal code requirements when provisions included in the design standards and guidelines conflict with other requirements of this title these standards and guidelines shall apply unless otherwise provided exh a 1b  design review process one of the paramount goals of the citys comprehensive plan is to retain or create the qualities that comprise livable memorable and diverse community life zoning and other numerical standards and formulas are inadequate tools by themselves for building a livable community in that they cannot ensure quality of physical design design review is intended to be a complementary means of retaining enhancing or creating a sense of community physical structures administrative design review is a discretionary process established to determine the compliance of a development proposal with applicable design standards and guidelines the design review process ensures that there is a harmonious balance between the natural and built environments in a community it is also used to ensure quality development in accordance with the citys design objectives and to ensure that the appearance of development will be compatible and harmonious with the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties applicants should review this documents stated purpose and objectives design goals and concepts section and design standards and guidelines section to understand the rationale and spirit of the guidelines applicants should contact the city early in the project planning and design process to determine application and processing requirements and discuss key issues particular to a specific site exh a 1c  organization of the document the design standards and guidelines for small lot and multifamily development document is structured into the following articles aintroduction bdesign goals and concepts csmall lot and multifamily design standards dlandscape design standards and guidelines provides an introduction to overall design goals and design concepts includes specific standards and guidelines that meet the design goals and implement the neighborhood design concept is organized into separate sections for small lot residential development and multifamily development for each residential use

goals and concepts  purpose this article provides overall design goals and design concepts for the achievement of good urban design citywide specific goals for each development type are provided in followed by standards and guidelines to achieve the design goals the standards are intended to mandate necessary design components in small lot and multifamily projects that will help to create or preserve good urban fabric the guidelines are intended to encourage highquality building and site design while allowing flexibility for designers on a sitespecific basis exh a 2  overall design goals the design standards and guidelines have been created to help protect and improve the existing character of university places established residential neighborhoods overall design goals for small lot and multifamily developments are listed below apreserve and enhance the existing character of established residential neighborhoods by encouraging development that creates a strong community image and a harmonious appearance  bpromote new construction that respects and responds to the character of the surrounding built and natural environments and is compatible with existing and evolving residential neighborhoods site development patterns mass and scale and streetscape appearance  cencourage new small lot and multifamily developments that balance diversity of style with respect for the surrounding context  ddecrease the visual prominence of the automobile and related facilities such as streets driveways and parking areas in residential neighborhoods  eencourage greater variety in housing types housing choices site planning and density mixes in order to provide more diversity and visual interest in the citys residential development while preserving the citys predominantly singlefamily residential character  ffoster consideration of neighbors concerns regarding privacy scale massing and streetscape  gprovide design parameters for residential structures so that the projects are harmoniously integrated as they relate to the architecture in the vicinity in terms of colors and materials scale and building design designs should be sensitive to and compatible with historic and architecturally significant buildings in the vicinity and should enhance important community gateways and view corridors  hencourage development that contributes to the character of university place by establishing linkages to community focal points such as open space parks schools and civic buildings  istrengthen the pedestrian realm by encouraging landscaping and building elements such as enhanced paving materials accent lighting streetscape furniture and adequate sidewalk space which will contribute to pedestrian environments that are attractive and physically safe  jmaximize stormwater infiltration within developments and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site use of lid techniques  and kencourage new development that is urban environmentally sustainable and energy efficient in scale treatment and character exh a 2a  neighborhood design concepts university place is an established community with existing neighborhoods that have a rich and diverse history it is a primary objective of these guidelines to ensure that new small lot and multifamily developments are compatible with the adjacent homes and surrounding neighborhood information in this section is intended to explain the concept of neighborhood design awhat is a neighborhood neighborhoods are defined as a place with a character and a boundary they are the strategic building blocks of a community a neighborhood can be considered at two levels 1the immediate context or how the house or other residential structure relates to the adjacent houses and buildings see figure 1  and 2the neighborhood context or how the house or other residential structure relates to the visual character and scale of other houses and buildings in the general vicinity see figure 2 image figure 1 immediate context image figure 2 neighborhood context bwhat are the limits of a neighborhood for the purposes of these guidelines neighborhood is defined as the block in which the subject property is located and the area of influence around the residence for areas of the community that do not have an established block pattern the neighborhood may be considered an area framed by arterial or collector streets topographic or other natural features or typified by one or more common characteristics the nature of a neighborhood is often determined by the patterns shared between the houses and other structures that formed that neighborhood these patterns or characteristics include similarities in mass scale complexity of form topography relationship to the street and to each other see figure 3 image figure 3 immediate neighborhood of this house chow does a house or other residential structure contribute to the neighborhood character the scale and mass window and door patterns roof and architectural style of a building all make up the character of the building following are some of the common architectural elements that contribute to the character of an individual house and other residential structures and the neighborhood 1general height and mass of buildings in the neighborhood  2general location of buildings on the street and the way those buildings meet the street  porches walkways landscaping  3setback parking and garage patterns  4architectural style of a house or houses in a neighborhood  5arrangement of major building forms  6location of entries  7roof forms  8number of stories  9materials  10window type  11landscaping  12historic buildings or features  13topography the city recognizes and values the unique characteristics of its existing neighborhoods this section is not intended to dictate a single solution to every type of neighborhood development application rather these guidelines introduce good neighborhood design concepts and general provisions that can be applied to varying degrees within the distinct types of neighborhoods throughout the city exh a 2b  low impact development concepts low impact development lid is a more sustainable land development approach compared with conventional designs that begins with a site planning process that identifies critical natural resource areas for preservation lid mimics a sites predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate filter store evaporate and detain runoff close to its source development patterns based on conventional zoning codes often result in sprawl with its associated large impervious areas loss of natural resources and habitat increase in nonpoint source pollution and alteration of hydrologic systems conventional developments often start with clearing and leveling of the entire parcel construction of wide paved roads and overdesigned large parking lots typically follows these sprawling impervious areas eliminate vegetation and prevent water from infiltrating into the ground see figures 1 and 2 the result is the conveying of polluted runoff to water bodies in order to deal with stormwater that runs off these sites structural controls such as catch basins pipes and detention ponds are used instead of greenscapes conventional landscaping of these developments brings additional concerns including the introduction of nonnative plants use of herbicides pesticides and fertilizers and excessive water consumption the lid approach provides opportunities to build homes while conserving natural areas and drainage patterns lid is accomplished as a twostep process  first  thoughtful site planning and second  incorporation of natural stormwater best management practices bmps thoughtful site planning begins with the identification of critical site features such as wetlands habitat areas or drinking water protection areas that should be set aside as protected open space natural features such as vegetated buffers and view sheds will also play an integral role in any lid planning exercise after the critical open space areas are identified and set aside sustainable development areas are then identified as building envelopes image figure 1 large impervious surfaces eliminate vegetation and prevent water from infiltrating into the ground image figure 2 a clustered development with smaller setbacks and preserved natural areas left contrasts with a conventional subdivision where all the trees have been removed within the delineated building envelopes a broad range of design techniques or bmps such as shared driveways permeable pavers and bioretention are used to reduce the level of impervious cover and improve the quantity and quality of stormwater drainage other lid design techniques include green roofs roof rainwater collection systems rain gardens grassed swales stormwater infiltration systems and alternative landscaping through these techniques natural drainage pathways are conserved open space is preserved and the overall impact from development is significantly reduced often lid techniques provide benefits beyond those related to water and drainage for example green roofs also muffle noise by reducing reflective sound mitigate urban heat island effects by creating microclimates that cool and humidify air in their immediate area absorb dust and smog as well as nitrates and other aerosol contaminants from air and rainfall and generally provide natural habitat for wildlife including birds butterflies and insects lid techniques implement development practices that are sustainable and can result in multifunctionality lower construction costs environmental and social benefits reduced offsite costs more functional use of open space land better integration of the built environment with the natural environment reduced energy costs and increased property values design guidelines in articles iv and v related to lid are identified with a  symbol exh a 2c  design elements the design standards and guidelines in are organized into two housing type categories  small lot development and multifamily development and three design elements for each housing type this section explains the importance of each element in building stronger neighborhoods asite planning and design site planning and design standards and

nonresidential areas  3 encourage personal wireless service providers to colocate on new and existing tower sites  4 encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antennas to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on city residents is minimal  5 encourage personal wireless service providers to configure towers and antennas in a way that minimizes any significant adverse visual impact  and 6 provide for the wireless communications needs of governmental entities accordingly the city council finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary 1to manage the location of towers and antennas in the city  2to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers  3to minimize adverse visual impacts of towers design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  4to accommodate an increased need for towers to serve the wireless communications needs of city residents  5to promote and encourage colocation on existing and new towers as an option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future  6to consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent permitted by the telecommunications act of 1996  and 7to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties engineering practices and the proper siting of antenna support structures bnew uses all new antennas shall comply with this chapter after the date of passage cexisting uses all towers and antennas existing on the date of passage of this chapter shall be

have six months from the date of effective abandonment to colocate another service on the tower if another service provider is not added to the tower then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove the portion of the tower that exceeds the minimum height required to function satisfactorily notwithstanding the foregoing changes which are made to personal wireless facilities which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall not constitute abandonment however in the event that there is a physical reduction in height of substantially all of the providers towers in the city or surrounding area then all of the towers within the city shall similarly be reduced in height 3dismantle and remove facility if the tower antenna foundation and facility are not removed within the 60day time period or additional period of time allowed by the city the city may remove such tower antenna foundation and related facility at the providers expense if there are two
