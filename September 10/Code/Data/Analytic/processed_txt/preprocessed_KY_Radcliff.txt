vi appeals and variance procedures  7541 appeals and variance procedures a nature of variances 1 the variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2 it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b designation of variance and appeal board the city council shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of adjustments c duties of variance and appeal board 1 the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 2 any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal the decision to the local district court as provided in kentucky revised statutes d appealsvariance procedures in passing upon the applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  flood damage prevention 37 3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of the damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5 necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6 availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges e conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 38 radcliff  flood damage prevention 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration ma upon request 7 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions hereof are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  2 the construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land  and 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency flood damage prevention 39 g historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure h no impact certification within the floodway variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result passed 572007

201 findings declaration of public policy and purpose a the council finds it has been the experience of other communities as well as this one that certain adult entertainment activities which are located near areas zoned for residential use near schools and public parks and near malls and similar open spaces that cater to use by family groups and children adversely affect the viability of such nearby properties for their described purposes b local governments in the city of radcliff the commonwealth of kentucky and the united states government have spent millions of dollars on community development and neighborhood enhancement projects within the recent past to eliminate blight and to prevent the further deterioration of city neighborhoods c 1 the council relies on such evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment uses that is within the common knowledge of municipalities and is widely reported in judicial opinions media reports land use studies and crime impact reports made available to the council several of which are set forth herein additionally the council relies on repeated judicial findings validating municipalities reasonable reliance on this

also on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled stripclubs according to strippers exposing workplace sexual violence by kelly holsopple program director freedom and justice center for prostitution resources minneapolis minnesota based on cases and reports such as these the council finds a sexually oriented adult entertainment businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on property values urban blight pornographic litter and sexual assault and exploitation b sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex sometimes occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths rooms or cubicles for view films videos or live sexually explicit shows which acts constitute a public nuisance and pose a risk to public health spread of sexually transmitted diseases c adult entertainment businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other certain uses such as other sexually oriented businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration of sexually oriented businesses and such uses d each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the council has a substantial government interest in abating andor preventing in the future d adult entertainment activity tends to attract an undesirable clientele which discourages neighboring residents from undertaking civic improvements causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates attempts to attract new residences and businesses to come into an area all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general deterioration of neighborhoods e the small closetlike rooms or booths at adult amusement arcades in the city and other communities have encouraged persons to loiter for the purposes of engaging in unlawful often anonymous sexual conduct and have encouraged lewd conduct in public places thereby creating public nuisances and generally unsanitary and unhealthful conditions that create dangers to the public health welfare and safety 2015 s2 6 radcliff  adult entertainment activities f the concentration of sexually explicit movies and books and sexual paraphernalia in adult entertainment establishments which also house sexually explicit movies as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to couples afforded free sexually explicit movies in the hotel room have provided prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods g children the family environment and residential neighborhoods suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting from the distribution of and exposure to certain sexually explicit items and devices this is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to leave a businesss premises and litter the immediate family environment neighborhood and certain areas where children are likely to be h the noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult entertainment establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby residents and modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is offered to patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to persons living in those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the availability of adult entertainment i nationally there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own as well as the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other adult entertainment establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the enforcement of the federal racketeer influences and corrupt organizations act rico and the enforcement of the laws of the commonwealth of kentucky among others prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter the use of minors to distribute obscene matter the

sexual performance by a minor the promoting of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the advertising of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the use of minors to

deterioration of the neighborhoods of the city protect property values promote the return of residents and businesses to the neighborhoods protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material and decrease the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency the licensing and regulation of adult entertainment establishments is a public necessity and is required in the

thoroughfares including highways arterials and collectors serve as the primary network for moving people and goods these transportation corridors also provide access to businesses and homes and have served as the focus for commercial and residential development if access systems are not properly designed these thoroughfares will be unable to accommodate the access needs of development and retain their primary transportation function these standards balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of the citizens of radcliff to safe and efficient travel to achieve this policy purpose state and local thoroughfares have been categorized by function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance regulations have been applied to these thoroughfares for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents personal injury and property damage attributable to poorly designed access systems and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network this will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures these regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land protect community character and conserve natural resources by promoting welldesigned road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned subdivision of land 52 conformance
