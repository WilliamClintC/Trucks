normal upkeep and maintenance of nonconforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations that do not involve expansion of the nonconforming use or structure and such other changes in a nonconforming use or structure as federal state or local building and safety codes may require c nonconforming structures 1 expansions a nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with 1a and b below alternatively a municipality may by local ordinance regulate expansions of nonconforming structures in accordance with appendix a alternative to 30% expansion rule pursuant to 38 mrsa  439a in

the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a

board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation

the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to 1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with 2 above  22519 topsham code  22519  any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market

determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in 2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 4 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the

facilities and operations 2 contents of the chlorides management plan the cmp must address the following areas a how the project will be designed and constructed to minimize the need for the use of chlorides for snow and ice control the plan should address how the site layout and design minimizes the amount of impervious surface and how the need for snow and ice control treatments will be

the following criteria in reviewing site plan applications 1 mitigation measures have been utilized to screen antennas and towers from view from public rightsofway or scenic vistas either via landscaping fencing or other architectural screening 2 network interconnections from the communications site via land lines have been proposed rather than the use of microwave link dishes in order to minimize visual impact 3 creative measures have been employed to camouflage facilities by integrating them with existing buildings and among other uses  225603 topsham code  225603  4 other technically feasible sites have been investigated and if available the proposed facility has been relocated in order to minimize the effect of the location on visually sensitive areas such as residential communities historical areas and open space areas 5 collocation when technically feasible and visually desirable on an existing tower has been investigated and if technically and financially feasible the proposed facility is collocated 6 use of an existing community facility site such as on or adjacent to water tanks or utility poles has been investigated as a potential site for a tower antennas and other equipment and if available and technically feasible and visually desirable is proposed as the site for the facility i amendments any change to existing previously

15 a general any proposal for a planned mixeduse development must conform to the requirements of this section the approval of a planned mixeduse development involves a three phase process as follows 1 the site inventory and analysis phase involves the preparation and review of a detailed analysis of the existing conditions on the site the opportunities and constraints these conditions create for the use and development of the site and the factors that must be addressed in the development of the master plan for the planned mixeduse development this phase must be completed before the master plan is submitted to the town 2 the master plan phase involves the preparation and review of a conceptual master plan for the overall planned mixeduse  225606 unsecured loads  225607  development and the development standards that will apply to individual buildings subdivisions or phases of the development approval of the master plan and development standards must occur before any application is submitted for site plan review or subdivision approval 3 the site plan or subdivision review phase involves the preparation and review of the detailed development plans for individual buildings subdivisions or phases of the development in accordance with the towns site plan review requirements  andor subdivision of land requirements  in addition to conforming to the requirements of those chapters and the other zoning requirements a planned mixeduse development must demonstrate that it is consistent with the approved master plan and its development standards b where permitted planned mixeduse developments are permitted only in those zones where it is listed as a permitted use in  2251677 c uses allowed any use that is allowed as a permitted use or conditional use in the zone in which the development is located or that is listed as being allowed as part of a planned mixeduse development in that zone is permitted as part of a planned mixeduse development d area included the intention of these requirements is that a planned mixeduse development includes a substantial area that will allow for the master planning of a significant development activity a planned mixeduse development must include at least twentyfive 25 acres a planned mixeduse development may consist of a single large parcel or a number of parcels if a parcel with more than twentyfive acres is proposed as part of a planned mixeduse development all land that is in common ownership must be included in the planned mixeduse development unless specifically permitted by the planning board the planning board may permit land in common ownership to be treated as more than one planned mixeduse development if it finds that such treatment will be consistent with the provisions of this section and will result in a coordinated development approach for the entire holding if the planning board allows a planned mixeduse development that is less than the entire holding the development must include at least twentyfive 25 acres in this situation the site inventory and analysis phase and the conceptual site plan and preliminary infrastructure plan of the master plan phase submitted for the initial
