will be made during the preapplication conference in anticipation of a field inspection each tree shall be assigned a number on the plan and physically tagged in the field as described in section ive of this resolution appendix e tagging in the process of preparing oak tree reports each tree is required to be numbered in order to standardize the system so that everyone may easily locate the tree number the following procedure is hereby established 1 a permanent tag a minimum of one and onequarter 114 inches to two 2 inches is to be used for this purpose the tag must be made from a noncorrosive allweather material and be permanently attached to the tree 2 the tag shall be affixed to the north side of the tree at a height of three and onehalf 312 feet above the natural elevation

in signs of dieback disease and pest infestation and appears to be in an advanced state of decline 35 f   dead this tree exhibits no signs of life whatsoever v  standards for performance of required work a general information 1 scope of work all work shall be performed as specified in the approved oak tree report oak tree permit and the requirements contained in this resolution and the accompanying standards and details additional work such as spraying watering fertilization cabling bracing etc may be required as determined by the citys oak tree consultant it must be remembered that these trees are living organisms and that the necessity for such additional work may be required due to a change in their condition since the original oak tree report was prepared 2 oak tree preservation consultants generally the services of an oak tree consultant are made necessary by conditions of various permits issued by the city of agoura hills the importance of the consultant to the developerproperty owner is clear from the various requirements listed in this resolution from the citys perspective it is both necessary and critical that the developerproperty owner identify the consultants of record and allow them to act independently to perform their duties in a manner whereby they will be able to certify work as required by this resolution consequently except in cases where major cuts have been approved the developerland owner must not fail to provide their consultants with a fortyeighthour advance written notice before commencing any authorized work within the protected zone of oak trees moreover it is mandatory that the developerland owner notify the department of planning and community development in writing within five 5 days of any changes of their oak tree preservation consultants of record 3 inspections all work shall be conducted in accordance with applicable ordinances and procedures detailed in this resolution it is the developers responsibility to call for and secure all inspections required to approve all such work 4 work within the protected zone because of the high sensitivity of oak trees great care must be taken when work is being conducted within the protected zone for this reason the city has established specific procedures to ensure that the trees receive maximum protection the procedures are as follows 41 fortyeighthour notice except for deadwooding the applicant shall provide a fortyeighthour written notice to the department of planning and community development and his oak tree consultant before beginning any work within the protected zone 42 onsite supervision except for deadwooding all work conducted within the protected zone of the oak tree shall be performed in the presence of the applicants oak tree consultant and verified by the citys oak tree consultant 43 hand tools unless otherwise approved all work conducted within the protected zone shall be accomplished using hand tools only 44 certification letter certification letters are required for all work conducted upon oak trees in this regard the developers oak tree consultant shall submit a certification letter to the department of planning and community development within five 5 working days of completion of such work certifying that all of the work was conducted in accordance with the appropriate permits and the requirements of this resolution 5 new plants within the protected zone although any planting within the protected zone is discouraged only drought tolerant plantings will be permitted moreover if such plants are allowed no spraytype irrigation systems will be permitted each request to plant within the protected zone of an oak tree will be judged on its own merits paramount in the consideration of a request will be the compatibility of the plantings to the intent to preserve the oak plants should be selected from those normally found beneath an oak tree in its natural setting use caution to avoid plants which are susceptible to either phytophthora cinnamomi avacado root rot or armillaria mella oak root fungus b tree maintenance and pruning operations 1 ornamental or aesthetic pruning it is the policy of the city of agoura hills not to allow the removal of live tissue for the purpose of altering the appearance of an oak tree therefore ornamental pruning thinning out heading up or any other similar pruning which involves the removal of live tissue is not permitted 2 deadwooding generally speaking deadwooding an oak tree is selfexplanatory in that no live tissue is allowed to be removed 3 structurally unsafe limbs and branches live limbs or branches that do not exceed three 3 inches in diameter and are considered to be unsafe because of decay rot cavities cracks or splitting can be removed without obtaining an oak tree permit however the decision to remove such limbs must be made by the developers oak tree consultant any remedial actions on limbs larger than three 3 inches in diameter will be subject to city approval such request shall include a brief report from the developers oak tree consultant detailing the conditions that exist and any remedial work recommended to correct the situation 4 unbalanced trees trees that are suspected of being unbalanced because of broken limbs or which may become unbalanced as a result of the deadwooding process will require an oak tree report and an oak tree permit before any work can be performed the report shall contain an analysis of the problem and a recommendation for whatever remedial work may be necessary to correct the situation 5 pruning live tissue encroachments generally the removal of live growth must be approved by the department of planning and community development oak tree permit application a property owner may remove live tissue without obtaining an oak tree permit only when 1 the branches do not exceed two 2 inches in diameter and 2 the branches interfere with an existing structure no oak tree may be topped even if cuts are limited to branches less than two 2 inches in diameter in cases where new structures are proposed for construction no branch regardless of size can be removed without obtaining an oak tree permit no live tissue roots or branches exceeding two 2 inches in diameter can be removed without first obtaining an oak tree permit except where clearance is required for public utilities or public rightsofway after notice to the city for the purposes of this section topping shall mean the cutting of the branches of a tree in a manner which will substantially reduce the overall size of the tree canopy so as to destroy its natural shape all pruning work shall follow proper arboricultural practices as approved by the citys oak tree consultant where root damage has occurred the developers consultant may recommend compensatory pruning of the canopy to reinstate the proper rootleaf equilibrium all diseased dead or improperly pruned limbs shall be removed from each tree all root cuts two 2 inches and larger in diameter must be sealed with an approved pruning compound 6 fire damaged trees although fire is considered a serious threat to oak trees many trees can survive several damaging fires and live one hundred 100 to two hundred 200 years or more during this time they can continue to provide wildlife enhancement watershed protection recreation and aesthetic value to the community some trees may begin to exhibit visible signs of rejuvenation within a few weeks of a fire in its publication five southern california oaks identification and postfire management the uscda general technical report psw71 states that it is desirable to postpone the cutting of heavily charred coast live oak trees for at least two 2 to three 3 years on the chance that most trees will recuperate since there are many factors that will determine the survival of fire damaged trees a careful assessment of each individual tree must be undertaken before deciding on a specific course of action policy therefore it shall be the policy of the city of agoura hills to require a complete oak tree report on any and all oak trees that have been firedamaged before any work can be permitted this policy also applies to deadwooding in preparing this report oak tree consultants may assess the extent of the damage using visual chemical or electrical techniques as necessary recommendations to remove a tree or to perform remedial work may follow the general guidelines contained in the following publications a us department of agriculture general technical report psw71 b response of oaks to fire  prepared by tim r plumb and presented at the symposium on ecology management and utilization of california oaks june 2628 1979 if the removal of any live tissue is so indicated an exception may be made to prune the tree in such a manner so as to permit the regeneration process to proceed unhindered by dead or unhealthy limbs when cases such as these occur the developers oak tree preservation consultant will recommend a program in the oak tree report to address the problem 7 diseased trees  pests and insects generally speaking our native oak trees are a hardy species however there are a variety of diseases and pests that can severely affect trees that are in a state of general decline since the entire subject of diseases pests and insects in a highly technical matter no diseased tissue may be removed unless it is unsafe without submitting an oak tree report and obtaining an oak tree permit 8 roots all roots one 1 inch or larger shall be treated as in subsection 5 pruning where structural footings are required and roots will be impacted the footings shall be bridged and the roots protected cover all such roots with a layer of plastic cloth and two 2 to four 4 inches of styrofoam matting prior to pouring the footing standard details are shown in exhibit e1 2 and 3 finally all trees that have suffered root damage shall be fed nutrients to encourage new growth the developers oak tree consultant shall make recommendations to the city before proceeding with a nutrient feeding program 9 cavities all cavities must be cleaned out of loose debris some cavities must be cleaned out to remove all decayed wood while protecting live tissue from injury provide food proper drainage and allow for new growth as determined by the citys oak tree consultant concrete or other similar materials shall not be used to seal or fill cavities screening shall be applied over remaining cavities to prevent debris buildup 10 tree removals unless otherwise expressly approved in writing authorized removal of oak trees shall be accomplished using the following guidelines 101 all portions of the tree shall be completely removed from the site and debris relocated to a recognized county refuse disposal site additionally the stump must be completely removed and the hole or indentation filled with soil 102 all tree wells that were created to preserve the tree shall be completely filled with soil to the satisfaction of the city engineer and building official 103 replacement trees shall be planted in accordance with the procedures established in section v5 of this resolution appendix 104 unless waived by the department of planning and community development a refundable security deposit in an amount equal to the cost of the replacement trees shall be deposited in trust with the city of agoura hills to guarantee the implementation of section 103 the deposit will be refunded upon satisfactory completion of these conditions 105 a signed acceptance of the conditions of the oak tree permit for removal shall be executed by the applicant or his representative and the refundable security deposit shall be made prior to the issuance of the oak tree permit c phases of construction the information contained in this section is divided into the four 4 phases normally associated with new construction apart from the normal activities conducted during each phase there are certain conditions associated with work around oak trees that are required to be completed during these phases this section addresses these conditions and unless waived by the department of planning and community development are expected to be completed for all residential commercial and industrial projects 1 preconstruction phase this period is defined as the time between the approval of a development permit and the issuance of a stage grading or final grading permit no work of any kind may occur on an approved project unless a state grading permit grading permit or oak tree permit

plan should be designed along the following guidelines 1 a minimum fivefoot high new chain link fence in concrete footing will be required to be installed at the outermost edge of the protected zone of each oak tree or groups of trees exceptions to this policy may occur in cases where oak trees are located on slopes that will not be grubbed or graded or are located on future phases where there is no activity planned or no currently approved grading plan the fences must be installed in accordance with the approved fencing plan prior to the commencement of any grading operations the developers superintendent will be responsible to call the department of planning and community development for an inspection and approval of the fencing prior to the beginning of grubbing or grading operations 2 additionally signs must be installed on the fence in four 4 locations equidistant around each tree the size of each sign must be a minimum of two 2 feet by two 2 feet square and must contain the following language warning this fence shall not be removed or relocated without written authorization from the city of agoura hills department of planning and community development on a grove of oak trees signs shall be placed at approximately fiftyfoot intervals around the grove 3 once approval has been obtained the fences shall remain in place throughout the entire construction period and may not be removed without obtaining written authorization from the department of planning and community development b see required tagging per section ive of this resolution appendix 2 grading operations phase this period is defined as the time between the commencement of grading operations and the commencement of construction of the building improvements it is understood that the construction phase may begin while grading operations are continuing and that grading may begin on a subsequent phase while construction is still in progress on a previous phase for purposes of this section each phase is considered separate and the conditions associated with each phase will be required to be completed at the start or during the operations of each phase the inspector from the department of planning and community development will make that determination in the field in addition to the normal grading operations conducted during this phase the developer will be required to complete or satisfy the following tasks 21 onsite documentation the following information must be located and permanently retained on the construction site at the start of grading operations the superintendent will be

where it is not possible to avoid some encroachment the design shall minimize the extent of such encroachment and a report of these encroachments and mitigation measures will be made in a supplemental oak tree report 26 parking lots and pedestrian walkway improvement location since the citys policy is to preserve all healthy oak trees unless justifying the removal cutting or relocation of an oak tree architects should design their projects with this requirement in mind therefore for public safety reasons parking lots and pedestrian walkways must be designed so that no unhealthy oak trees are proposed to remain in high vehicular and pedestrian areas trees whose ratings are confirmed to be a d or less should be avoided in predesign or proposed for removal unless it is felt that major surgery coupled with a nutrient feeding program will restore the tree to a safe and vigorous condition to the extent possible parking spaces should not be located directly under the canopy of oak trees when this is not possible pervious paving material shall be employed to the satisfaction of the director of planning and community development the developers licensed engineer will be required

before the improvements are installed f all root pruning shall consist of clean cuts at a fortyfivedegree angle with the cut surface facing downward 32 fine grading permit oak tree lots only on most tracts the drainage patterns for the lots will have been designed into the original grading plan however this is not the case with custom lots and custom lot tracts therefore in an effort to avoid establishing drainage patterns that intrude into the protected zone of oak trees the following procedures have been established a custom lots and custom lot tracts a fine grading permit will need to be obtained from the city engineer before any fine grading work may begin the landscape architect or engineer shall design a pattern that will completely avoid the protected zone utilizing surface andor subsurface drainage devices additionally the oak tree consultant will be required to submit a supplemental oak tree report to the department of planning and community development for review and approval prior to fine grading the lot following approval of the plan and the completion of the work the oak tree consultant will submit a letter of certification to the department of planning and

tree that was approved for removal as follows a two 2 twentyfourinch box specimens and b one 1 thirtysixor sixtyinch box specimen as follows in the case of landmark trees trees whose diameter exceeds fortyeight 48 inches the applicant will be required to obtain a nurserygrown oak tree of equivalent caliper to the tree removed or provide two 2 container grown sixtyinch box oak trees for each healthy landmark tree approved for removal the purpose of this limitation is to avoid the introduction of oak root fungus and avaca root rot into this region 22 residential properties the replacement policy for new construction in residential properties is the same as described above in 21 however in cases where houses currently exist the requirement for replacement shall be one 1 thirtysixinch box oak tree for every healthy oak tree approved for removal in cases of landmark trees fortyeight inches or more in diameter a sixtyinch box oak tree shall be required to be planted 3 relocations in

approved for relocation will be considered by the city as removals 32 the trees being recommended for relocation must be approved by the citys oak tree consultant whose decision will be based upon factors relating to health type size time of year and proposed location 33 the diameter of any relocated tree may not exceed six 6 inches in diameter exceptions to this policy may be made if a larger diameter nursery grown oak tree is available and can be reserved for a period of one 1 year in the event the relocated tree does not survive for one 1 year 34 a refundable cash security deposit in an amount equal to the cost of purchasing an equivalent nursery grown oak tree shall be made with the department of planning and community development the deposit will be refunded after twelve 12 months if in the opinion of the citys oak tree consultant the relocated tree has survived and is considered to be in good health if the tree is considered to be marginal the deposit will be retained for an additional twelve 12 months when another inspection will be conducted if the health of the tree is unchanged or has declined the developer will remove the relocated tree and replace it with an equivalent nursery grown oak tree the security deposit shall be retained for at least an additional twelve 12 months 35 trees of replaceable size may be considered for removal so that the new nursery tree can be planted on site in a more appropriate location relative to the new construction 4 replacement treetypes sizes 41 types in all cases replacement trees will be as follows quercus agrifolia live oak quercus lobata valley oak other oak tree varieties must be approved in advance by the citys oak tree consultant note in some cases where it is not possible to obtain nursery grown trees in the sizes required an equivalent number of large and small container oak trees shall be planted in an amount equal to the cost of the larger but unavailable trees 42 sizes while it is recognized that tree sizes may vary somewhat the following table taken from the keelinewilcox 1985 wholesale catalog will serve as the basis for what the city expects in terms of sizes consultants will be expected to make every attempt to obtain oak trees whose specifications most nearly approach the following _______ size container height feet spread feet caliper inches 15 gal 24 box 8 to 10 5 to 6 2 to 212 30
