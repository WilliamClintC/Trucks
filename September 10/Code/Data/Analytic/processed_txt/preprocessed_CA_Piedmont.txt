and tangible benefits for both residents and visitors to the city trees contribute to the natural environment of the city by modifying temperatures and winds replenishing oxygen to the atmosphere and water to the soil controlling soil erosion and providing wildlife habitat trees contribute to the visual environment of the city by providing scale color silhouette and mass and by creating visual screens and buffers to separate land uses and promote individual privacy trees contribute to the economic environment of the city by stabilizing property values and reducing the need for surface drainage systems trees contribute to the cultural environment of the city by becoming living landmarks of the citys history and providing a critical element of nature in the midst of urban congestion
