are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity of lot size or shape or exceptional topographic or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unreasonable or undue hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions applicable to the stormwater management district in which the property is located b that because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformance with the stormwater management provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property c that such unreasonable or undue hardship has not been created by the applicant d that the waiver if authorized will represent the minimum waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulations as set forth 3 in granting

stony creeksaw mill run act 167 stormwater management plan developed by the montgomery county planning commission with input from the montgomery county municipalities and adopted by the montgomery county commissioners dated  hereinafter the stony creek plan the township is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the designated watersheds for the stony creeksaw mill run watershed release rate map developed and adopted by the montgomery county planning commission dated october 1991 hereinafter the release rate map the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which along with the stony creek plan and the release rate map is incorporated herein by reference and all of which are available for inspection at the township administrative offices  16621 east norriton code  16622   16623 stormwater management district implementation provisions 2 three broad categories of stormwater management districts namely the release rate district the provisional nodetention district and the onehundredpercent release rate district shall be applied in the township b categories of districts the stormwater management districts are hereinafter divided into three groups or categories as follows 1 release rate district within a given district the postdevelopment peak rate of stormwater runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak rate of stormwater runoff in order to protect downstream watershed areas there are numerous release rate districts which differ in the extent to which postdevelopment stormwater runoff must be controlled the release rates range from 50% to 100% and a specific release rate for each district is shown on the release rate map and the stony creek plan 2 provisional nodetention district these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak stormwater runoff without detention without adversely affecting the total watershed peak flow in certain instances however the local conveyance facilities which transport stormwater runoff from the site to the main channel may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with no detention for a proposed development in those instances the developer shall either use a onehundredpercent release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows in determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per the existing current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified within this chapter 3 onehundredpercent release rate district this is an area that should use a onehundredpercent release rate control to protect the areas downstream of the development site a onehundredpercent release rate control would result in the postdevelopment peak rate stormwater runoff being controlled to the predevelopment level as further defined in this chapter a compliance with release rate criteria any stormwater management controls required by this chapter and subject to release rate criteria 50% to 100% shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two five ten twentyfive fifty and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology set forth in this chapter  16622 shopping carts  16623  b boundary criteria the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development within the township shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using a twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the stormwater management plan the district boundaries as originally drawn on the stony creek plan coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction road culvert bridge etc to the topographic divide consistent with topography c downstream capacity analysis criteria any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting peak flow rates 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual latest edition 2 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff peak within their banks or to otherwise not create any hazards to persons or property 3 culverts bridges or storm sewers or any other facilities that must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must have sufficient capacity to pass or convey the increased flows associated with the twentyfiveyear return period event except for facilities located within a designated floodplain area that must be capable of passing or conveying the onehundredyear return period runoff any facilities that constitute stream enclosures per deps regulations shall be designed to convey the onehundredyear return period runoff d single release rate criteria for a proposed development site located within a single release rate category area the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple points of concentrated runoff discharge individual drainage points may be designed for up to a onehundredpercent release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate e two or more release rate criteria for a proposed development site located within two or more release rate category areas the total runoff that may be discharged at any point is limited to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff at that point multiplied by the applicable release rate the control rates shall apply regardless of any grading  16623 east norriton code  16623  modifications that may change the drainage area that discharges to a given point f locations of mixed categories for proposed development sites located partially within a release rate category area and partially within a provisional nodetention area in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate be drained to the discharge points located in the nodetention area g noharm option for any proposed development site not located in a provisional nodetention district the developer has the option of using a lessrestrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm must be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the stony creek or saw mill run with the schuylkill river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  16624j of this chapter if the downstream capacity analysis is a part of the noharm justification any noharm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the stormwater management plan submission attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1 the peak flow values to be used for the downstream areas for the design return period storms two five ten twentyfive fifty and onehundredyear shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff model psrm for the stony creeksaw mill run watershed these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the township engineer upon request 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if the developers site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage the developer may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls that would generate increased peak flow rates at documented storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  16624j of this chapter h individual lots within a subdivision when a site is proposed to be subdivided for the sale and development of lots on an individual basis either by the subdividing party or other party the subdividing party shall as part of the subdivision proposal show all provisions for  16623 shopping carts  16623   16624 calculation methodology stormwater control in accordance with the requirements of this chapter i regional or subregional detention alternatives for certain regions within the watershed it may be more cost effective to provide one control facility for an entire subarea group of subareas or portion of a subarea incorporating more than one development site plan to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional or subregional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated stony creeksawmill run version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the requirements of this chapter j capacity improvements 1 in certain instances primarily within the provisional nodetention and provisional onehundredpercent release rate category areas local drainage conditions may dictate morestringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of development controls on the development site any capacity improvements would be designed based upon the development of all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and the capacity criteria specified in  16624c of this chapter in addition all new development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with this chapter except that all new development within the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any 2 capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to implement a modified noharm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to document the validity of a lessstringent discharge control that would not create any harm downstream a approved methodology stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using
