and other documentary evidence the city council finds aadult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no statewide mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises bcertain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined in ohio rc 376801 as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments csexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows the couch dances or lap dances that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of engaging in prostitution under ohio rc 290725 doffering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions epersons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments fnumerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv aids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid gsince 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 198 and 253448  ha total of 10255 aids cases had been

reported annually has risen 33613 cases were reported in 198 and 45200 cases were reported  kthe number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over one half million cases being reported in 1990 lthe surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse and exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn maccording to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts nsanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities othe findings noted in divisions 2 a to n of this section raise substantial governmental concerns padult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be
