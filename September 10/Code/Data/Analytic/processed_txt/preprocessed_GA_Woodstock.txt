stormwater utility services define the scope of responsibility establishes an enterprise fund credit and appeal policies billing and collection policies and other policies and procedures related to establishing the stormwater utility  findings the city council makes the following findings 1 the federal clean water act as amended by the water quality act of 1987 33 usc 1251 et seq and rules promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency pursuant to the act emphasize the role of local governments in developing implementing conducting and funding stormwater management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff 2 stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city 3 stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare and the environment providing stormwater management services systems and facilities renders both service and benefit to individual parcels parcel owners citizens and residents of the city 4 the area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a stormwater service charge 5 a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas 6 stormwater runoff is associated with all developed properties whether residential or nonresidential and the impacts of runoff from individual properties are directly related to the amount of impervious surface on a property 7 the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city properly assesses the stormwater management needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 8 the professional engineering and financial analyses identified a need to meet these goals and establish a funding mechanism in the city dedicated specifically for generating consistent stable and adequate revenue to fund stormwater management services 9 stormwater management is applicable and needed city limits of woodstock while specific service and facility demands vary from location to location a service area that encompasses all lands and water bodies within the geographic limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 10 the city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare of the community and the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development implementation and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith 11 considering these findings the city council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities and the city council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater

sewers design gravity sewers and force mains as separate sanitary sewers only in which rainwater from roofs streets and other areas and groundwater from foundation drains are excluded do not permit overflows from sewers   design factors 1 consider the following factors in determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers a maximum hourly sewage flow  b additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants  c ground water infiltration  d topography of the area  e depth of excavation 2 design new sewers on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than four hundred 400 gallons per household per day design gravity sewers to carry the per peak capita flow when flowing onehalf full normally design all sewers with a peaking factor of not less than two and onehalf 212  this may be increased upon the direction of the city engineer when deviations from the foregoing per capita rates are demonstrated include a description of the procedure used for design 3 design sewage lift stations for peak flow with one 1 pump offline 4 design sewer systems for the estimated ultimate tributary population tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed design and install sewers to the uppermost property line of the development being served consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions industrial parks etc   state approval all sanitary sewer developments must obtain approval from the georgia department of natural resources before beginning construction

inch 008 27 inch 007 30 inch 006 36 inch 005 b these minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two 20 feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line place sewers with uniform slope between manholes use case iron or ductile iron pipe sewers on twenty 20 percent slope or greater and anchor securely with concrete anchors to prevent displacement by erosion or shock build the inverts of manholes connecting grades of twenty 20 percent or more with close fitting concrete block limit maximum slope of sewers to thirty 30 percent and design at less than twenty 20 percent whenever possible 4 provide three 3 feet minimum cover for any sewers on off street easements unless cast iron or ductile iron pipe is used filling over the pipe

and condition the following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify 1 minimum size criteria a twentyfour 24 inch caliper at dbhoak beech ash blackgum sycamore hickory maple does not include silver maple pecan walnut magnolia does not include bigleaf magnolia persimmon sourwood cedar cypress or redwood b thirty 30 inch caliper at dbhtulip poplar sweet gum river birch silver maple or pine c ten 10 inch caliper at dbhamerican holly dogwood redbud or other genus as determined by the city arborist such as bigleaf magnolia 2 condition criteria a life expectancy greater than fifteen 15 years b relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay or significant structural deficiencies c no more than two 2 major and several minor dead limbs excluding pine for minor limbs d a radial trunk dieback of no more than twenty 20 percent or a canopy dieback of no more than thirty 30 percent 3 small trees can be classified as specimen if of a rare or unusual species of exceptional quality or sociohistorical significance small trees may also qualify as specimen if used in a landscape as a focal point of the design in order to claim this credit the applicant must submit a letter from a certified arborist stating that the trees meet these qualifications 4 an arborist report for each specimen tree that is shown to be impacted by a proposed development requiring an ldp must be submitted to the city to determine whether that tree meets the condition criteria for specimen status the report must be prepared and signed by a certified arborist or a registered forester the report must contain the following information a site plan showing an accurate surveyed location of the tree b identificationverification of the trees size genus and species c description of the surrounding site conditions d detailed description of the trees condition e digital photographs to illustrate any defects which would disqualify the tree from specimen status 5 the final determination of specimen tree status will be made by city staff after reviewing the report a if a specimen tree is to be removed a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for removal must be submitted to the city b the removal of any specimen tree impacted by a proposed development must be mitigated by replacing the removed specimen tree with minimum four 4 inch caliper trees of comparable species on an inchforinch replacement basis example twentyfour 24 inch oak would require replanting six 6 four 4 inch caliper trees 24  4   6 these recompense trees are in addition to the minimum one hundred 100 inches per acre for a particular site c any person who removes a specimen tree in violation of this be assessed a fine in accordance with regard to specimen trees removed after being designated for preservation on an approved plan the removed tree must also be replaced on an inchforinch basis with tree species with potential for comparable size and quality regardless of the one hundred 100 inches per acre requirement if a tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition size alone will be the determining factor for replacement in regard to specimen trees removed on a residential lot that is not currently being developed the fine shall be paid as referenced however there shall be no requirement for replacement of the specimen tree 6 in order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of new development projects the following incentive is offered preserved specimen trees will receive one and onehalf 15 x inches dbh thirty 30 inch oak x one and onehalf 15   fortyfive 45 inches under no circumstance will this incentive allow the requirements of the tree preservation be reduced administratively 1  2exh a   tree protection standards allowing enough space for a trees root system is a

connections ch 58 section 5844 city ordinances state law reference authority to provide for stormwater and sewage collection and disposal systems ga const art ix  ii para iiia6 article i  introduction purpose and intent   introduction it is hereby determined that land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural stormwater control as well as nonstructural stormwater management practice such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution  therefore the city of woodstock georgia sometime hereinafter referred to as city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharge in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff   purpose and intent the purpose of this chapter of the land development to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare of the city of woodstock georgia by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activity that protects the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management practices and stormwater better site design such as the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include green space with the citys green space protection plan  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and longterm follow up article ii  definitions and administrative all defined terms throughout this chapter are capitalized and the

standards article i  general provisions   findings purpose and intent 1 the city finds that billboard signs are a proper use of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such billboard signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of billboard signs tends to proliferate leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares and highways in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their billboard signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the billboard sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises 2 regulation of the size height number and spacing of billboard signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of billboard signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens 3 the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signage erected by public authority and billboard signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going as such with the exception of signage identifying government buildings virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes moreover their use in the public rightofway is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public 4 the purpose of this chapter is to encourage the effective use of billboard signs as a means of communication within the city  to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the citys ability to attract sources of economic development and growth  to improve traffic safety  to minimize the possible adverse effect of billboard signs on nearby public and private property  and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this article 5 in considering the appropriate level of billboard sign regulation for the city the mayor and council have considered planning studies reports news articles and related information from a variety of sources the mayor and council have determined that billboard signs with electronic and led display technology pose unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractibility than nonled billboard signs in addition billboard signs with electronic and led display technology are inconsistent with the aesthetic standards established

60 inches from the original ground surface at these depths the absorption is favorable and is expressed as part of the footnote 3 depth to bedrock is generally not sufficient to accommodate an absorption field there are some small areas of these soils that have adequate depths and test borings are needed to identify these 4 flooding andor a seasonally high water table makes these soils unsuitable sites for absorption fields 5 flooding or standing water during brief periods of high rainfall makes many areas of these soils unsuitable even though the absorption rate is favorable areas protected from flooding or otherwise not subject to flooding may be suitable 6 a seasonally high water table due to position in landscape makes most areas of these soils unsuitable however the physical makeup of many of these soils contain enough sandy material at sufficient depths 3 to 4 feet that the seasonal water table can be lowered by this potential the letter s indicates special

air from the atmosphere the air in a well aerated soil is similar to that in the atmosphere  the air in poorly aerated oil is considerably higher in carbon dioxide and lower in oxygen aggregate soil many fine particles held in a single mass or cluster natural soil aggregates such as granules blocks or prisms are called peds clods are aggregates produced by tillage or logging aulluvium material such as sand silt or clay deposited on land by streams bottom land the normal flood plain of a stream subject to flooding clay as a soil separate mineral soil particles less than  millimeter in diameter as a soil textural class soil material that is 40 percent or more clay less than 45 percent sand and less than 40 percent silt colluvium soil material rock fragments or both moved by creep slide or local wash and deposited at the base of steep slopes depth of rock bedrock is too near the surface for the specified use drainage class natural refers to the frequency and duration of periods of saturation or partial saturation during soil formation as opposed to altered drainage which is commonly the result of artificial drainage or irrigation but may be caused by the sudden deepening of channels or the blocking of drainage outlets seven classes of natural soil drainage are recognized excessively drained water is removed from the soil very rapidly excessively drained soils are commonly very coarse textured rocky or shallow some are steep all are free of the mottling related to wetness somewhat excessively drained water is removed from the soil rapidly many somewhat excessively drained soils are sandy and readily pervious some are shallow some are so steep that much of the water they receive is lost as runoff all are free of the mottling related to wetness well drained water is removed from the soil rapidly but not rapidly it is available to plants throughout most of the growing season and wetness does not inhibit growth of roots for significant periods during most growing seasons well drained soils are commonly medium textured they are mainly free of mottling moderately well drained water is removed from the soil somewhat slowly during some period moderately well drained soils are wet for only a short time during the growing season but periodically they are wet long enough that most meophytic crops are effected they commonly have a slowly pervious layer within or directly below the solum or periodically receive high rainfall or both somewhat poorly drained water is removed slowly enough that the soil is wet for significant periods during the growing season wetness markedly restricts the growth of mesophytic crops unless artificial drainage is provided somewhat poorly drained soils commonly have a slowly pervious layer a high water table additional water from seepage nearly continuous rainfall or a combination of these poorly drained water is removed so slowly that the soil is saturated periodically during the growing season or remains wet for long periods free water is commonly at or near the surface for long enough during the growing season that most hydrophytic crops cannot be grown unless the soil is artificially drained the soil is not continuously saturated in layers directly below plow depth poor drainage results forma high water table a slowly pervious layer within the profile seepage nearly continuous rainfall or a combination of these very poorly drained water is removed from the soil so slowly that free water remains at or on the surface during most of the growing season unless the soil is artificially drained most mesophytic crops cannot be grown very poorly drained soils are commonly level or depressed and are frequently ponded yet where rainfall is high and nearly continuous they can have moderate or high slope gradients flood plain a nearly level alluvial plain that border a stream and is subject to flooding unless protected artificially fragipan a loamy brittle subsurface horizon low in porosity and content of organic matter and low or moderate in clay but high in silt or very fine sand a fragipan appears cemented and restricts roots when dry it is hard or very hard and has a higher bulk density than the horizon or horizons above when moist it tends to rupture suddenly under pressure rather than to deform slowly hardpan a hardened or cemented soil horizon or layer the soil material is sandy loamy or clayey and is cemented by iron oxide silica calcium carbonate and other substances horizon soil a layer of soil approximately parallel to the surface having distinct characteristics produced by soilforming processes in the identification of soil horizons an upper case letter represents the major horizons numbers or lower case letters that follow represent subdivisions of the major horizons an explanation of the subdivisions is given in the soil survey manual the major horizons of mineral soil are as follows 0 horizon an organic layer of fresh and decaying plant residue at the surface of a mineral soil a horizon the mineral horizon at or near the surface in which an accumulation of humified organic matter is mixed with the mineral material also a plowed surface horizon most of which was originally part of a b horizon e horizon the mineral horizon in which the main feature is loss of silicate clay iron aluminum or some combination of these b horizon the mineral horizon below an 0 a  or e horizon the b horizon is in part a layer of transition from the overlying horizon to the underlying c horizon the b horizon also has distinct characteristics such as an accumulation of clay sesquioxides humus or a combination of these  prismatic or blocky structure  redder or browner colors than those in the a horizon  or a combination of these the combined a and b horizons are generally called the solum or true soil if a soil does not have a b horizon the a horizon alone is the solum c horizon the mineral horizon or layer excluding indurated bedrock which is little affected by soilforming processes and does not have the properties typical of the a or b horizon the material of a c horizon may be either like or unlike that in which the solum formed if the material is known to differ from that in the solum the arabic numeral 2 precedes the letter c r layer consolidated rock beneath the soil the rock commonly underlies c horizon but can be directly below an a or b horizon impervious soil a soil water air or roots penetrate slowly or not at all no soil is absolutely impervious to air and water all the time infiltration the downward entry of water into the immediate surface of soil or other material as contrasted with percolation which is movement of water layers or material infiltration capacity the maximum rate at which water can infiltrate into a soil under a given set of conditions infiltration rate the rate at which water penetrates the surface of the soil at any given instant usually expressed in inches per hour the rate can be limited by the infiltration capacity of the soil or the rate at which water is applied at the surface intake rate the average rate of water entering the soil under irrigation most soils have a fast initial rate  the rate decreased with application time therefore intake rate for design purposes is not a constant but is a variable depending on the net irrigation application the rate of water intake in inches per hour is expressed as follows less than 02 very low 02 to 04 low 07 to 075 moderately low 075 to 125 moderate 125 to 175 moderately high 175 to 25 high more than 25 very high loam soil material that is 7 to 27 percent clay particles 28 to 50 percent silt particles and less than 52 percent sand particles loamy soil ranging for

are artificially drained the water can be removed only by percolation or evapotranspiration poor filter because of rapid permeability the soil may not adequately filter effluent from a waste disposal system profile soil a vertical section of the soil extending its horizons and into the parent material runoff the precipitation discharged into stream channels from an area the water that flows off the surface of the land without sinking into the soil is called surface runoff water that enters the soil before reaching surface streams is called groundwater runoff or seepage flow from groundwater

more sand and not more than 10 percent clay sandstone sedimentary rock containing dominantly sandsize particles sedimentary rock rock made up of particles deposited from suspension in water the chief kinds of sedimentary rock are conglomerate formed from gravel  sandstone formed from sand  shale formed from clay  and limestone formed from soft masses of calcium carbonate there are many intermediate types some winddeposited sand is consolidated into sandstone seepage the movement of water soil seepage adversely affects the specified use series soil a group of soils that have profiles
