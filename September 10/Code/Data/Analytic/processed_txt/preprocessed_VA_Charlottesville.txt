the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief b generally the granting of variances will be limited to lots having a size of less than onehalf 12 acre  however circumstances may require the bza to deviate from this general provision however as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases variances may be issued by the bza for new construction or substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the bfe in conformance with the provisions of this section c variances may be granted by the bza for new construction substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this section are met and the structure use or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety d in considering applications for variances the bza shall consider relevant factors and procedures specified by state statutes and city ordinances and the bza shall also consider the following additional factors 1 the danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments no variance shall be granted for any proposed use development or activity within any floodway that will increase the bfe 2 the danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others 3 the proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease contamination and unsanitary conditions 4 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners 5 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community 6 the requirements of the facility for a waterfront

foreseeable future 9 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area 10 the safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood 11 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site 12 the historic nature of a structure variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon the additional determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the proposed variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 13 such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this division e the bza may refer any application for a variance and accompanying documentation to a professional engineer licensed by the commonwealth of virginia or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters f the board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance in writing that the approval of a variance to construct a structure below the bfe increases the risks to life and property and will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance a record shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator of this notification as well as all actions of the bza pursuant to this section including justification for the issuance of the variances any variances approved by the bza shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted by the floodplain administrator to the federal insurance

highways found by the city council to be significant routes of access to the city objectives of these districts include the following i creation of a dynamic street life encouraging the placement of buildings close to property lines andor heavily landscaped yard areas in order to engage pedestrians and deemphasize parking facilities  ii encouragement of mixeduse development  iii facilitation of development that demonstrates an appropriateness of scale  iv encouragement of development that offers creative minimization of the impact of parking facilities and vehicular traffic  v encouragement of landscaped spaces available for pedestrian use eg pocket parks treelined streets and walkways  vi encouragement of alternate forms of transportation eg pedestrian travel bicycle paths use of public transit  vii encouragement of neighborhoodenhancing economic activity  viii encouragement of home ownership  and ix encouragement of neighborhood participation in the development process b the districts in which such development is encouraged fall generally into two 2 categories 1 commercialresidential mixed use districts with little remaining vacant land the citys continued vitality depends upon its ability to attract and facilitate a harmonious mixture of commercial and residential development and redevelopment generally each of these zoning districts seeks to encourage a mixture of residential commercial and cultural uses within a single building or within multiple related buildings and structures of particular importance is the creation of corridors to serve as vital centers for economic growth and development while at the same time encouraging development that is friendly to pedestrians and alternate modes of transportation characteristic of an urban setting 2 commercialindustrial mixed use districts each of these zoning districts seeks to provide an area in which important industrial uses of limited scale may be located but in which opportunities for incorporation of related or harmonious commercial uses can be facilitated 519083 mixed use districtsintent and description 1 downtown corridor the intent of the downtown corridor district is to provide for a mixture of commercial and residential uses and encourage such development by right according to standards that will ensure harmony with the existing commercial environment in the citys

subsection hereinafter critical slopes provisions are intended to protect topographical features that have a slope in excess of the grade established and other characteristics in the following ordinance for the following reasons and whose disturbance could cause one 1 or more of the following negative impacts a erosion affecting the structural integrity of those features b stormwater and erosionrelated impacts on adjacent properties c stormwater and erosionrelated impacts to environmentally sensitive areas such as streams and wetlands d increased stormwater velocity due to loss of vegetation e decreased groundwater recharge due to changes in site hydrology f loss of natural or topographic features that contribute substantially to the natural beauty and visual quality of the community such as loss of tree canopy forested areas and wildlife habitat these provisions are intended to direct building locations to terrain more suitable to development and to discourage development on critical slopes for the reasons listed above and to supplement other regulations and policies regarding encroachment of development into stream buffers and floodplains and protection of public water supplies 2 definition of critical slope a critical slope is any slope whose grade is 25% or greater and a a portion of the slope has a horizontal run of greater than twenty 20 feet and

maintains the stability of the property andor the quality of adjacent or environmentally sensitive areas  groundwater recharge  reduced stormwater velocity  minimization of impervious surfaces  and stabilization of otherwise unstable slopes  or ii due to unusual size topography shape location or other unusual physical conditions or existing development of a property one 1 or more of these

change the size and scope of the existing use of the subject property and the magnitude of such change  and b whether the proposed use will increase the intensity of use of the subject property including hours of operation traffic noise and similar impacts  and c whether the proposed use will have a more or less detrimental effect than the existing nonconforming use upon conforming uses within the surrounding neighborhood  and d how the quantum effect of the factors evaluated in preceding subsections a b c relate to the purpose policies and objectives of this chapter 3 a
