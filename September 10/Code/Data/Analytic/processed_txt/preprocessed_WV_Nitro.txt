editors note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes chapters articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is i the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code i and the section number islo this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes chapters and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future leg isla tion articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains
