chapter and any other provision of title 17 this chapter shall control  2017  purpose and intent the purposes of the individual combiningoverlay zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows a fp floodplain overlay zone the intent of the floodplain overlay zone is to safeguard those areas of the city subject to periodic flooding and accompanying hazards with the objective of promoting health safety and general welfare of the people of the city this overlay zone implements various general plan land use designations the objectives of the floodplain overlay zone are 1 to prohibit occupancy or the encroachment of any structure improvement or development that would obstruct the natural flow of floodwaters within a designated floodway on the floodplain  2 to keep developments in the remainder of the floodplain above the design flood flow elevation  and 3 to prevent economic loss caused by excessive flooding and to prevent loss of life or property b gh geologic hazards overlay zone the intent of the geologic hazards overlay zone is to provide for suitable protection for areas subject to the threat of loss life andor personal property due to seismic shaking and resultant ruptures or ground failure landslides and other potential geologic hazards more specifically this overlay zone will allow the city to exercise the mandated approval authority within special study zones as established by the state geologist required by the provisions of the geologic hazards zones act division 2 of the california public resources  this overlay zone implements

building will be needed in order to provide for an efficient contemporary use  however these repairs and alteration must not damage or destroy materials features or finishes that are important in defining the buildings historic character for example certain treatmentsif improperly appliedmay cause or accelerate physical deterioration of historic building this can include using improper reappointing or exterior masonry cleaning techniques or introducing insulation that damages historic fabric in almost all of these situations use of these materials and treatments will result in a project that does not meet the standards similarly exterior additions that duplicate the form material and detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the structure will fail to meet the standards b guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings all rehabilitation projects shall also follow the guidelines contained in the secretary of the interiors

applies to all wireless telecommunications facilities existing and proposed to be located within the corporate boundary of the city of loma linda except wireless telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway which are subject to the intent of the wireless communications ordinance is to promote general compatibility with other electrical and communication facilities in the city and to find locations for said facilities that are compatible with the height mass and visual character of surrounding buildings and public facilities by applying the same standards and aesthetic considerations to such facilities as apply to buildings and public facilities in the zone district in which they are proposed in applying these standards and any specific standards that will apply to such facilities the planning commission will consider wireless communication facilities as accessory structures subject to the following considerations for the same a as accessory facilities they

southerly side of the city provide a unique natural landmark which differentiates this portion of the city from other locations within the city  b foothill areas in the city range in geologic characteristics from steep rocky slopes to brushcovered regions  c development in brush or wooded regions requires recognition of various physical constraints  including fire hazards tree removal drainage and erosion visible scarring and delicate easily disturbed rock formations  d because of the uniqueness of these areas within the city special hillside development policies are needed to restrict andor control development on these significant natural resources  and e adoption of policies and procedures for reviewing proposed hillside area developments designed to ensure the preservation of natural hillside characteristics would contribute to the preservation andor conservation of the valuable scenic natural amenity of the city hillsides  1979  purpose a the purpose of

padding andor terracing of building sites  3 incentives to encourage variety in proposed developments on hillside areas mixture of housing types padding andor terracing techniques and with density allowances and amount of undisturbed areas based on slope analysis  4 measures to protect and conserve hillside ecosystems retention of unique natural topographic features and hillside characteristics including drainage patterns streams slopes ridgelines rock outcroppings vistas natural vegetation and migratory routes of animals  5 methods to preserve areas that may have an historic interest significance or educational value  6 standards of design to ensure streets which provide for the safe and convenient circulation of vehicles emergency equipment and pedestrians c in areas where

to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c on  the federal emergency management agency fema revised the flood insurance rate map firm and flood insurance study fis report to redesignate the flood hazard area along san timoteo creek as a special flood hazard area known as zone a99 fema recommends that as a minimum the building restriction and flood proofing requirements within zone a99 be identical to zone x  2008  2002   1987  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to

university town surrounded by open spaces including undeveloped hills and agricultural and citrus producing lands is cherished by its residents residents of loma linda perceive the city as a community of homes and businesses where grown children are eager to return to raise their families b uncontrolled high density urban development would permanently alter the character of the city and threaten the public health safety and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion associated air pollution noise and higher crime rates costly expansion of public facilities and services including police and fire services would be required to meet the needs of a rapidly urbanizing community this would create inevitable conflicts between urban and rural uses within the city and would permanently degrade the quality of life experienced by its residents c the hillside areas within the city and its sphere of influence contribute to the communitys health and welfare by providing open space natural beauty wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities development of these critical hillside areas at no more than the maximum allowable densities set forth in this initiative measure will minimize the need for and costs of extension of city services such as sewer water streets utilities and emergency services limiting densities in the hillside areas will minimize the need for grading and land form alteration and contribute to the public health safety and welfare by reducing the risks of landslides fires erosions slope instabilities floods earthquakes and related hazards which often occur when steep hillsides are developed at higher densities d the loma linda general plan is comprised of resolution 105 which was adopted on  and all amendments adopted  the loma linda general plan the loma linda general plan also includes an initiative measure  enacted by a vote of the people in 1993 to address hillside conservation issues and an amendment to that initiative measure which was adopted by a vote of the people in 1996  is codified at of the loma linda municipal  are collectively referred to in this initiative measure as the hillside conservation amendments this initiative measure is intended to support and expand the hillside conservation amendments as growth management tools and to include areas of land not previously subject to those provisions of law as well as to address other growth management related issues that affect urban development in the city e the purpose and intent of this initiative measure is to amend the loma linda general plan by the addition of a new growth management element designed to establish principles of managed growth that will preserve enhance and maintain the special quality of life valued by this community including the protection of hillside areas preservation of open space and maintenance of safe quiet residential areas so that future development within the city will occur in a way that promotes the social and economic wellbeing of the entire community f this initiative measure is consistent with and furthers the explicit policy of the state of california set forth in california government which reads in relevant part as follows the discouragement of premature and unnecessary conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is a matter of public interest and will be of benefit to urban dwellers themselves in that it will discourage discontiguous urban development patterns which unnecessarily increase the costs of community services to community residents in a rapidly urbanizing society agricultural lands have a definite public value as open space and the preservation in agricultural production of such lands the use of which may be limited under the provisions of this chapter constitutes an important physical social esthetic and economic asset to existing or pending urban or metropolitan developments g the maximum allowable densities set forth in this initiative measure for the city and for its hillside areas as designated in this initiative measure are reasonable and appropriate these limitations and regulations relating to growth within the city are intended to provide for appropriate management of city resources and to reduce the risks of fires landslides and other geologic hazards h if adopted this initiative measure will continue to allow sufficient development of housing consistent with land designations and zoning within the city and its sphere of influence as they currently exist and as they are amended by this measure to meet the citys regional fair share housing obligations for the foreseeable future  2006  substantive general plan amendment a establishment of new entitled growth management element to achieve the purpose of this measure the existing general

preservation  statement of purposes and intent a the overall intent and purpose of this chapter is to recognize the importance of preserving the significant natural hillside amenities within the boundaries of the city of loma linda the reasons for preserving the hillside areas include 1 provide for preservation of the unique flora and fauna of this area  2 provide visual relief from our rapidly urbanizing area  3 minimize fire flood earthquake erosion and other natural hazards  4 provide a natural buffer for the city proper  5 minimize the costs of extending streets utilities and other services to difficult terrain  6 achieve the goals of the conservation and open space elements of the general plan as herein amended to preserve significant hillside areas  7 provide for trails and other natural environmentally sensitive accesses to assist in meeting the recreational needs of the city b it is further the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide within those areas defined by this chapter as conservation areas for a density and pattern of development consistent with the terrain and high visual profile and unique characteristics of the areas so defined which will provide a reasonable use to landowners consistent with the terrain and the foregoing objectives  1996  1993  findings a a maximum density of one unit per ten acres with the possibility of a maximum density of up to one unit per five acres where certain conditions are met is reasonable and appropriate for this rugged hillside terrain b loma lindas general plan as herein amended designates the most critical hillside areas as conservation in its conservation and open space elements the intent is to preserve the sensitive hillside areas so defined by ensuring lower density development on private lands and open space on city acquired land to ensure that conservation objectives are part of the long range plan for the hillside areas c it is necessary and appropriate to designate the critical areas of the south hills as conservation areas authorization for development at a density of one unit per ten acres and upon certain conditions up to one per five acres is the maximum density that can be permitted consistent with the overall purposes and conservation goals of this chapter a density bonus of up to one unit per five acres is acceptable only where clustering and additional public benefits are provided as herein specified d development of these critical hillsides at one unit per ten acres and up to one per five acres will minimize the need for the city to extend service such as sewer water streets and other utilities will minimize the risks of fire erosion flood earthquake and related hazards which often occur when steep hillsides are developed at higher densities and will minimize the need for grading and land form alteration  1996  1993  hillside conservation area defined for the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings hillside conservation area means that area described on exhibit b set out at the end of this chapter and depicted on exhibit a also set out at the end of this chapter  1996  1993  exemptions

units per acre d medium density five to 10 dwelling units per acre e high density 11 to 20 dwelling units per acre 3  of planning elements of the general plan is amended by adding the following as a new third paragraph under the heading land use element hillside conservation  the hillside conservation area of the city is comprised of the most significant hilly and sensitive area of the southern portions of the city limited development at one unit per 10 acres and under certain specified criteria development at one unit per 5 acres is permitted greater development intensity would be inconsistent with the overall goals of this general plan to preserve and protect the natural scenic and other amenities of this sensitive area the limited density is necessary to minimize costs to taxpayers for extensions of services and to minimize the risks of fire flood erosion earthquake and other hazards which are normally attendant upon higher density development of difficult hillside terrain 4  land use of the general plan is amended by adding the following directly under land use category hillside conservation  gross acres approximately 1157 5 the circulation element of the general plan is amended by addition of the following immediately above the major highways category on  those areas designated hillside conservation should be developed with the minimum number of roads possible with clustering of development strongly encouraged to minimize the need for access roads no should be permitted in this area with the exception of oakwood drive extended continuously to connect to scotch lane and reche canyon road as shown conceptually on exhibit a intended primarily to serve areas outside of the hillside conservation area the purpose of limitations on is to minimize the adverse impacts of those roads which are necessary within the conservation area other than the oakwood drive extension should minimize cut and fill should avoid disruption of important natural habitat sensitive areas and view areas and should be designed to fit the hilly terrain by following contour lines using minimum pavement widths relaxed curve and other standards and slow speeds 6 the conservation element of the general plan beginning at  is amended by addition of the following immediately under the first paragraph on  hillside conservation area that area designated hillside

not greater than one unit per 10 acres unless the criteria specified by the hillside conservation land use designation are met in which event development at a maximum of up to one unit per 5 acres is permitted other consistent uses should be limited to riding hiking and other trails educational and research activities consistent with conservation of the area in addition uses normally accessory to

upon certain terms provisions and conditions  and whereas during the course of the negotiations to derive this the prior franchise expired and the operator continued to occupy the public rightsofway of the city under the terms of the prior franchise during the period of continued negotiations  and whereas the city is now convinced that this as it has heretofore resulted from such negotiations

allowed by law provided only that the city use its best efforts to impose similar or equivalent terms provisions and conditions to those set forth herein when it is within citys lawful power so to do  and whereas the city has following reasonable notice conducted a public hearing affording all persons reasonable opportunity to be heard which proceeding was for the purpose of considering authorizing a franchise for a community antenna television system establishing rules and regulations regarding such services and consideration of the technical ability financial condition legal qualification and general character of operator  and whereas the city after such consideration and deliberation has found and determined sufficient the technical ability financial condition legal qualification and

declare that the franchise of the operator shall be forfeited and terminated or it may make termination conditional subject to compliance within such period as the city council may fix such period not be less than sixty 60 days f the issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the city council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance the city council then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the operator has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period in its discretion liquidated damages at the time of issuance of this franchise it is impractical to reasonably ascertain the total extent of damages which may be incurred as a result of the breach by the operator of its obligations under the franchise accordingly the provisions of this section shall apply in the event of breach as liquidated damages therefor factors relating to the impracticability of ascertaining damages include but are not limited to the following a the fact that i the primary damage resulting from breaches by the operator of the schedules for construction and extension of the cable system and provision of services and of the duties prescribed by the terms provisions and conditions of this franchise will be to members of the public who are denied services or denied quality or reliable services  ii such breaches cause inconvenience anxiety frustration and deprivation of the benefits of the franchise to individual members of the general public in subjective ways and in varying degrees of intensity which are incapable of measurement in precise monetary terms  iii that services might be available cable system which are both necessary and available at a substantially lower cost than alternative services and the monetary loss resulting from denial of services or denial of quality or reliable services is impossible to calculate in precise monetary terms  and iv termination of a franchise for such breaches and other remedies are at best a means of future correction and not remedies which make the public whole for past breaches  b the fact that the failure of the operator to make timely reports identifying its progress in installing its cable system will make it difficult in ways which are not measurable for the city to administer the construction schedule delay initiation of enforcement proceedings and impede compliance with the period allowed for construction  and c the fact that the failure of an operator to file timely annual reports will deny information necessary to enable the city to expeditiously effectively and efficiently administer the franchise and exercise its regulatory powers in relation thereto for the promotion and protection of the public convenience health safety and welfare without the provisions relating to the imposition of liquidated damages below the actual damages for which an operator would be liable could greatly exceed the specified amount of liquidated damages therefore these provisions are of great benefit to the operator in its sole discretion the city council may assess the operator and the operator shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of up to one thousand dollars $1000 for each calendar day on which operator is in breach and for each breach of any of the terms provisions and conditions of this franchise or such other provisions of any subsequent rule order regulation or determination of the city made pursuant to the franchise as shall expressly refer to this provision said liquidated damage sum shall be separately applicable to each calendar day of delay in complying with any of the terms provisions and conditions of this franchise said liquidated damage amount shall be separately applicable to each instance for each calendar day of delay in extending lines to additional dwelling units  provided that if more than one dwelling unit is subject to a particular extension the total liquidated damages shall not exceed one thousand dollars $1000 for each calendar day of delay nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to preclude the city from imposing such lesser sum of liquidated damages as in its sole and exclusive discretion it shall deem fair and just the foregoing liquidated damages shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the types of breaches above neither the right to assess liquidated damages nor the assessment of liquidated damages shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the city to obtain judicial enforcement of the operators obligations by means of
