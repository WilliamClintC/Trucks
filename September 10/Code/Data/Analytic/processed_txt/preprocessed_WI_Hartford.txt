should produce and promote descriptive literature with photographs and drawings to assist owners and tenants in the district in planning to preserve and enhance existing structures c materials  1 materials used in original construction should also be used in restoration in rehabilitation materials that give the same visual appearance as existing original parts of the building should be used generally in hartford this is either brick or dressed stone but in some cases clapboard board and batten or stucco etc may be in keeping with original construction brick and other materials used in restoration should be selected to conform to the dimensions of existingoriginal materials brick should also conform in color texture and surface treatment to existingoriginal brick other materials should coordinate in color texture and surface treatment with nearby buildings 2 exposed aggregate fieldstone boulders split rock concrete or cinder block aggregate panels aluminum steel or vinyl siding should not be permitted vertical or horizontal board and batten shingles or clapboards should not be permitted unless they are aesthetically acceptable and compatible with the style of the building and nearby buildings 3 mortar joints the masonry wall should appear visually as masonry in restoration care should be taken not to damage the brick thereby creating larger joints than were original to the specific building no exaggerated uneven or oddly colored mortar joints should be used mortar should not contrast vividly with the masonry 4 glazing clear or slightly tinted glass or polymeric glazing material should be used no mirror glass should be permitted glass blocks are also out of character and thus inappropriate 5 materials and methods of construction which will lead to

the existing buildings in the district b height  floor heights on main facades should appear visually in proportion to those of adjoining buildings there should be no more than one story difference between a new building and those on either side buildings should be not more than three stories in height c width  new buildings should reflect the characteristic rhythm of facades along the street if the site is large the mass of the facade can be broken into a number of smaller bays in hartford these bays should be of no less than 20 feet nor more than 40 feet in width d proportion  the characteristic proportion relationship between height and width of existing facades should be maintained e relationship to street  new buildings should be built to the property lines like adjoining buildings f roof forms  flat or gently sloping roofs not visible from the street should be used roof forms should be similar to those on adjacent buildings mansards pents gables gambrels or other outofcharacter roof shapes should not be used roofs should not overhang g composition  the organization of the various parts of the facade should be similar to that of surrounding facades in this district the composition consists of 1 a shopfront on the first floor which should contain display windows that are aesthetically acceptable and compatible with the style of the building and nearby buildings in most cases display windows should be large 2 a traditional visual horizontal division between the first and second stories such as corbelling a string course or contrasting stone 3 upper story windows should have a minimum height of 112 times their width and be double hung oneoverone twoovertwo or fouroverfour 4 bay windows should be used only on upper stories 1417 5 a terminating feature such as a cornice corbelled brick a parapet or coping stone should complete the facade at the roofline h architectural rhythm  architectural rhythm which carries throughout the block such as window spacing should be incorporated into new facades in this district on the first floor this suggests large expanses of display windows no small paned windows should be permitted and on upper stories double hung rectangular round or segmentally arched windows should be placed singly or in pairs i proportion of openings  the size and proportion of window and door openings should be similar to those on surrounding facades the same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole where appropriate soft fabric awnings should be used for shade color or style j materials  new construction in the hartford downtown commercial hapeo district should be composed of materials which complement adjacent and nearby facades new buildings should not contrast sharply with others which meet the descriptions in iii for illustrative purposes examples of architectural styles which would tend to have elements which are incompatible with hartfords historic styles found in nearby facades include with no attempt to be inclusive spanish mission colonial scandinavian modern bavarian and french provincial in addition 1 in this district masonry brick or stone facing should normally be used brick should be of standard size 8 x 213 x 4 and of even coloration exposed aggregate fieldstone boulders split rock concrete or cinder block aggregate panels aluminum steel or vinyl siding should not be permitted vertical or horizontal board or batten shingles or clapboards should be permitted only if aesthetically acceptable one suggestion of aesthetic acceptability would be evidence that nonmasonry construction was used on a previous building of the same approximate configuration and style in the same location generally though nonmasonry new construction should be discouraged andif proposedevidence of meeting of may be requested 2 mortar jointsmasonry walls should appear visually as masonrynot as joints no oversize mortar joints skintling or other uncommon joints should be permitted black mortar or other mortar which contrasts with the masonry should not be used 3 glazingclear or slightly tinted glass or polymeric glazing materials should be used no

see facade renderings by r hartmann 1980 1982 l guidelines  all guidelines shall not conflict with state building codes or energy conservation codes the committee should produce and promote descriptive literature with photographs and drawings to assist property owners in the district in planning new construction which is complementary with existing facades 1418 m signs  signs convey necessary information and if harmonious add to the visual character of place they should be easy to read and unobtrusive signs should not obscure architectural details of a building each sign should be integrated with the buildings facade and requires individual attention to design multiple signs intended for the same structure should be designed as a unified scheme the booklet sign design

antennas and similar receptacles shall be placed on roofs toward the rear and should not project above the roof crest if possible utility meters should be placed on foundation walls as low as feasible aboveground service connections should be to the rear of the property room airconditioning apparatus should be positioned to the side or rear where it is least visible where this cannot be accomplished the device should be put in an existing window without disturbing the trim any infill of window space around the device should be accomplished with opaque weatherresistant material and should be painted to match the trim color of the window modern fixtures are generally considered to disfigure historic structures however they do have important functions and if well designed need be

significant amount of sediment nutrients bacteriaother pathogens organic matter toxins and other pollutants to local lakes streams and wetlands  b diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life  c clog drainage systems with sediment which in turn increases maintenance costs  d overwhelm existing drainage ways with increased flows causing bank and channel erosion and increasing downstream flooding and property damage  e reduce groundwater recharge which may diminish stream base flows andor lower water levels in local lakes ponds and wetlands  and f contaminate drinking water supplies g generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other offsite damage to property or the environment 2003 purpose and intent 1 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to set forth requirements for land disturbing construction activities aimed to minimize sedimentation water

existing singular or collective wastewater generators within approved sanitary sewer service areas and including unincorporated areas in the vicinity of the city based on certain scenarios parameters and elements 2 city sphere exurbia and suburbia areas there are widely differing scenarios regarding sewer service and therefore different approaches to the provision of sanitary sewer are appropriate in different situations three development tiers are described below and identified specifically on an extraterritorial sewer map for guiding the provisions of this policy a city sphere certain alreadydeveloped areas contiguous or proximate to city boundaries are citylike therefore ones perception of the city itself is affected by the appearance of these areas and the extent to which city amenities and services are available other vacant but proximate areas are easily serviced by city public works given state annexation laws which assume that cities will eventually annex nearby lands from surrounding towns the city clearly intends to retain the option in these city sphere areas to foster annexation or not as determined in each instance by the common council these areas are generally within onehalf mile of the city boundaries often encompass lands abutting the city limits and are referred to herein as the city sphere b exurbia certain alreadydeveloped and vacant areas are clearly separated from city boundaries by extensive agricultural or dormant tracts these areas are sufficiently distant from the city that they are perceived as not being in the city sphere are generally distant from city limits and are referred to herein as the city exurbia c suburbia certain areas between the city sphere and city exurbia are developed to varying degrees and may have been developed or are developable primarily because of the citys proximity these areas are characterized as being more difficult to service with sewer and other city services than the city sphere  yet they are sufficiently proximate to eventual city growth that it is expected that these lands will be part of the city sphere within 10 to 25 years this area will be referred herein as the city suburbia 3 provision of sewer in city sphere a annexation required in the city sphere sewer service has historically been associated with annexation and the city will continue to require that annexation precede sewer service except as detailed further in subparagraph 3 e or where the common council determines that annexation of a particular area is not in the citys best interest subject to common council review city staff is directed to assist property owners desiring annexation to assure that state law and municipal code provisions are met because sound planning requires that many considerations go into good boundary and sewer service configurations within the parameters of law staff assistance in configuring annexations which meet the overall needs of the petitioners and the city as interpreted by the common council is to be provided b propertyowner organization because sanitary districts can ultimately present administrative difficulties to the city if later wholly or partially annexed the city discourages their formation in city sphere areas preferring where appropriate the establishment of town utility districts c compensatory cost reductions in areas where annexation precedes sewer service city staff is directed to actively seek cost reductions where possible for the annexing property owners 2514 to compensate for other increased costs to them which are sometimes associated with annexation grant applications in the citys name will actively be pursued where practical and the city will otherwise encourage development within the context of existing policy d construction and operation of facilities unless there are unusual circumstances determined by the city council the city will construct operate and maintain the utilities extended to any city sphere property e property legally unable to annex any property which is legally incapable of being annexed to the city at the time of a request for services shall sign an annexation agreement prior to receiving service the agreement shall run with the land and provide for annexation of the land as soon as it is legally possible the agreement shall be executed by the property owner and filed with the city clerk along with an appropriate recording fee f charges for services the charges for operation and maintenance and capital costs for properties served within the city sphere shall be as follows i capital costs
