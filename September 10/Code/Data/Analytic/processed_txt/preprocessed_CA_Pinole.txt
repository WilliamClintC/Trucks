political process  however the financial strength of certain individuals or organizations should not permit them to exercise a disproportionate or controlling influence upon the election of candidates in pinole bthe increasing costs of political campaigns compel many candidates to raise larger percentages of money from interested groups with a specific financial stake in matters which may come before the pinole city council this has caused a public perception that votes may be improperly influenced by monetary contributions cthe tendency for campaign contributions to be dominated by a small number of very large contributors undermines the integrity of the governmental process the competitiveness of campaigns and the public confidence in local officials and local agencies  part 2008

importance to the city and its residents dto improve the disclosure of contribution sources in reasonable and effective ways eto restore public trust in governmental electoral institutions fto ensure that independent expenditures were not used to evade contribution limits gto prevent large contributors to independent expenditure committees from influencing candidates in the same way that candidates are influenced by large contributors who give to them directly hto prevent the corruption or appearance of corruption of candidates who have been given large contributions by independent

class i or ii ball users are subject to the prohibitions set forth in this chapter with such federal and state statutes and regulations as may apply and the specific pollutant limitations as may be promulgated by the city either by ordinance or by resolution cdomestic users under normal circumstances will not be required to apply or receive a wastewater discharge permit as defined in this chapter providing that the domestic user discharges only waste water which is consistent with the definition of domestic wastewater set forth herein dindustrial users may be subject to wastewater discharge permit requirements depending on the volume characteristics and origin of their wastewater discharge industrial users may be required to supply such information and data concerning their processes including discharge samples as may be necessary for the city to determine whether such user should be designated a class i or ii industrial users must when requested provide such other information regarding the nature of the entity its operations storage and use of chemicals and storage and use of hazardous substances as may be reasonably necessary to make such determination as to the classification of the user the city may also require information relating to potential for accidental discharges to the city facility of hazardous or prohibited substances such inquires may include information regarding the current disposal procedures of the user with regard to chemicals andor substances which are not in the ordinary course of users operations discharged to city facilities ethe determination by the city regarding the designation of an industrial user as a class i user may be based on the unusual character of the wastewater due to its volume strength composition or its derivation from a hazardous waste or substance or the potential variability in the character of the wastewater or on the potential for increased cost to the city due to the unusual character of the waste any administrative costs to be considered may include increased potential for the administrative oversight by federal state and local agencies as well as the potential for increased liability exposure and associated legal costs the city may also take into consideration difficulties in enforcement of the provisions of this chapter under a wastewater discharge permit and the enforcement violation and compliance history of the user with the city as well as other regulatory agencies the determination of the city regarding the designation of the industrial user as a class ii user may be based on whether the discharge of the wastewater is equal to or greater than five thousand gallons per average workday flow or whether the discharge has in its waste hazardous pollutants or whether the discharge is subject to national pretreatment standards or whether it has in its untreated wastewater pollutants which are in excess of any pretreatment standard or

do not coincide so that peak demand will not be greater than the parking provided  bthe efficiency of parking provided will equal or exceed the level that can be expected if parking for each use were provided separately 2shared parking agreement a written agreement between the landowners and in some cases the city that runs with the land shall be filed in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and include aa guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration in the uses that will create a greater demand for parking without application for approval of an amended use permit  ba reciprocal

recorders office bother parking reductions required parking for any use except a singlefamily dwelling second dwelling unit or two 2family dwelling may be reduced of a use permit by the planning commission 1criteria for approval the planning commission will only grant a conditional use permit for reduced parking if it finds that the project meets all of the conditional use permit criteria in conditional use permits and that three 3 or more of the circumstances listed below are true athe use will be adequately served by the proposed parking due to the nature of the proposed operation  proximity to frequent transit service  transportation characteristics of persons residing working or visiting the site  or because the applicant has undertaken a travel demand management program that will reduce parking demand at the site bparking demand generated by the project will not exceed the capacity of or have a detrimental impact on the supply of onstreet parking in the surrounding area cthe site plan is consistent with the objectives of the zoning district and incorporates features such as unobtrusive offstreet parking placed below the ground level of the project with commercial uses above or enclosed parking on the ground floor dthe applicant has provided onsite parking for car share vehicles via a recorded written agreement between the landowner and the city that runs with the land agreement shall provide for proof of a perpetual agreement with a car share agency to provide at least one 1 car share vehicle onsite 2application submittal requirements in order to evaluate a proposed projects compliance with the above criteria the zoning administrator may require submittal of a parking demand study that substantiates the basis for granting a reduced number of spaces  part 2010  special parking standards for old town apurpose special parking standards are established for the old town area for the following primary purposes 1spur growth in the core of old town by not requiring uses to provide more parking spaces than presently exist in the core  2manage the growth of old town by limiting the number of businesses offices lodges clubs and associations in the core of old town which may generate traffic or parking demands in excess of commercial office and public assembly parking availability causing the overflow of traffic and parking to spill over onto adjacent residential streets  3manage traffic circulation and parking capacity by periodically assessing parking capacity in the core of old town  4manage traffic circulation and parking by requiring reciprocal easement agreements between new parking lots and adjacent properties zoned for public facility commercial office or mixed use on which new parking lots can potentially be developed the provision of reciprocal easements is intended to reduce street traffic and the number of onstreet parking spaces used by allowing customers to find a space in an adjacent parking lot which may not be full bapplicability for the purposes of these zoning regulations the old town boundaries are defined by the northern side of park street the eastern side of john street the southern side of plum street and the western side of oak ridge road cspecial parking requirements for nonresidential uses generally nonresidential uses in the designated old town area are exempt from the parking requirements outlined in table 1 parking requirements by land use however new nonresidential uses and nonresidential uses that propose to expand by fifty percent 50% or more which would result in a parking demand of thirty 30% or more spaces may be subject to parking requirements if required criteria are met subsequent parking capacity assessment outlined herein dparking capacity assessment in order to provide development opportunity and adequate parking in old town the redevelopment agency has assembled property for shared parking and reduced standards as outlined herein to rely on this shared parking rather than compelling each business to satisfy parking demand onsite to ensure that adequate parking remains available the planning commission will periodically evaluate parking conditions in the old town in the form of a parking capacity assessment through analysis of that assessment the planning commission will determine whether the then current parking supply is adequate to meet the corresponding parking demand the following standards and criteria apply to the parking assessment and determination 1assessment frequency the city will evaluate and monitor parking supply and demand on a regular basis a parking capacity assessment shall be conducted the sooner of every two 2 years or after every fifth new use that would require ten 10 or more parking spaces as outlined in table 1 parking requirements by land use 2responsibility and content city staff shall prepare the parking capacity assessment for planning commission consideration the assessment shall include average and peak parking capacity in the designated old town area 3determination of parking adequacy the planning commission shall find that parking is adequate if parking demand does not exceed eightyfive percent 85% of the available capacity within a two 2block radius of a project 4parking controls the planning commission will implement parking controls eg time limits metered parking and remotely located employee parking before seeking to expand parking capacity 5shared parking the planning commission will consider expanding available shared public parking eg a parking garage in order to relieve individual projects of the obligation to provide parking onsite as determined by a parking management study ereciprocal easement agreements property owners of new parking lots are required to provide reciprocal easements to adjacent properties zoned for public facility commercial office or mixed use on which new parking lots could potentially be developed as determined by the city
