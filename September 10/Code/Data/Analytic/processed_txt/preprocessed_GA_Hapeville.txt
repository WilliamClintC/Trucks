hapeville georgia the city is aware of the following evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council of the city 1 findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 and young v american mini theatres 427 us 50 1976 and in articles and studies in other communities including but not limited to rome georgia  adams county colorado  new york new york  newport news virginia  el paso texas  manatee county florida  bellevue washington  kent washington  city of sandy springs georgia  fulton county georgia  phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  los angeles california  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma and other studies articles and court decisions  and 2 the opinion of the eleventh circuit court of appeals in flanigans enterprises inc of georgia v fulton county ga 596 f3d 1265 11th cir 2010 which discusses extensive evidence of negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments in fulton county georgia incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city  and 3 three articles authored or coauthored by dr richard mccleary professor at the university of california irvine entitled rural hotspots the case of adult business 2008  do peep shows cause crime a response to linz paul and yao 2006  and do offsite adult businesses have secondary effects legal doctrine social theory and empirical evidence 2009 incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city  and b based upon all of this evidence the mayor and council of the city find 1 sexually oriented businesses also known as adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas including but not limited to disorderly conduct prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use assaults and batteries and corruption of public officials 2 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex may occur at sexually oriented businesses offering or providing private or semiprivate space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 3 adult entertainment establishments escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions including but not limited to blight diminished property values increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council find such business establishments bring to a community the secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods commercial districts and on urban life in general these other types of such businesses include  but are not limited to adult bookstores peep shows massage parlors bath houses adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios 4 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 5 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses 6 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 7 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses 8 the findings noted in subsections 1 7 raise substantial governmental concerns 9 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 10 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein 11 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 12 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 13 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 14 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities as described above which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city  and based on the findings of multiple courts around the country  and based on the documentary evidence submitted to the mayor and council the mayor and council take note of the wellknown and selfevident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions in the same manner establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with commercial nudity and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are criminal activity depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove referenced the mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well unless these regulations are adopted furthermore it is the finding of the mayor and council that nude or seminude live entertainment and other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores peep shows adult theaters and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in the city and surrounding communities the mayor and council further find that each separate adverse secondary effect of adult entertainment businesses and sexually oriented businesses constitutes a substantial governmental interest that each substantial governmental interest includes but is not limited to preventing future adverse secondary effects of both preexisting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment businesses in the city and those that may open in the future and the viability of each separate substantial governmental interest of the city addressed herein does

article 4  stormwater utility short title this article will be known as the city stormwater utility ordinance  1 822016 general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect the public health safety environment and general welfare establishment of a stormwater utility in the city the objectives of this article are stated as follows 1 the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city 3 stormwater management is necessary throughout the city intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydrologics of stormwater systems with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities as a result the specific service system demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems an advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service fees should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level 4 it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the citys water and sewer revenue and water and sewer fund revenues and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate such revenues and funds to support stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service fee payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding 5 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare 6 provision of stormwater management programs and systems renders andor results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems 7 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs and systems may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management programs and systems and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater management programs systems which render or result in services and benefits 8 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater systems in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs 9 the mayor and council find conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city is service fees and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city b applicability the provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of hapeville c compatibility with other regulations this article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance rule regulation or other provision of law the requirements of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance rule regulation or other provision of law whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control d severability if the provisions of any section subsection paragraph subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section subsection paragraph subdivision or clause of this article e responsibility for administration the city manager shall administer implement and enforce the provisions of this article  1 822016 definitions credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service fee or other fees rates rentals charges fines and penalties to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational onsite stormwater system or facility or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities customer means all persons properties and entities served by andor benefitting from the utilitys acquisition

and to other developed lands hydrologic response means the manner whereby stormwater collects remains infiltrates and is conveyed from a property hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area the size shape topographic vegetative and geologic conditions of a property antecedent moisture conditions and groundwater conditions on a property impervious surfaces means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development common impervious areas

process on universal principles such as relationship of buildings to street  facade articulation  building orientation etc the standards are intended to balance historic urbanistic precedents in hapeville with new building typologies not historically found in the area as such these standards generally do not indicate specific architectural styles for most parts of the city the document contains both mandatory requirements indicated with shall and optional best practices indicated with should or where possible where a project does not meet the mandatory requirements the burden of varying from them is placed on the applicant in said case the applicant may solicit support for such variation by providing documentation that the proposed development is consistent with the spirit of

basis in adopting the hapeville arts district overlay zone the arts district overlay the city seeks to reinvent itself as a cultural destination particularly its walkable downtown the downtown has declined over the past 40 or more years likely the primary driver of that decline was expansion of hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport in the 1980s this expansion removed half the citys land base and nearly half the population having devastating impacts on retail trade and service industries secondary factors were the building of the interstate system that served as a bypass for travelers this effectively eliminated hapeville as a recipient of a very significant consumer market generated by east coast travelers and local commuters hapeville has also suffered from the general lack of investment characterizing atlantas southside reinforced by a failure of southside incomes and housing values to keep pace with atlantas north side finally closure of the hapeville ford plant removed a significant revenue base and spelled the need for a substantial retooling of the local economy as the regional and national economy rebounds the city seeks to create an intown arts identity that will attract air travelers local visitors and as importantly bolster consumer offerings for hapeville residents the arts district overlay will become a significant element of an economic development strategy that will capitalize on hapevilles airport location sense of place walkability and small town charm an important aspect of that development strategy is the assignment of property rights not available to owners outside the arts district overlay this reflects an emphasis on compact development supported by such public investment as streetscapes public parking public art wayfinding signs kiosks film festivals and community events the flexibility of building and site design and planned public investment are intended to foster an arts district that will establish downtown hapeville as a regional destination for the arts and for community celebrations dining and shopping  1 772015 definitions arts the interpretation of imagination and creativity in a physical
