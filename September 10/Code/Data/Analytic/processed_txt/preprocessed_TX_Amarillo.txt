private losses due to flood conditions in special flood hazard areas it has been designed to regulate and restrict uses of land that cause increases in flood heights or velocities and to prevent the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards this chapter seeks to control the alteration of natural floodplains and their protective barriers to regulate changes to stream channels and development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage the provisions of this chapter are designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for flood control projects by ensuring that developments are in compliance with comprehensive plans of the city  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that potential buyers are able to determine that property is in a special flood hazard area b in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restricts or prohibits land uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 requires that land uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controls the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 controls filling grading dredging and other development which might increase flood damage  5 prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will divert floodwaters or which might increase flood hazards to

reduced the same in writing to the planning and zoning commission the requirements of this chapter may be varied for the following 1 rehabilitation of structures listed on the national register of historic places or a state or local inventory of historic places provided that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 2 new construction or substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 12acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures equal to or above the base flood elevation provided the relevant factors of this chapter have been fully considered as lot sizes increase above the 12acre size the potential for higher runoff and flooding increases therefore the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases accordingly 3 the construction and use of storm cellars or fallout shelters in residential and nonresidential areas provided that the storm cellar or fallout shelter is not attached to any main structure and is not used for other than emergency occupancy  and provided further that all electrical heating and other mechanical equipment for storm cellars and fallout shelters shall be equal to or above the base flood elevation 4 substantial improvements where the lowest floor elevation is between the base flood elevation and one 1 foot above the elevation of the base flood d the city engineer may make a recommendation to the planning and zoning commission to grant a variance for lowering the lowest floor elevation required by this chapter all material necessary to elevate the building pad and its adjoining slopes shall be excavated from the area of the playa lake in accordance with in no event shall such variance reduce the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation adopted in the citys current floodplain management regulations unless the city allows otherwise under an appeal in accordance with any such appeal sustained by the city council could result in an amendment to this chapter and could cause a

shall constitute an offense punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars $100000 each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense punishable in accordance with  612010 findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the city of amarillo are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  612010 figure i flood schematic the following is figure 1  612010 chapter 49  airport
