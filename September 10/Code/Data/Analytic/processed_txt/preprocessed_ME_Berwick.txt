enlargement conforms to all the regulations of the district in which it is located or a variance is obtained except that dwellings in the residential districts which are situated entirely within the front setback area may be enlarged provided such enlargement does not encroach upon the existing front setback or upon any other required setback areas of the lot the addition of an open patio with no structures elevated above ground level shall not constitute the expansion of a nonconforming structure the addition of steps or the enclosure of an existing porch shall not constitute the expansion of a nonconforming structure but the addition of a deck shall constitute the expansion of a nonconforming structure and shall meet all the dimensional requirements of this ordinance construction or enlargement of a foundation beneath the existing structure shall not be considered an expansion of the structure provided that the structure and new foundation are placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board basing its decision on the criteria specified in section 52c4 that the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure  and that the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three additional feet 2 discontinuance discontinuance of the use of a

requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation 5 replacement a nonconforming structure on a nonconforming lot of record may by replaced or reconstructed provided that a the new structure is reconstructed or replaced within the footprint of the previous structure or that the new structure is located on the lot so that
