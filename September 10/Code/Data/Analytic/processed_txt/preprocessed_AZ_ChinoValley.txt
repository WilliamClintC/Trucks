sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material bbased on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glenn theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of the sexually oriented businesses 6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv aids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  8as of  there have been 5278 reported cases of alds in the state and 63 reported cases in yavapai county arizona 37 of which have died 9since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in yavapai county 10the number of cases of early less than 1 year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over one half million cases being reported in 1990 12the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self regulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16the findings noted in divisions b1 b15 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 17sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where the information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to the activity 23the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter 2001
