entertainment businesses especially those which provide private or semi private booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexuallyoriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities 5numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 6the findings noted in subsections 1 5 raise substantial governmental concerns 7adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 8a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that adult entertainment businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9the regulation of nudity in adult entertainment businesses will further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution

sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare   11requiring sufficient lighting in all adult entertainment businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of adult entertainment businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare   12the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of adult entertainment businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare   13a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in an adult

regulating the design of individual buildings and sites in the town center districts specifically tcd1 is determined in part by the extent to which they affect the public realm and the high quality character of the city council has determined of the master plan that the city desires an architectural theme in the buildings constructed in the town center particularly in tcd1 as such the city has established a goal to maintain a high quality of buildings including but not limited to architectural quality and character these architectural design standards standards have been adopted in pursuit of these goals bprinciples without limiting the generality of the planning and zoning the purpose of these standards is to protect the character of north royaltons tcd1 zoning districts and to preserve a high quality built environment throughout the town center area six principles are listed below these principles are a summary of the values that people in north royalton found to be most important in establishing the character of the town center these principles are policies that provide the foundation of both the standards and the architectural review process the planning commission shall look upon these principles as a framework for making discretionary decisions 1the creation and maintenance of the public realm takes precedence over individual buildings athe public realm is that space occupied both in physical and visual terms by the public it is created by such elements as the parts of the building that are visible from the street the front yard the sidewalk street trees and lighting and the street itself bthe town center especially the tcd1 areas will strongly influence the character of the city these areas of the city have a very diverse architecture the city expects the future development of these areas to be held together by a strongly defined public realm the public realm will be clearly delineated by the consistency of higher density development sidewalks and the shorter setback of buildings from the street the rhythm of the buildings the civic and institutional uses or structures provides another dimension of unity the public realm in all areas of the town center needs to have similar delineation although the particular dimensions and details are scaled to new kinds of buildings and lot patterns 2buildings shall maintain a high level of architectural quality architectural quality does not refer to specific style or details but to the general level of composition materials and design integrity these standards are meant to encourage a general style of western reserve building within the town center tcd1 of the city quality building design is a complicated matter which needs to balance many competing requirements 3the site plan and building shall respect the land and the environment in which they are placed an attractive city takes advantage of its natural setting buildings should be sited to minimize regrading and to take advantage of natural features including mature trees for the most part environmental issues are covered by the citys planning and zoning and building 4there shall be architectural variety within a defined framework the town center district should display a high degree of variety in its buildings the overall environment is nonetheless coherent because of the strength of the urban framework and a general uniformity of building scale variety within this coherent framework enriches the public realm 5new buildings and alterations shall respect the existing context and framework the design of any building shall be judged in reference to its site and the character of its surroundings not as an independent object the site plan for all new buildings shall be prepared with a clear understanding of the framework that exists or is being created in a particular area standards zoning and other regulations 6coordination with zoning and development standards the normal process of review of new building projects will require the applicant to satisfy zoning and development standards prior to being reviewed by the planning commission applicants are advised to review the planning and zoning

prevention of accelerated flooding and stream channel erosion in conjunction with urban development requires control of the discharge rate and volume of runoff prior to its release to offsite land the purposes of this chapter are to permit development without increasing the flooding of other lands and to provide a basis for the design of storm drainage systems on lands above or below undeveloped areas which design will preserve the rights and options of both contributing and receiving property owners and ensure the long term adequacy of storm drainage systems baccelerated channel erosion as well as increased flooding damage could be controlled if the predevelopment hydrograph could be maintained it is usually not practical however to retain the predevelopment rate of infiltration when a large part of the watershed is covered with impervious surfaces the concept of reducing peak flows below those of predevelopment storms was developed as an alternative to maintaining the predevelopment hydrograph the logic of this concept is to compensate for the increased erosiveness of 1increased volume of runoff due to less infiltration  2more frequent occurrences of the same flow for example a subdivision may have the peak flow of a predevelopment fiveyear storm occur once a year after development is complete 3less sediment in the runoff water because the watershed is paved with nonerosive surfaces or good grass cover cthe twostep standard requires that 1the peak rates of runoff from an area after development shall be not greater than the peak rates of runoff from the same area before development for all twentyfour hour storms from one to 100year frequency designing for the one two five ten twentyfive fifty and 100year storms is considered adequate to meet the requirement storm water requirements must be met at each point storm water is discharged from a development area 2if the volume of runoff from an area after development will be greater than the volume of runoff from the same area before development it shall be compensated by reducing the peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more frequent storms occurring on the development area to the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear frequency twentyfour hour storm occurring on the same area under predevelopment conditions storms of less frequent occurrence longer return periods than the critical storm up to the 100year storm shall have peak runoff rates not greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under predevelopment conditions dthe critical storm for a specific development area is determined as follows 1determine the total volume of runoff from a oneyear frequency twentyfour hour storm occurring on the development area before and after development  and 2from the volumes determined in paragraph d1 hereof determine the percent of increase in volume of runoff due to development and using this percentage select the twentyfour hour critical storm from the following table if the percentage of increase in volume runoff is the twentyfour hour critical equal to or   and less storm for discharge limitation greater than   than will be 0101 year 10202 year 20505 year 5010010 year 10025025 year 25050050 year 500 100 year this standard basically requires peak flow to be reduced in proportion to increased runoff volume if runoff volume is not increased peak flows are only required to match predevelopment peak runoff rates for equivalent size storms for all storms from oneyear to 100year storms this criteria is designed to require more control when the change in the runoff pattern caused by development is more drastic the quantity and cost of preventative control features will need to be in proportion to the level of increase in runoff caused by the change in land use a fair and equitable criterion econcern is frequently expressed in regard to the extremes of the accelerated storm water control standard the one and 100year frequency storms justification for using the oneyear storm is based on the erosivity of stream flow and on what is known as the routing problem small or frequent storms are very erosive simply because they occur so often damage doesnt have time to heal before the next storm comes bankfull channel flow is essentially the most erodible state of stream flow on the channel itself any increase spills out over the flood plain with very little increase in the velocity of channel flow any flow less than bankfull generally has a corresponding decrease in velocity and therefore less erosion damage to the channel where there is a significant increase in runoff volume it is very important to have the runoff occur at something less than bankfull flow especially in watersheds approaching complete development longer duration of bankfull flow than that which occurred under predevelopment conditions can have disastrous effects on the stream channel and resulting sediment pollution since channels generally size themselves for about one and onehalf to a twoyear frequency storm runoff event the oneyear storm was chosen as the control storm to prevent significant channel erosion fthe routing problem is the problem of channel flow downstream from numerous smaller watersheds as runoff from the smaller watersheds is altered the effect on channel flow somewhere downstream where all of the watersheds come together can be favorable or adverse ideally the entire large watershed should be hydraulically planned and the level of control of each subwatershed should be based on the accumulative effects downstream since experience has proven the near impossibility politically of realizing that degree of organizational control the oneyear outlet rate is further justified in order to minimize adverse effects on the routing problem when compensation is necessary to control increased flow volumes gmany people suppose that runoff peaks and volumes do not increase from the large or infrequent storm because the ground is saturated by these storms and most of the rainfall will run off whether the land is used for forest land crop land or urban purposes urbanization can in fact cause an increase in both peak and volume of runoff most of the increase may be in the early part of such a storm and perhaps the twentyfive or fiftyyear storm control may adequately address the situation there are many variables which affect the storm water runoff pattern  soil type slope kind of cover percentage of impervious cover kind of disturbance and compaction the 100 year storm needs to be examined in a development situation to determine its specific effect emergency flow areas and emergency outlets from structural work need to account for such storms if we dont want basements full of water and structures failing the additional control necessary for the 100year frequency storm is not a highly significant factor in storm water management for accelerated runoff control hin addition to controlling channel erosion this standard should make long range planning for storm water management easier storm sewers and stream channels can be designed in accordance with existing runoff conditions knowing that upstream runoff rates cannot be increased this standard would also prevent an increase in flood levels and frequencies below future developments and in many cases reduce development costs because of reduced storm sewer size particularly where multiple use detention facilities can be utilized in designated open space i a uniform standard for determining runoff would be helpful in designing to meet this standard we are requiring the us soil conservation service procedures in technical release no 55 1986 edition or latest edition which consider watershed area

quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream the method of implementing this chapter is by controlling uses and developments within a setback that would impair the ability of the riparian andor wetland area to 1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of floodwaters and regulating base flow 2stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks 3reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams 4reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants in
