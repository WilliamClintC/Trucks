familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 18 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes

part 2007   declaration of public nuisance a the abandonment of carts on public property or upon the public rightofway including but not limited to public streets and sidewalks as well as the unauthorized abandonment of carts upon private property constitutes a public nuisance that adversely effects the public health safety and welfare in multiple ways set forth in subsection b of this section below b the el monte city council has adopted this chapter in consideration of the following findings 1 abandoned carts contribute to visual blight that adversely impacts the image and quality of life in a community by contributing to a sense and atmosphere of neglect decay and public apathy abandoned carts can also become unsightly receptacles for trash and other debris and can even become trash themselves when damaged the proliferation of abandoned carts also has an adverse impact on property values and generally undermines efforts to promote individual responsibility for the maintenance upkeep and appearance of a community 2 abandoned carts are potential hazards to pedestrians and motorists alike as they can roll onto or block pedestrian and motor vehicle rightsofway and even block sidewalk access to wheelchair bound residents and other persons with impaired mobility 3 as determined by the american academy of pediatrics and news media reports on the subject the design of many carts poses an inherent danger to young children in the form of tipovers even when parents are present it follows that abandoned carts pose an even greater threat to children who are attracted to carts in the absence of any parental supervision whatsoever when such devices are left abandoned on public streets parks or other places where children pass or congregate 4 stolen and abandoned carts are all too frequently used to facilitate the unlawful scavenging of recyclable materials from cityauthorized waste receptacles thereby undermining the citys efforts to meet certain recycling and waste diversion goals 5 a significant number of the carts collected at the citys expense included carts that were not promptly collected by business establishments including those who purportedly retain the services of companies in the business of shopping cart or laundry cart retrieval the delayed or untimely retrieval of carts increases the likelihood that they will cause harm andor be misused 6 although the installation of physical containment measures will involve an initial investment in containment equipment a long term savings should be realized by business establishments consumersresidents and the city as the need for costly ongoing retrieval is diminished 7 et seq of the california business and professions hereinafter the state scheme the state scheme relates to the following i the manner by which abandoned carts which satisfy certain marking and identification requirements set forth under business and professions 1 may be impounded by municipalities  ii the circumstances under which certain statutorily specified penalties and costs may or may not be imposed upon the owner of a properly marked cart as a result of its abandonment by a thirdparty and subsequent impoundment by a municipality  and iii the circumstances under which the removal alteration or abandonment of a properly marked cart may be deemed unlawful and thereby become punishable as a misdemeanor 8 in recognition of finding in subsection b7 of this section this chapter is not in conflict with or otherwise preempted by the provisions of the state scheme in that provisions of this chapter do not expressly conflict with any provision of the state scheme and largely track the provisions of the state scheme 9 this chapter is found to satisfy the provisions of business and professions 8 which provides that the state scheme business and professions et seq shall not invalidate an ordinance of or be construed to prohibit the adoption of an ordinance by a citywhich

inevitable soil loss and to ensure that soil losses are kept below the tolerable limits  c erosion control elements shall be implemented as soon as practical in the development process except that the time elapsed shall not exceed sixty 60 days after the cessation termination or completion of grading whichever comes first 2 exposure of the soil disturbing activity should be held to the smallest practicable area and to the shortest practicable period of time consistent with maximum tolerable soil loss levels 3 appropriate provision should be made to accommodate increased storm water runoff and consequent soil loss occasioned by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development in addition to the use of vegetation and limitations on soil exposure as prescribed herein such provisions may include but are not limited to a installing and maintaining sediment basins debris basins desilting basins or silt traps to substantially reduce sediment from runoff water c whenever an

of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  2 the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  and 5 landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use b consistent with these legislative findings the purpose of this model ordinance is to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  5 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies  6 encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water such as implementing a tieredrate structure  and 7 encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the model water efficient landscape its local landscape ordinance c landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and esthetic benefits 2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3 conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment 4 protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced materials and using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion 5 protecting existing habitat and creating new

must be the minimum time period necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship the director may not grant any permanent exemption from this section nothing in this section is intended to limit any permit term to less than ten 10 years in the event that the amortization required in this section would reduce the permit term to less than ten 10 years for any permit granted on or after  then the minimum years allowed will be automatically extended by the difference between ten 10 years and the number of years since the city granted such permit nothing in this section is intended or may be applied to prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 usc  1455a on the basis that the subject wireless facility is a legal nonconforming wireless facility  872018 eligible facilities requests legislative intent a background a of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 201 pub l 11296 codified as 47 usc  1455a  generally requires that state and local governments may not deny and shall approve requests to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station federal communications commission fcc regulations interpret this statute and establish procedural rules for local review which generally preempt certain subjective landuse regulations limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential deemed granted remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty 60 days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified as 47 usc  332 applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg cellular wifi satellite microwave backhaul etc b findings the city council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values the city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with contained in a separate section devoted to will mitigate such potential confusion streamline local review and preserve the citys landuse authority to maximum extent possible c intent the city intends this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health safety and welfare consistent with and subject to federal and california state law for collocations and modifications to existing wireless facilities pursuant to related fcc regulations codified in 47 cfr   et seq this not intended to nor shall it be interpreted or applied to 1 prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service providers ability to provide personal wireless services  2 prohibit or effectively prohibit any entitys ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules regulations or other legal requirements for rightsofway management  3 unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services  4 deny any request for authorization to place construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such wireless facilities comply with the fccs regulations concerning such emissions  5 prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under federal or california state law  6 impose any unfair unreasonable discriminatory or anticompetitive fees that exceed the reasonable cost to provide the services for which the fee is charged  or 7 otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or california state law  872018   definitions the abbreviations phrases terms and
