protect the health safety and welfare of city residents and citizens to prevent blight and property deterioration in neighborhoods and to promote and maintain healthy sanitary conditions in all singlefamily rental dwellings located throughout the city recognizing the importance of such to the persons who do or may reside therein or in the vicinity the city also recognizes a compelling interest in establishing standards for the maintenance of sanitary and safe singlefamily rental dwellings within the city which will provide for the maintenance or property values of nearby properties  and the reduction and elimination of blight and other deleterious factors affecting neighborhoods and the quality of life within the city the city has received recommendations from citizen visioning groups indicating that an ordinance to address concerns relating to singlefamily rental dwellings is necessary to protect the health and welfare of the community and the city recognizes the unique nature of singlefamily rental dwellings versus multiple family and nonresidential rental buildings because in the citys experience 1 the maintenance of singlefamily rental dwellings is typically the obligation of a nonowning tenant or a nonoccupying offsite owner rather than an onsite manager or management company  2 unlike nonresidential rental buildings and apartment units singlefamily rental dwellings are typically located in neighborhoods consisting of owneroccupied singlefamily dwelling units where the deterioration and nonmaintenance of homes has a much more significant and direct negative impact on the quality of life character vitality appearance and value of property in the surrounding neighborhood affecting residents on a broad and large scale basis in the city  3 singlefamily rental dwellings are more often located in close proximity to other singlefamily residential structures and they therefore have a greater effect on the general health safety and welfare of the citys residents  and 4 therefore regulating singlefamily rental dwellings is the most effective way to reduce neighborhood and city blight with the resources available to the city so in order to address this unique situation and help to protect residents of neighborhoods surrounding singlefamily rental dwellings the city finds that a singlefamily rental dwelling inspection program is warranted and necessary   111014  scope the provisions of this article shall apply to singlefamily rental dwellings and the properties on which they are located   111014  definitions for purpose of

 1   adopted 42092 and  adopted 81897 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to help protect citizens and community members from fraudulent and unwanted harassment from peddlers and solicitors and from peddlers and solicitors having criminal backgrounds who may pose a threat to persons or property while also protecting the constitutional rights of peddlers and solicitors also with respect to certain solicitors constitutional right to free speech it is the purpose and intent of the city to narrowly tailor the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens while at the same time not unduly burdening the right of such solicitors to engage in soliciting to these ends the registration provisions of this chapter seek a minimal amount of basic information from solicitors that is tailored toward providing information that is necessary to protect against criminals entering onto the private property of residents and their families under false pretenses to assist in the investigation of complaints if received to deter at least some solicitors having a criminal or fraudulent intent from posing as solicitors in the city and to provide a reasonable method of differentiating between solicitors and peddlers in the city while it is acknowledged that some persons may still engage in fraudulent or criminal activities regardless or in disregard of the registration and licensing provisions of this chapter such provisions will enable 1 residents to identify nonregistered solicitors and unlicensed peddlers and to thereby discern between those solicitors or peddlers that they wish to engage or not engage based on whether or not they have registered their information at the city or been licensed  2 legitimate solicitors and peddlers to provide proof that they are registered or licensed with the city when engaging with residents  3 the city peddlers and solicitors to benefit from a clear differentiation between peddlers and solicitors which will assist in preventing unlicensed peddling  and 4 police officers to advise residents of safety precautions and undertakings in their dealings with solicitors and peddlers to help protect themselves from fraud or criminal activity eg by asking for a copy of their registration form as well as identify unregistered solicitors and unlicensed peddlers when complaints are received with respect to all of the foregoing the farmington hills police departments crime prevention advisory committee adopted a resolution on  identifying public safety concerns regarding unlicensed peddlers and solicitors and the need to enforce and control peddling and soliciting furthermore a study conducted by the neighboring city of farmington in 2008 and 2009 shows that the farmington public safety department issued seventyfive 75 tickets to unlicensed solicitors during that twoyear period and twentyfour 24 of those tickets were issued to persons who were arrested on outstanding warrants accordingly it was found that roughly onethird  13  of all unlicensed and unregistered peddlers and solicitors have outstanding criminal warrants in the immediate vicinity of the city of farmington hills additionally the city acknowledges that incidents of criminal and fraudulent activities in connection with doortodoor solicitation and peddling have been documented in court cases across the country some of which have even been documented in writings of the united states supreme court see for example justice rehnquists dissent in watchtower bible and tract society v village of stratton  536 us 150 at 17273 122 sct 208 153 led2d 205 2002 as such it is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish a system of licensing and registering for the different types of peddlers and solicitors defined herein and to establish certain regulations concerning the conduct of peddling and soliciting in the city of farmington hills in order to prevent fraud crime undue and unwanted annoyance and harassment and to protect the peace privacy safety health and welfare of the residents businesses and persons in the city while also respecting the constitutional rights of

provide for an alternative means for development of singlefamily areas where a parcel of land has characteristics which hinder practical development under the normal subdivision approach or where the alternative will permit better preservation of natural features also this option may permit increased densities under certain circumstances to accomplish this modifications to the onefamily

two 2 findings by the planning commission with final density dependent upon whether or not the site qualifies under both findings i first the planning commission shall find that the parcel will qualify for the cluster development option as defined in biviii development would be at the singlefamily densities permitted in subsection 34a this finding must be made in all cases ii second the planning commission may additionally find that the parcel is located in a transition area or is impacted by nonresidential uses or traffic on major or secondary thoroughfares or other similar conditions if the planning commission makes such a finding it may permit an increase in density up to the maximum densities established in subsection 34 b b the planning commission may approve the clustering or attaching of buildings on parcels of land under single ownership and control which in the opinion of the planning commission have characteristics that would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size shape or dimension or because the site is located in a transitional use area or the site has natural characteristics which are worth preserving or which make platting difficult in approving a parcel for cluster development the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist i the parcel to be developed has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is generally parallel to such thoroughfare and is of shallow depth as measured from the thoroughfare ii the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is of a narrow width as measured along the 399 1 purpose and introduction 2 definitions zoning 3 districts use 4 standards site 5 standards development 6 procedures admin and 7 enforcement farmington hills zoning i thoroughfare which makes platting difficult iii the parcel is shaped in such a way that the angles formed by its boundaries make a subdivision difficult to achieve and the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare iv a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare v a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by land that is located in other than an ra district or is developed for a use other than singlefamily homes vi the parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable vii the parcel contains natural land forms which are so arranged that the change of elevation within the site includes slopes in excess of ten 10 percent between these elevations these elevation changes and slopes shall appear as the typical feature of the site rather than the exceptional or infrequent features of the site the topography is such that achieving road grades of less than that permitted by the city would be impossible unless the site were mass graded the providing of onefamily clusters will in the opinion of the planning commission allow a greater preservation of the natural setting viii the parcel contains natural assets which would be preserved use of cluster development such assets may include natural stands of large trees land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife unusual topographic features or other natural assets which should be preserved c in order to qualify for development under subsection 34bvi vii or viii above the planning commission shall determine that the parcel has those characteristics and the request shall be supported by written andor graphic documentation prepared by a landscape architect engineer

traffic volume site design and pedestrian safety it is intended that setbacks for each dwelling shall be such that one car length space will be available between the garage or required offstreet parking spaces and the street pavement in determining the setbacks from minor residential streets the planning commission may use the following guidelines a garages or required offstreet parking spaces shall not be located less than twenty 20 feet from the rightofway of a public street unless such street or portion thereof is serving as access to not more than sixteen 16 residential units b where streets are private or the planning commission does not require the twentyfoot setback from a public rightofway garages or required offstreet parking spaces shall not be located less than twenty 20 feet from the pavement edge of the street or the shoulder of a street iii that side of a cluster adjacent to a major or secondary thoroughfare shall not be nearer to such street than twentyfive 25

following within the cluster development i singlefamily lots subject to the standards of of this chapter  ii detached buildings with setbacks as required by of this chapter for the applicable residential district  iii open or recreation space  iv changes in topography which provide an effective buffer  v a major or secondary thoroughfare  vi some other similar means of providing a
