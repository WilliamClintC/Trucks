health and sanitation article i  in general secs 3613618  reserved article ii  smoke and vapefree air regulations footnotes  1  editors note  adopted oct 2 200 amended the the addition of a new chapter 43 sections 4314314 in order to maintain the alphabetical sequence of chapter titles the provisions of said ordinance have been included herein as a new chapter 52 sections 5215213 at the discretion of the editor findings a smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that may result from the incendiary nature of such activity it has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide hydrogen cyanide nitrous oxide and formaldehyde secondhand smoke 68 percent of the total smoke produced by a cigarette affects the health of the bystander interfering with respiratory tract defenses often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative reactions and is a known cause of lung cancer b because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect material and direct on the public health safety welfare comfort and property of residents of the city it is necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places in all enclosed places of employment near entrances to all such public places and places of employment in and near openair public dining areas and within certain unenclosed public places the corporate authorities of the city adopt the findings conclusions and reports of the surgeon general of the united states regarding the effects of secondhand smoke as further support for this chapter c alternative tobacco and nicotine delivery products have recently become available to the public in the commercial market ecigarettes or vapor cigarettes are an alternative nicotine product which contains nicotine and other chemicals which are turned into a vapor or steam that is inhaled by the user and then exhaled although there is limited research on their health risks the united states food and drug administration notes that the solution used in ecigarettes contains toxic chemicals found in antifreeze and several other cancercausing chemicals such as nitrosamines d the concentration of these chemicals in ecigarettes is not definitively known  the potential harmful effects and addictiveness appear to vary based upon the brand and degree of vaporization selected by the user research illustrates that nicotine can affect brain development in children and teens the vapor emitted by ecigarettes is in aerosol form that has the capacity to deeply penetrate lung cells and the cellular lining of the organs made up of these cells e an article published in the new england journal of medicine reported a study performed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy which permitted researchers to look at vape aerosol after vaping the researchers found that the prevaping liquid breaks down into formaldehyde and that the reaction between an electronic aerosolizer propylene glycol glycerol and formaldehyde creates a formaldehydereleasing agent called formaldehyde hemiacetals which are known as industrial biocides although small amounts of formaldehyde are not dangerous higher levels are strongly associated with certain cancers according to the international agency for research on cancer making it one of 114 compounds known as carcinogens the city council adopts these findings in the new england journal of medicine as a basis to support these amendments    1022006   1052015 purpose this article shall be cited as the wheaton

of employment  within 25 feet of all public entrances to such places  in openair public dining areas and within 25 feet of such areas  and within certain unenclosed public places in order to ensure

existing transmission towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicants engineering requirements c existing transmission towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicants proposed antenna and related equipment d the applicants proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing transmission towers or structures or the antenna on the existing transmission towers or structures would cause interference with the applicants proposed antenna e the fees costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing transmission tower or structure or to adapt an existing transmission tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable costs exceeding new transmission tower development are presumed to be unreasonable 167 f the applicants demonstration that there are other limiting factors that render existing transmission towers and structures unsuitable 5 setbacks and

whichever is greater b transmission towers and accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements c transmission towers over fifty 50 feet in height shall not be located within onequarter  of a mile from any existing transmission tower that is over fifty 50 feet in height to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of personal wireless service facilities installing personal wireless service facilities with the demonstrated ability for colocation of antennas by more than one personal wireless service carrier on an existing or new transmission tower  andor technical evidence acceptable to the director of planning & economic development concluding no other site or latest technology could be used to provide the intended services and denial of the proposed site would create a gap in providing services to the residents of the city shall eliminate the separation requirement 6 landscaping the following
