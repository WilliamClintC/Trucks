known as the stormwater management and erosion and sediment control law  272 introduction  purpose a landdisturbance activities and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpointsource pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites b during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitats for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the village of brockport improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow regulation of landdisturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the village of brockport it seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives 1 meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the spdes general permit for stormwater discharges
