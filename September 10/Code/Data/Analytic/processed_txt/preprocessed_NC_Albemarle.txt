traffic impact study tis be performed to determine the effect of a proposed development zoning change or special use approval on the adjacent transportation system bthese guidelines and requirements have been developed to provide for a uniform and consistent approach in the preparation of tis and to establish report requirements to facilitate the review process these guidelines and requirements are intended to address several purposes cthese include 1 establishing analysis methodologies and reporting formats  2 identifying traffic impacts caused by the proposed development  3 determining the site access and offsite infrastructure improvements necessary to accommodate the proposed development  4 providing the city with an opportunity to provide input on the number and location of site access points internal site circulation and truck and service vehicle access and circulation  5 providing public agencies and officials a comprehensive study that clearly and concisely evaluates and documents the traffic impacts of landuse decisions  6 facilitating the identification and negotiation of mitigation requirements and the funding and time of implementation required to accommodate the development or mitigate its impacts 2athe guidelines and report requirements that follow are based on similar information published by the institute of transportation engineers and other sources the guidelines depart from those sources by providing additional details concerning information needed and methodologies to be used to meet the requirements of the city ba traffic impact study mayshall be required in the following situations 1where a potential development generates 100 or more trips during the roadway or development peak hour  2where a potential development generates 500 daily trips  3where expansion of an existing development creates additional trips totaling either of the two previous requirements  4where a development proposal requires rezoning or a special use permit  5where there are potential safety or capacity deficiencies including a high accident locations confusing intersections and intersections where a traffic signal or other changes in traffic control device may be warranted  b locations where current or projected roadway or intersection levels of service will be significantly affected by the proposed development  c where the adjacent roadway system lacks the capacity to accommodate increased traffic  d where roadway improvements necessary to accommodate the development may not be feasible  e where vertical andor horizontal curves and other conditions may affect the development form being accommodated 3athe decision regarding the need for and contents of an impact study can be appealed in writing to the city manager within ten days of the date of the

2before the watershed review board may grant a variance it shall make the following three findings which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based athere are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the chapter in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the five following conditions exist 1if he complies with the provisions of the chapter the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of his property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting an variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of his property 2the hardship results from the application of the chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship 3the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property 4the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the chapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of the chapter and then comes to the board for relief 5the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice bthe variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and preserves its spirit cin the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare 3in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter if a variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan 4the watershed review board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application 5a variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision 6aif the application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the watershed review board decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include 1the variance application  2the hearing notices  3the evidence presented  4motions offers of proof objections to evidence and rulings on them  5proposed findings and exceptions  6the proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit bthe preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental management commission for its review as follows 1if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from nor make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted and the variance if granted will not result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations the commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the watershed review board if the commission approves the variance as proposed the board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance if the commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations the board shall prepare a final decision including such conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance 2if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without the variance or the variance if granted will result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed
