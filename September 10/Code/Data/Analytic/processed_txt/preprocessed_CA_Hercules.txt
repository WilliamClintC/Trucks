find that a according to the 2010 us surgeon generals report how tobacco smoke causes disease even occasional exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful and low levels of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke lead to a rapid and sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke b according to the 2014 us surgeon generals report the health consequences of smoking50 years of progress secondhand smoke exposure causes stroke in nonsmokers the report also found that since the 1964 surgeon generals report on smoking and health two million five hundred thousand 2500000 nonsmokers have died from diseases caused by tobacco smoke c numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the national cancer institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately fiftythree thousand 53000 americans annually d based on a finding by the california environmental protection agency in 200 the california air resources board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects including low birthweight babies  sudden infant death syndrome sids  increased respiratory infections in children  asthma in children and adults  lung cancer sinus cancer and breast cancer in younger premenopausal women  heart disease  and death e a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer a twentyfive percent 25% to fifty percent 50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function f during periods of active smoking peak and average outdoor tobacco smoke ots levels measured in outdoor cafes and restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor tobacco smoke concentrations nonsmokers who spend six 6 hour periods in outdoor smoking sections of bars and restaurants experience a significant increase in levels of cotinine when compared to the cotinine levels in a smokefree outdoor area g the dangers of residual tobacco contamination are present in hotels even in nonsmoking rooms compared with hotels that are completely smokefree surface nicotine and smoke are elevated in nonsmoking rooms of hotels that allow smoking hallway surfaces outside of smoking rooms also show higher levels of nicotine than those outside of nonsmoking rooms partial smoking restrictions in hotels do not protect nonsmoking guests from exposure to tobacco smoke and tobaccospecific carcinogens h unregulated hightech smoking devices commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat electronic ignition system electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products the world health organization who recommends that electronic smoking devices not be used indoors especially in smokefree environments in order to minimize the risk to bystanders of breathing in the aerosol emitted by the devices and to avoid undermining the enforcement of smokefree laws i hookah smoke exposes users to many of the same toxicants found in cigarette smoke j the society of actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the us economy roughly ten billion dollars $10000000000 a year five billion dollars $5000000000 in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and four billion six hundred million dollars $4600000000 in lost productivity k numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree l creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health

part 1989 formerly 10 appeals and variance procedure nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of hercules city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2009 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  providing that the procedures of articles 4 and 5 of this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of hercules city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of hercules city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the contra costa recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  part 2009 div 1 part 1989 formerly 10 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city of hercules city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards

susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  and 4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  and 5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  and 6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  and 7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  and 8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan

sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  and 2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections a d of this satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this the city of hercules city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems

facilities which serve the existing population will become overburdened if also required to serve all new development c the general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the city and places limits on the intensity and density of such use the city council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual and projected development of property within the city based upon this examination the city council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the city council to project with substantial certainty the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the citys general plan d based upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan a substantial amount of residential development will occur in the city before the city is fully built out e this anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase in the demand for park and recreation facilities new development will thus create an additional burden on the existing facilities and the need for new and expanded facilities f if additional park and recreation facilities are not provided as development occurs the existing facilities will not be adequate to serve the community this could result in adverse impacts such as overcrowding and overuse of the present park and recreation facilities injuries related to park and recreation facility use lack of facilities for youth activities and lack of facilities or space for community groups and gatherings this shortage of park and recreation facilities would lead to a deterioration of the public services which the residents in hercules now enjoy g to prevent these undesirable consequences the capacity of the citys park and recreation facilities must be built at a rate which would accommodate the expected growth in the city h there is limited land suitable for the development of park and recreation facilities the city will need to acquire and develop land parcels which are practicably available to satisfy the parks and recreation needs of future residents i the park and recreation system is a citywide system providing recreation opportunities to the entire community j although the demand for public services generated by an individual development project may not be in and of itself sufficient to overload the citys existing park facilities the unmitigated cumulative impact of all new development would result in an unacceptable burden k it is the policy of the city that new development pay for the cost of new parks and recreation facilities and improvements to existing parks and recreation facilities which are necessary to accommodate the demands generated by new development in the absence of a park and recreation facilities fee existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the improvements which are necessary to avoid an unacceptable deterioration of

facilities identifies the standards for development of parks and recreation facilities the estimated demand for new facilities in the future and the proportion of that future demand which will be generated by new development the city council finds that these facts and that study represent a reasonable estimate of the needed facilities and costs thereof n a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required park and recreation facilities is to impose a park and recreation facilities fee based on the extent to which new development generates demand for additional park and recreation facilities o the comprehensive impact fee study identifies the amount of park land and type and cost of park and recreation facilities for that land necessary to accommodate future growth p the park and recreation facilities that will be constructed with funds generated by the park and recreation facilities impact fee will significantly benefit the community in that the adverse impacts and inconvenience which would otherwise be caused by a declining level of public parks and recreation facilities will be substantially mitigated persons who undertake new development in the city are benefitted by a desirable community and the citys reputation for providing and ability to provide a variety of wellrun public services including park and recreation

development b each type of residential development shall contribute to the needed park facilities in proportion to the average number of residents for the particular type of dwelling unit c the amount of the fee is calculated based upon the need for park facilities once development occurs and the per person cost for those facilities r periodic review and possible revision of the fee resolution adopted by the city council under this allow for the adjustment of the fee to ensure that the fee remains a fair and equitable method for the distribution of costs to construct park and recreation

increasing regional growth significant residential commercial and industrial development is expected to occur within the city b the general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the city places limits on the intensity and density of such use and includes policies to improve the safety of roadway facilities and to provide for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure the city council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual development of property within the city based upon this examination the city council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the council to project with substantial certainty the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the citys general plan c based upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan a substantial amount of residential commercial and industrial development will occur in the city before the city is fully built out d new development in hercules will increase the demand for all modes of travel including walking biking transit automobile and truckgoods movement and thus will increase the need for improvement to transportation facilities including but not limited to vehicular transit bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and improvements this anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase over existing levels of vehicular traffic and transit bicycle and pedestrian travel this increase in multimodal travel will result in traffic volumes which exceed the capacity of the existing citywide circulation system to provide acceptable levels of service and safe transportation facilities new development within the city will thus create an additional burden on the existing transportation facilities e if additional trafficrelated as well as transit bicycle and pedestrian transportation facilities are not added as development occurs the existing transportation facilities will not be adequate to serve the community consistent with the general plan this could result in adverse impacts such unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and at intersections traffic accidents air pollution noise and restricted access for emergency vehicles this would lead to a deterioration of the level of service for vehicles and deterioration of other transportation facilities such as transit bicycle and pedestrian facilities which the residents employees and property owners in hercules now enjoy f to prevent these undesirable consequences the capacity of the citywide transportation facilities must be built at a rate which will accommodate the expected growth in the city g although the traffic volume generated by an individual development project may not be in and of itself sufficient to overload the existing citywide transportation facilities the cumulative impact of all new development including development currently approved or submitted for approval will result in unacceptable levels of traffic congestion h it is the policy of the city that new development pay for the cost of improvements to the citywide circulation system which are necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development in the absence of this a traffic facilities fee existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the transportation facilities which are necessary to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and the related adverse impacts i all types of urban development require and use transportation facilities the city council also has examined the rates at which different land uses generate traffic the city council in evaluating these traffic generation rates has taken into consideration among other things other trafficrelated studies and reports prepared by or on behalf of the city the city council finds that these traffic generation rates represent a reasonable estimate of the actual impact on the citys circulation system j a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required improvements to the transportation facilities is to impose a transportation impact fee based on the extent to which new development generates additional traffic volumes and impacts to the transportation facilities k the 2019 hercules transportation impact fee nexus study specifically identifies transportation facility improvements which are necessary to accommodate future growth these improvements are and will be incorporated in the citys capital improvement program cip l the circulation system improvements that will be constructed with funds generated pursuant to the article will significantly benefit the contributor in that

typical density the goal of the typical density is to achieve an overall growth target set by the city in its general plan however the density of a property is allowed to vary within the range according to factors such as topography economic neighborhood compatibility provision of affordable housing market conditions and the capability of a proposed development to further specific goals policies and standards of the general plan in some cases property development regulations may vary or be determined approval of a planned development plan in these cases the property regulations

standards for new land uses established in land use compatibility for community exterior noise environments shown in table 6 shall be modified by the following 1 the maximum acceptable noise levels in residential areas is a ldn of 60 dba this level shall guide the design and location of future development and is a goal for the reduction of noise in existing development a 60 dba ldn goal will be applied where outdoor use is a major consideration eg backyards in singlefamily housing developments and recreation areas in multifamily housing projects the outdoor standard will not normally be applied to small decks associated with apartments and condominiums but these will be evaluated on a casebycase basis where the city determines that providing a ldn of 60 dba or lower cannot be achieved after the application of feasible mitigations a ldn of 65 dba may be permitted at the small decks at the discretion of the city council 2 indoor noise level shall not exceed a ldn of 45 dba in new housing units if the noise source is a railroad then the outdoor noise exposure criterion should be 70 dba ldn for future development 3 noise levels in new residential development exposed to an exterior ldn of 60 dba or greater shall be limited to a maximum instantaneous noise level in bedrooms of 50 dba maximum instantaneous noise levels in all other habitable rooms should not exceed 55 dba the typical repetitive maximum instantaneous noise level at each site would be determined by noise monitoring examples would include truck passbys on busy streets train passbys and train warning whistles 4 appropriate interior noise levels in commercial industrial and office buildings are a function of the use of space and shall be evaluated on a casebycase basis interior noise levels in offices generally should be maintained at 45 dba leq hourly average or less 5 for nontransportation related noise sources outdoor noise levels within a residential property should not exceed the limits in table 76 of the noise element of the general plan interior noise levels shall be 15 decibels lower than those shown in table 7 b new nonresidential land development projects shall meet

set forth in table 7 of the noise element of the general plan as measured at any affected residential land use d control the level of noise at noisesensitive land uses generated by construction activities of the following measures 1 for construction near noisesensitive areas as determined by the community development department require that noisy construction activities including truck traffic be scheduled for periods according to construction permit to limit impact on adjacent residents or other sensitive receptors 2 require a construction schedule that minimizes potential cumulative construction noise impacts and accommodates particularly noisesensitive periods for nearby land uses eg for schools churches etc 3 where feasible require that holes for driven piles be predrilled to reduce the level and duration of noise impacts 4 where feasible construct temporary solid noise barriers between source and sensitive receptors to reduce offsite propagation of construction noise this measure could reduce construction noise by up to 5 decibels 5 require internal combustion engines used for construction purposes to be equipped with a properly operating muffler of a type recommended by the manufacturer also require impact tools to be shielded per manufacturers specifications e noise attenuation techniques where noise levels exceed community noise standards for a proposed land use 1 or more of the following techniques may be required to reduce the noise to acceptable level 1 proper site planning to reduce noise impacts should be investigated for a project by taking advantage of the natural shape and contours of the site it is often possible to arrange the buildings and other uses in a manner which will reduce and possibly eliminate noise impact site planning techniques include a increasing the distance between the noise sources and the receiver b placing nonnoise sensitive structures such as parking lots maintenance facilities and utility areas between the source and the receiver c using nonnoise sensitive structures such as garages to shield noisesensitive areas d orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise source 2 architectural layout in many cases noise reduction requirements can be met by giving attention to layout of noisesensitive spaces bedrooms for example will be considerably quieter if placed on the side of the house facing away from the freeway similarly balconies facing freeways should be avoided quiet outdoor spaces can be provided next to a noisy highway by creating a ushaped development which faces away from the highway 3 noise barriers to be effective a noise barrier must be massive enough to prevent significant noise transmission high enough to shield the receiver from the noise source the minimum acceptable surface weight for a noise barrier is 4 lbssq feet  equivalent to 34inch plywood and the barrier must be carefully constructed so that there are no cracks or openings to be effective a barrier must interrupt the lineofsight between the noise source and the receiver 12 odor no use except within the i industrial district and the pqpc publicquasipubliccity
