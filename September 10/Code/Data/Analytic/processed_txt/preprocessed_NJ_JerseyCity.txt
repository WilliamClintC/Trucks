recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records

amended 6232004 by   6272007 by   1252012 by   1571  purpose and official comments a purpose  official comments 1 the city of jersey city has repeatedly experienced serious civil disturbances and other occurrences detrimental to the publics safety health and welfare associated with entertainment and dance venues these problems include but are not limited to riots disorderly groups public consumption of alcohol and public urination consequently this chapter is enacted to license and regulate these activities except those directly sponsored and selfregulated by the city itself 2 social clubs are expressly regulated by this chapter because recent experience has shown that attempts have been made to circumvent the general regulatory process for example forprofit nightclubs have reorganized as private membership clubs to circumvent the alcoholic beverage law  editors note see njsa 1 et seq 3 this chapter also prohibits obscene entertainment and obscene dancing and contains a definition of obscenity and pornography that reflects contemporary community standards as enforceable by relevant judicial decisions it also explicitly incorporates by reference the prohibitions on pornography and obscenity found in of the municipal enacting this prohibition the city council relied on extensive evidence of longstanding communitys standards testimony was taken from ordinary citizens as well as members of the clergy teachers business people and professionals the council issued legislative findings that the people of jersey city are offended by obscenity and pornography a jersey city seeks to maintain an atmosphere as conducive as possible to families in a densely populated urban setting b obscenity and pornography have had no place in the public life of jersey city historically no socalled adult bookstores or adult theaters have operated here in addition no erotic dancing venues have ever been allowed to operate here in the city notwithstanding their presence in adjacent communities therefore these legislative findings support the existence of community standards that allow for the constitutional circumscription of such activity and the city will continue to enforce these social norms sanctions 4 the director of the division of commerce is given primary jurisdiction over this chapter however given the public safety concerns the director of public safety

unrelated to their intended use according to reports from the department of public safety board of education and the media the purchase of box cutters by juveniles is increasing and box cutters have

juvenile violence although the council recognizes that these devices can be acquired outside the city of jersey city it believes nevertheless that it should not be made easy to acquire them within the

of jersey city and is therefore a necessary focus of any effort to reduce the amount of waste and the economic and environmental costs of waste management b discarded nondegradable packaging and plastic contained within the waste stream of the city of jersey city is considered a fundamental cause of problems associated with municipal waste disposal and litter c disposal space is diminishing rapidly  solid waste receiving areas outside of the hudson county area are becoming increasingly uncertain and expensive  for both economic and environmental reasons measures to simplify the chemical complexity of solid waste and thereby streamline solid waste management must be vigorously pursued d the chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing public policy that is intended to improve the management and disposal of solid waste reduce the cumulative impact of litter encourage composting and other forms of recycling minimize the potential for toxic substances to form if solid waste is burned reduce the volume of ash byproducts that may be created by any burning of waste plastic packaging and otherwise anticipate environmental problems that may be caused by the municipal solid waste disposal program e the use of plastic nondegradable packaging has become widespread throughout the city of jersey city and the resulting mixed substance waste stream is a serious impediment to many solid waste management programs being considered for the city f the widespread use of plastics especially polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride pose a threat to the environment by causing unnecessary taking of landfill space or when incinerated by the possible introduction of toxic byproducts into the atmosphere g the economic and environmental problems associated with a mixed substance waste stream are so severe that a program to modify the composition of solid waste thereby reducing environmental hazards and toxicity associated with solid waste incineration and encouraging the composting of putrescible biodegradable wastes and encouraging other forms of recycling of solid waste substances is hereby determined to be a policy goal of the city of jersey city h the waste stream within jersey city is so large and diverse that any program to establish policies and laws conducive to any waste management program in lieu of landfilling must identify and set new policy for those specific sources of waste packaging which originate with this city i certain retail establishments within jersey city are points of origin for a significant volume of packaging waste and therefore are particularly susceptible to actions which have significant potential for simplifying the composition of this portion of jersey citys solid waste stream thereby improving solid waste management within this city j the use of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride for food packaging is problematic because neither of these plastics are readily recyclable  their abundant commercial use in lieu of other plastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene unnecessarily complicates the overall chemical composition of municipal waste and subtracts from the possible emergence of a viable plastic recycling market  if burned together polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride leave a relatively heavier and more expensive ash residue to dispose of which may also create dioxin hydrochloric acid or other toxic chemicals that could be emitted into the general environment once burned in a resource recovery facility k there are readily available plastic andor paper product substitutes for most of the polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride retail food packaging now being used in the city of jersey city the use of which alternatives would be environmentally and economically advantageous to the public of the city of jersey city l plastic bags in the waste stream constitute an impediment to the development of efficient waste separation recycling or other waste management programs and are less desirable than paper bags because plastic bags are neither recyclable nor compostable m plastic bags used by retail

mixeduse buildings and the construction of new residential and mixeduse buildings on vacant and underutilized land while incorporating much needed public open space for district residents and the surrounding community ancillary commercial facilities are also encouraged to serve the surrounding community 2 the mword shall apply as an overlay district which means that it applies as alternative zoning regulations when and if chosen by the property owner property owners within the mword may also continue to maintain uses of the property that were permitted at the time of the adoption of this

include the reopening of previously vacated streets such as dey street andor the creation of new public streets and rightsofway to accommodate the new residential and commercial reuse of property within the mword it is specifically anticipated that new street connections will be necessary from the western end of dey street to both saint pauls avenue and newark avenue the location of new streets and rightsofway should be located so as not to destroy existing or modified structures within the district the intent of requiring these new andor reopened streets is to extend the street pattern into the district in order to better integrate the district into the surrounding street grid and urban fabric of the community and to better disperse traffic from new developments 3 because of the nature and scale of the existing industrial buildings within the mword the conversion from industrial to residential and mixeduse land uses may occur in a phased fashion wherein a portion of a

larger industrial structures were designed as a series of bays consisting of a repetition of building units along the streetscape broken up by recessed areas or voids intended to bring air and light to inner portions of the building these voids shall not be filled in 2 materials it is preferable to repair rather than replace materials on the facades of the buildings however if materials must be replaced they must be carefully selected to match the appearance of existing materials to the greatest extent practical 3 windows windows are a major component of a buildings appearance therefore all windows that are visible along street facades must be treated in a manner that are consistent with the architectural character of the building such window openings must not be reduced or modified although it is recognized that replacement windows must conform to contemporary standards for energy efficiency  replacement windows must be selected to be compatible with the character of the existing windows including muntins and mullions and the architectural style and character of the building being renovated 4 entrances care must be taken in locating new entrances into the buildings to accommodate the reuse of these structures all buildings must relate to the streetscape and orient their primary entrance to the public rightofway pedestrian access points shall be located on less trafficked streets and designed in manner that relates to the adjoining street and encourages pedestrian activity along the street conversely vehicular access points shall be located and designed to limit their impact on the pedestrian environment and to the appearance of the building 5 roofscape many older industrial buildings contained skylights water towers and other rooftop appurtenances that add to the architectural style and character of the structure these features shall be retained and incorporated into the design and reuse of the structure new necessary mechanical equipment and rooftop appurtenances may be located on the roof but shall be screened andor incorporated into the roofscape design 6 other design features many older industrial structures contained unique features such as tall smoke stacks which became familiar features in the landscape these features shall be retained and incorporated into the design of the building however other smaller or minor buildings or minor portions of buildings which may have been accessory to the previous use but are no longer appropriate to the new reuse  may be removed 7 additionsexpansions new additionsexpansions of existing structures must be done in a manner that is complimentary to the existing buildings design and architecture in term of size scale materials etc however new additions should not seek to copy the existing building as each building is a product of its own time additional floors may be added to the top of existing buildings provided that such construction is not contrary to the intent of paragraph g 5 above and is in compliance with the height requirements of paragraph d 11 of this section 8 new construction new buildings constructed as part of the reuse andor redevelopment of industrial sites either as accessory to the new reuse or as infill buildings must be designed to compliment the architecture of the existing major buildings on the site it is recognized that each

the parking structure facade shall be of the punched style these openings shall be consistent with the rhythm of the window openings serving the principal uses within the building they shall be covered by glass or metal in such a way that the exterior design is compatible with the design of the building and the actual windows of the building the glass tint andor reflectivity may be different so as to decrease the visibility of the garage use within in lieu of glass the openings may be covered by a hinged solid metal plateshutter or recessed decorative grill over a louvered opening as described below blind windows where appropriate shall also be permitted where louvers are needed or proposed decorative grills shall be installed over functional louvers or other comparable decorative material shall be used in openings or portions of the openings resembling the windows provided above andor below parking levels the intent of the above regulations is that no exposed garage exterior
