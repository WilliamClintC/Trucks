service charges footnotes  5  charter reference sewer service charges  77 wastewater rates and charges this section establishes rates and charges for collecting and treating customer wastewater a the following rates and charges are hereby established and defined as follows 1 minimum charge a fixed charge that recovers the cost of customer billing and includes an allotment of wastewater disposal this charge is calculated by including all applicable labor material supplies equipment and overhead this charge is the same for all customers the included allotment of wastewater disposal is the minimum amount for which a customer is billed regardless of whether or not the wastewater is disposed 2 volumetric consumption rate this is a charge per unit of customer wastewater disposal typically a customers estimated volume of wastewater disposal is based upon each 1000 gallons of water consumed it is variable in that the amount the customer pays varies with the amount of water consumed by the customer this charge applies to wastewater disposal above any allotted minimum this charge is calculated by including all applicable labor material supplies equipment and overhead 3 residential unmetered service a fixed charge that applies where no individual water meter is installed this charge is calculated using a fair and reasonable volume of wastewater disposal such as an average and consideration of applicable residential wastewater rates and charges b the cost of installing reading repairing and replacing wastewater meters is prohibitively expensive accordingly customers estimated volume of wastewater disposal is commonly based upon each 1000 gallons of water consumed large industrial customers and very large commercial customers such as commercial laundries who experience high evaporative water loss in their manufacturing and process operations may install wastewater volume meters at their expense also at the customers expense periodic meter calibration is required as well as meter repair and replacement in these instances the wastewater volume meter will be read by the town and customer wastewater disposal volume shall be based upon the meter reading
