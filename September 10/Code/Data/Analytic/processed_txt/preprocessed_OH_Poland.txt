srnec        linda m srnec clerktreasurer editors note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised exceptions are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position

printable version of this map in pdf format click_here appendix ii design criteria for the village of poland ohio 1it is the intention of the design review board to place the greatest possible emphasis on the further development of a village as distinct from a suburb a village gives equal opportunity to pedestrian and motorist alike the heart of every village is its commercial and business area with buildings close to the street easily rubbing elbows with one other and where adults and children walk comfortably from one building to the other poland has the potential to offer a village center unique in the youngstown area it is the firm conviction of the design review board that poland can reverse her recent commercial suburban sprawl by insisting on a well defined village streetscape where building character building placement and building access are the main elements of design areas of coverage these criteria are designed to reflect the visual character of all of the village of poland ohio  however they are specifically intended to apply to only three specific areas when used in the formal considerations of the design review board of the village of poland 1all new construction exterior changes relocations or demolitions of any building structure or part thereof warranting a building permit excluding all singlefamily dwellings not in a village preservation district or a designated village landmark 2the relationship of pedestrian and vehicular access and general site planning among existing and proposed construction in all areas excluding singlefamily dwellings 3design of signage requiring a permit use of the criteria for each design submitted to the design review board the applicant shall show how his or her design responds to all points in each of the following applicable criteria all designs must comply with general design features and in addition each design must comply with v andor vi as applicable depending upon the use and location of the design general design features it is not the intent of these criteria to prevent planners architects landscape architects and other designers from expressing and exploring new ideas iii1new design should express its own time and solve its own contemporary functional problems while maintaining a harmony of materials and proportion and scale with earlier building character and styles of poland iii2in the case of a new building the designer should seek a unity and coherence with the dignity and prevailing character of a neighborhood iii3in the case of remodeling or enlargement of an existing building the designer should seek a unity and coherence with the dignity and character of the present structure design defects cause substantial deterioration of the architectural character of a neighborhood and property devaluation iii4new design shall avoid arresting and spectacular effects violent contrast of materials and colors and a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance iii5new design shall maintain the local taste for simplicity of materials using only one principal exterior material no more than one or two window sizes and a few simple decorative details  never a smorgasbord of materials or decorative detailing iii6poland buildings define the edges of the public street therefore only buildings not parking should be on the street edge parking should be confined to the rear of the building the main facade and main entrance should face the street and be a social part of the public sidewalk and street edge commercial design intentto assist developers and guide building and site design in the commercial area so that a cohesive active and pleasant shopping service and business area will be strengthened and grow in the center of poland village for a comparative value the better model of site planning and general building design is the south main street commercial area in this part of the village the commercial area changes slowly and comfortably into a residential area this area has particularly noteworthy features which should be retained reinforced and repeated iv1maintain the occasional old commercial buildings and use the smaller scale and tall proportions of the 19th and early 20th century buildings iv2continue the proximity to the street and evenness of setback from the street iv3include shade trees and shrubbery planting that relieves the hardness of concrete and asphalt in all designs iv4include the option to walk and bicycle as well as drive to a store other equally important building and site features are the following iv5do not transplant building designs from other obvious historic or geographic areas not consistent with the design character of poland eg american western frontier buildings iv6proportion of height to width and depth  images00026jpg  most old commercial buildings in poland are tall and narrow to the street when more space is needed additions are made  but the building is not just made bigger by increasing all of its dimensions iv7rhythm of bays andor variations in the planes of the facade  images00028jpg  many buildings have regularly spaced windows and doors that divide a facade of the building equally into regular repeated bays  images00030jpg  on many other poland buildings particularly late 19th and 20th century buildings the structure is not a perfect rectangle with flat facades but each facade pushes out with additions bay windows porches etc allowing for varied window placement and adding great variety to each facade  images00032jpg  in particularly large buildings there are regular bay divisions and variations in the planes of the facade to help break up the large mass of the building iv8interrelation of design and materials of all visible facades  images00034jpg  no old poland buildings have one fancy public facade and the rest plain and characterless or even windowless windows materials and details continue on the sides and back as well as the front when any of these facades are intended to be seen iv9rhythm of built to unbuilt space  images00036jpg  in the older parts of the commercial area buildings are regularly spaced along the street with narrow pedestrian or vehicular access between buildings iv10focus the focus of the commercial area of poland village center is the 170224 intersection it needs imposing buildings to organize and focus the towns commercial activity iv11separate parking and the pedestrian parking and pedestrian access should be designed for the safety of the pedestrian many neighboring buildings should be accessible from the same parking area a pedestrian can walk from one end of the commercial area to the other pleasantly and easily iv12public places the commercial area should have public landscaped places free from vehicles and easily accessible from several commercial structures these places should add to the character and pleasure of using the commercial area giving relief from the harshness of asphalt and concrete residential construction covered by this ordinance intentto assist architects and builders to provide new housing for poland that continues and maintains the small town visual character of poland reinforcing but also extending those design features that make the village a cohesive unit visually appealing and pleasant to be in new residential building and site designs should be compared to and interrelate with neighboring structures in the same block or area where no consistency in examples exists and few neighboring structures are relevant for comparison but the new construction will be visible from public ways comparative buildings should be drawn from another neighborhood of poland village with obvious cohesive character the following general design features should be incorporated in new residential construction v1the building as a volume  images00038jpg  poland buildings are not facades along a street but volumes on a site seen from three or even four sides  therefore all the facades of the building should interrelate and contain similar design features v2bulk  images00040jpg  poland residential buildings are composed of volumes added together to make bigger houses there seldom is a building with a dimension exceeding 45 the bigger the building the more rambling it becomes rather than just having larger dimensions v3solid to void  images00042jpg  in most residential buildings in poland neither the windows and doors nor the solid wall space dominates the appearance of the facade v4roof proportions  images00044jpg  in most poland neighborhoods there is a distinct proportion that exists between roofs and building mass a few neighborhoods are characterized by a complete lack of consistency in roof proportions or styles of roofs v5bays vs planes  images00046jpg  poland houses are usually of two types those with similar windows in each facade evenly spaced across each facade in a regular rhythmic pattern  or those with windows that vary in size but each facade of the building juts and recedes giving varied wall space to each kind of window village preservation districts and village landmarks intent to encourage interest in and preservation of the old buildings and neighborhoods of poland the social historical educational and architectural value of these buildings makes them worthy of special care to ensure their continuance of polands character and selfimage therefore owners of these properties should take every precaution to protect preserve and maintain their buildings 25where documentation exists the earliest or most historic precedent shall be followed in the use of materials window size and placement doorway placement roof style building bulk and the relation of additions or ells signage and outbuilding design and other features that add significantly to the character of the site and the building on it passed 91978 appendix iii elements of polands historic architectural and site character the following discussion elaborates the most characteristic features of polands older architecture site planning and street character so that developers designers and property owners will understand the separate elements that go together to make the built character of polands oldest neighborhoods construction and site development dating after 1930 have not been included elements have been arranged in decreasing order of importance maintenance should preserve historic elements  repair should make every attempt to duplicate worn out historic material new construction and development should fit in with existing character but never slavishly imitate or mock earlier buildings mass each poland building is seen as a threedimensional volume on its site there are five general forms of these buildings ridge to the street narrow facade to the street t square and bungaloid ridge to the street this is the earliest form of building stone tavern it continued in use nineteenth century for both commercial and residential buildings it regained really stylish popularity late in the nineteenth century and early in the twentieth century with renewed interest in colonial architecture examples 214 s main street 441 s main street 14 n main street  images00048jpg  narrow facade to the street this form was most popular in stylish houses and commercial buildings of the late federal and greek revival period when a gabled roof was used in the 18501880 period most often a hip or mansard roof was used the doorway is nearly always to one side examples 70 n main street 307 s main street  images00050jpg  t plan this form where the wing is of equal height and visual importance as the main structure is most seen in farmhouses built from the 1860s to the early twentieth century examples 9 e mckinley way 7 water street 725 n main street  images00052jpg  square these houses usually important residences of the second half of the nineteenth century have facades wider than they are tall or square facades they usually have center doorways and hip or mansard roofs examples 4 riverside 24 college st  images00054jpg  bungaloid these houses of the twentieth century have a low huddled appearance with a onestory main facade and dormered windows they are somewhat square in plan examples 22 water street 59 poland manor  images00056jpg  stories all old poland buildings are one and onehalf or two stories high often among more stylish buildings ceilings are over eight feet even as much as ten and onehalf feet giving buildings a very tall appearance except for the contemporary methodist church poland is notable for having no buildings whose roof lines act as landmarks for persons approaching poland poland has no other steeples watertowers belfries etc roof form nearly all poland roofs are pitched at least to the mid nineteenth century sawn wooden shingles were used on most roofs never shakes with better transportation and new manufacturing processes after the middle of the nineteenth century slate shingles and tincoated iron with crimped seams were also used poland buildings show much of their character in the specific details of roof construction as those illustrated below  images00058jpg  exterior materials most poland buildings are covered with wooden lap siding showing from four and onehalf inches to six inches to the weather some structures have flush board siding which occasionally is beaded usually it is under a porch although it also is used on the entire main facade of some very stylish buildings during the late nineteenth century drop or ship lapsiding was often used  it gave an appearance of very small exposure as visually important as the exposure of the siding are the corner boards which were used on all wooden old poland buildings if wood siding is properly maintained and painted every five to ten years it will last well over one hundred years  images00060jpg  brick was used on polands most pretentious buildings most brickwork prior to the 1860s employed locally made red brick laid in american common bond using soft lime mortar later commercially made brick became available wood construction was never mixed with brick construction except for small details such as doors and windows or for a rear kitchen wing little or no fancy brick work eg quoining was ever employed in polands brick buildings brick walls if properly protected regularly repointed with compatible mortar and kept clean will last well over one hundred years repointing old soft brick with modern hard mortar will eventually destroy the brick wall  images00062jpg  poland only has one building with stone work   the historically important and architecturally unique stone tavern which has coursed and uncoursed rubble sandstone endwalls aluminum and vinyl siding with its small corner pieces and overlapping end joints covers important architectural details such as entablatures door and window casings corner boards etc further a reason for initial application of aluminum or vinyl siding water damage within walls and siding may be accelerated by the siding because of its watersealing properties aluminum siding also dents dulls and does not paint well vinyl siding burns faster than wood producing poisonous fumes doorways for most poland buildings decorative detail is limited to the doorway or front porch doorways tend to be simple bold and rectilinear although some houses do have rounded and elliptical fan lights and elaborate detailing post1860 houses usually have plain doorways with decorative emphasis dependent on the front porch typical doorway styles are illustrated below  images00064jpg  windows on nearly all poland buildings windows are the same size on all sides of a building  fenestration is regular on houses built prior to the 1860s windows are placed far enough from the corner to not interfere with the structural cornerbraces the windows of an ell may be smaller than those of the main structure some commercial buildings have large display windows along the street facade  images00066jpg  window size originally was determined by the size of available panes of glass as glass production improved pane sizes increased and window sizes could increase also both the size of the window pane and the size and proportion of the whole window are critical to the character of a building the windows of old poland buildings usually have simple exterior casings about four and onehalf inches to six inches wide with a casing molding and drip cap the muntin bars of early windows were painted white or the same light color as the building usually white late in the nineteenth century muntin bars were painted a dark color so the whole window looked like one pane of glass foundations most nineteenth century poland buildings have local sandstone foundations about twentyfour inches tall the most distinguished buildings have fancy dressed ashlar foundations with the introduction of tile and block foundation material after the turn of the century foundation heights became lower foundations were exposed until the 1950s when dense usually evergreen foundation planting became popular foundations need periodic maintenance if stone or block foundations are kept properly pointed and clean free from water and plumb they will last well over one hundred years  images00068jpg  1example  village hall2 example  121 s main street porches poland houses built between 1860 and 1910 depend on large front porches for the focal decorative detail poland is unusual for having small wooden porches at the front doorway of many greek revival buildings as the kirtlandhine house  images00070jpg  1 example 114 e mckinley way2 examples 320 n main st 500 s main st porches need careful maintenance as they are more exposed to weathering than most other parts of a building whether they are embellished with railings brackets columns or balustrades both kinds usually are the central design element of a building front steps because foundations are so tall front steps are visually important a stoop is no wider than the doorway all originally were wooden or sandstone brick steps appear to be an early twentieth century style from the colonial revival movement concrete steps are of course modern color building color is remarkably important to the character of a building especially considering how easily it can be changed in the 1840s henry howe noted that most poland houses were white greek revival buildings almost always were white in the 1850s attitudes changed and white became the most unpopular color for a building instead houses had two three or four colors all earth tones that were used to pick out architectural details with the colonial revival movement early in this century white again gained popularity as the most stylish house color site planning as with building character these features of site character are organized in order of decreasing visual importance building setback generally old poland houses tend to be near the street with a dooryard the oldest buildings stone tavern the brick truesdale house are very close to the sidewalk important stylish houses the town hall are set back within a yard only those built after the passage of the zoning consistent deep setbacks of forty to fifty feet as required in that generally poland buildings are close together with partial screening of the view into the backyard few sideyards are totally closed or screened neither are backyards open and public as with front setbacks important houses have wide side yards outbuildings these include barns carriage houses sheds privies smoke houses ice houses etc every house had at least one outbuilding a privy most had a carriage house generally outbuildings complemented the main house in materials form and color  often they were very stylish in most of the nineteenth century board and batten siding was frequently used on outbuildings early buildings often have later outbuildings these buildings are extremely important parts of the visual landscape once they far outnumbered dwellings today many have disappeared so that those remaining are increasingly precious additions to the visual character fences and retaining walls fencing was essential to village life cows wandered loose in the early nineteenth century throughout the century poland was a center for the sale of sheep wool and cattle all of which came to market on the hoof early fences especially around fields and gardens were rails tree stumps slash woven branches and dense bushes such as hawthorne homesites had more stylish fencing usually vertical or horizontal board fences pickets or pales when iron became readily available cast and wrought iron fencing grew in popularity because of its durability yard fencing usually was near the sidewalk or street edge with frequent painting fencing will last well over fifty years little of polands fencing has survived the landscape looks very different without it early retaining walls were built of native sandstone with dry joints at important locations the stone was dressed and laid in courses  images00072jpg  planting as noted in historic poland poland yards still have many early plant materials both deciduous and evergreen throughout the nineteenth century poland was important for its nurseries and hybrid plant development yard planting of this period was distinguished by a wide variety of plants  by wild mixing of textures and colors flowers and smells  and by enthusiasm for exotic and native plants and vines plants were collected almost like objects of art to be shown off to all visitors yard furniture to complement the planting and add interest to a yard or garden most yards by the 1850s included urns seats and benches iron or stone animals gazebos greenhouses or garden houses even fountains these decorative features have disappeared from most poland yards the most notable exceptions are the stone bear and playhouse at the kirtlandhine house houses did not have eagles or other plaques doorway lights or lamp posts until well into the twentieth century walkways and paths every house had a walk from the front doorway to the street early in the nineteenth century it was gravel covered or made of broke bricks bats later it was made of cut sandstone or brick concrete walks are a modern style as are walks that run to the drive instead of the street the street edge devil strip planting poland streets had deciduous shade trees in front of houses along the street edge by the 1840s tree types varied on each lot  all trees were native  locust tulip poplar and other flowering trees were particularly popular not flowering shrubs when sidewalks were built the shade trees provided necessary shade for pedestrians by this time conifers particularly larch and hemlocks were used in devil strip planting as well as native deciduous trees the edge of the street since the earliest days has been planted in grass sidewalks polands first sidewalks were board walks and paving in front of heavily used village buildings especially taverns after 186 sandstone sidewalks were laid along at least one side of all village main streets most of these original sidewalks have been replaced with concrete walks most poland streets laid out from the 1860s up to the 1950s had at least a sidewalk on one side since the 1950s no new streets included sidewalks example in front of 424 s main street power poles every street in poland has highly visible power poles on at least one side occasionally these poles also have street lights attached to them curbs poland had no curbs on its streets until this century the oldest curbs are cut sandstone  most curbs are concrete curb placement follows no pattern although all commercial streets and properties do have street curbing example in front of 424 s main street passed 11580 part fourteen  building and housing
