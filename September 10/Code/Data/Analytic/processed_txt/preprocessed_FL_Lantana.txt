nov 8 1999   adopted nov 26 2001  and  adopted dec 9 2002 article i  in general generally a declaration of legislative intent it is the purpose and intent of the town council to promote the health safety and welfare of existing and future residents of and visitors to the town of lantana by establishing minimum standards for the installation and continued maintenance of landscaping on all property within the town in order to 1 improve and preserve the aesthetic appearance of residential neighborhoods and commercial and mixeduse properties to ensure attractive streetscapes and vistas throughout the town in order to promote a more pleasant environment  2 improve environmental quality by recognizing and encouraging the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment including a the improvement of air and water quality natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake  b maintaining the ability of the soils to contribute to aquifer recharge  c reducing and reversing air noise heat and chemical pollution biological filtering capacity of trees and other vegetation  d promoting energy conservation creation of shade the reduction of heat gain in or on buildings and paved areas and reducing the temperature of the microclimate process of evapotranspiration  e reducing the erosion of soils  f reducing surface velocity of winds  and g other beneficial effects  3 maintain and enhance property values by camouflaging the harsh outlines of masonry metal and glass construction materials  providing for increased economic value by serving as a capital asset when properly incorporated into site design  providing for an attractive landscaped appearance of commercial industrial residential and mixeduse areas  and providing for buffering of incompatible land uses  4 encourage the preservation of acceptable existing native vegetation and conserving natural ecosystems by incorporating these into the landscape design and encourage the utilization of xeriscape landscaping techniques whenever possible  5 encourage the eradication or control of certain enumerated exotic plant species which have become nuisances because of their tendency to damage public and private improvements or to destroy native ecosystems  encourage sound development and forestry practices in particular with respect to tree protection and discourage poor land development practices such as speculative grubbing razing or clear cutting of lots when no bona fide site development plans have been prepared  6 establish minimum landscaping standards and criteria for all development within the town  7 implement the goals objectives and polices of the comprehensive plan  and 8 promote the conservation of irrigation water utilization of xeriscape

the end of the primary surface an approach zone is designated for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end permitted height limitation within the approach zones is the same as the runway end height at the inner edge and increases with horizontal distance outward from the inner edge as follows a precision instrument runways  permitted height increases one 1 foot vertically for every fifty 50 feet horizontal distance for the first ten thousand 10000 feet and then increases vertically for every forty 40 feet horizontal distance for an additional

extending outward and upward at a  slope from the sides of the primary zones and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal zone height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one 1 foot vertically for every seven 7 feet horizontally extending out at right angles to the runway
