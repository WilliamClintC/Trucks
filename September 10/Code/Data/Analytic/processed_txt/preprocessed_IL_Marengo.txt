are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services nor shall the provisions of this be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services to the extent that any provision or provisions of this are inconsistent with or in

act within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with the city taking into account the nature and scope of the request any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record c the purpose of this is to also establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas the goals of this are to 1 protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas  2 encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas  3 minimize the total number of towers throughout the community  4 strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers  5 encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  6 encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  7 enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  8 consider the public health and safety of communication towers  and 9 avoid potential damage to adjacent

contribution in lieu thereof 604 consumer price index the fair market values identified in a above shall be subject to a cpi adjustment which shall be calculated on  and on the first day of january in

the tree at the center  avoid compacting the soil around existing trees with heavy equipment do not pile dirt or construction materials or waste beneath the crown of the tree  keep fires and sources of extreme heat away from existing trees repair damaged roots and branches immediately exposed roots should be covered with topsoil severed appendix f guide for landscaping limbs and roots should be painted whenever roots are destroyed  a proportional amount of branches should be pruned so the tree does not transpire more water than it takes in injured trees must be thoroughly watered during the next year f4 guidelines for planting trees the trees on the recommended list have minimal maintenance requirements however all trees must receive some care especially during and immediately after planting to ensure survival of newly planted trees the developer should follow standard horticultural and construction practices in the area for the protection of existing lines the following

2feet wider than the root ball and at least 6 inches deeper than the balls depth loosen the soil within another one foot of the pits circumference  if the soil has become compacted loosen the bottom of the pit with a pick ax or shovel  backfill with good soil water backfill as it is placed in the pit  completely cover all roots  immediately after planting support the tree with stakes and wires to hold it firmly in place as its root system begins to develop remove support after one year  spread at least 3 inches of mulch over entire excavation to retain moisture and control weeds add 3 more inches of mulch in a basin shape immediately around the tree  wrap the lower trunks of new trees with burlap or paper to prevent evaporation and sun scald remove after one year  water the tree during

appendix 12and acronyms are defined in appendix 13 not all development is regulated by this but development that is regulated requires a stormwater management permit before construction is allowed to commence some development is regulated b ecause of its size such as development that hydrologically disturbs 5000 square feet or more  development that hydrologically disturbs 50% or more of a parcel  and development that results in an additional 20000 square feet of impervious area since the original effective date of th i s development is regulated because of its location regardless of its size examples include development that is located partially or completely in a flood hazard area or wetland the basic steps used to determine whether a particular project requires a stormwater management permit are listed below the permitting flow charts in appendix 1provide additional guidance if you have any questions about this its applicability to a specific project please contact the mchenry
