adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motion picture theaters or adult arcades and especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection aids genital herpes hepatitis b non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  and the incidence of many of these diseases is on the mcrease sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities classifying adult businesses as special exception uses is a reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and conditions and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation there is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime the downgrading of property values and the decline of the overall character of the community a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this it is generally recognized that adult businesses due to their nature have sttto serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area a number of

evaluation of measures to minimize adverse effects i infiltration bmps should be spread out made as shallow as practicable and located to maximize use of natural onsite infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this normally dry open top storage facilities should completely drain both the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm k the design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of discharge should be obtained from the latest version of the precipitationfrequency atlas of the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service hydrometeorological design studies center silver spring maryland noaas atlas 145 can be accessed at  l for all regulated activities swm bmps shall be designed implemented operated and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of this to meet all requirements under title 25 of the pennsylvania the clean streams law and the storm water management act m various bmps and their design standards are listed in the bmp manual4  exemptions a regulated activities that result in cumulative earth disturbances less than enter no more than one acre a more restrictive area may be entered are exempt from the requirernents in of this ordinance b c agricultural activity is exempt from the swm site plan preparation requirements of this the activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 pa  c forest management and timber operations are exempt from the swm site plan preparation requirements of this the activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 pa  d exemptions from any provisions of this not relieve the applicant from the requirements in d e the municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this any time for any project that the municipality believes may pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment volume controls the green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the bmp manual4 shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible  water volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in or the simplified method in below for regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities this no preference for either methodology  therefore the applicant may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology and other factors a the design storm method cg1 in the bmp manual4 is applicable to any size of regulated activity this method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions 1 do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the 2year 24hour duration precipitation 2 for modeling purposes a existing predevelopment nonforested pervious areas must be considered rneadow in good condition b enter a percentage no less than 20% up to 100% of existing impervious area when present shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions b the simplified method cg2 in the bmp manual provided below is independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not followed this method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities for new impervious surfaces_ 1 stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two 2 inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces 2 at least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow ie it shall not be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth removal options include reuse evaporation transpiration and infiltration 3 wherever possible infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff  however in all cases at least the first 05 inch of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated 4 this method is exempt from the requirements of rate controls rate controls a for areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved act 167 stormwater management plan postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1 2 5 10 25 50 and 100year 24hour storm events if it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for 1 2 5 10 25 50 and 100year 24hour storms then the requirements of this section have been met otherwise the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement b for areas covered by a release rate map from an approved act 167 stormwater management plan for the 1 2 5 10 25 50 and 100year 24hour storm events the postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps for any areas not shown on the release rate maps the post development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates riparian buffers a in order to protect and improve
