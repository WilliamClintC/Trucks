fund 2 recreation fund 3 transportation impact fund 4 watersewer district fund 5 capital projects fund 6 liquid fuels fund 7 any new fund created by the legislative body unless specifically exempted b

to be used by investment officials shall be the prudent person standard officers and designated employees acting in accordance with this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual securitys credit risk or market price changes provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to

of principal is the foremost objective investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation  194 pine code  195   196 specific objectives the financial management team will consider the following factors when making investment decisions of capital in the overall portfolio the goal will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk b liquidity investments shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated c return on investment funds shall be invested with the objective of attaining a market rate of return

risk within the investment portfolio while attaining marketbenchmark rates of return the township of pine shall diversify its investments among institutions to prevent overconcentration in an entity

diversification  however a reasonable temporary imbalance will not significantly impair this strategy as long as it is monitored regularly amended 572018 by res no 990 b maximum maturities the financial management team will attempt to match maturity dates of investments as closely as possible with anticipated cash flow requirements in the general fund investments will be limited to those with maturity dates of one year or less in the other funds a longer maturity date may be used only if the rate of return is advantageous and the maturity date coincides with the expected use of the funds c performance standards 1 the financial assets of the township will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy but the expectation is that the assets should obtain a market average rate of return during an economic environment of stable interest rates when interest rates are forecast to rise in the near future the prudent person standard dictates that care be taken not to tie up large amounts of funds at a fixed interest rate that is expected to be lower than the expected future market rate conversely when interest rates are forecast to decline it is prudent to take advantage of investments bearing an interest rate that is higher than the expected future market rate 2 financial performance should be gauged against an appropriate benchmark such as the threemonth us treasury bill rate or the monthly average federal funds rate  195 fire districts  197   197 authorized investments  198 custodial credit risk pa act 72 custodial credit risk is the

the pine creek or applicable watershed a statement of findings the board of supervisors of the township of pine finds that 1 stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater 2 public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater 3 nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth 4 inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases pollution of water resources 5 stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 6 federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permittees are required to enact implement and enforce a

increase in the postdevelopment peak rate of stormwater runoff from any outfall on the development site shall be subject to releaserate percentage for the watershed subarea in which the site or outfall is located a listing of the releaserate percentage for each subarea in the pine creek watershed appears as appendix e126 at the end of this section and the subareas are delineated on the watershed subarea map see appendix d127 and as such is maintained in the townships office in the watershed plan  definition the releaserate percentage defines the percentage of the redevelopment peak rate of runoff that 126 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter 127 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter  84125 sewers  84125  can be discharged from an outfall on the site after development it applies uniformly to all land developments or alterations within a subarea and the postdevelopment rate of runoff discharging from each outfall of the development site cannot exceed the releaserate percentage for the subarea in which it is located  procedure for use the steps that must be followed to utilize the releaserate percentage for a particular development site are as follows a identify from the watershed subarea map the specific subarea in which the development site is located and obtain the subarea releaserate percentage b compute the pre and postdevelopment runoff hydrographs for each stormwater outfall for the site using the soil cover complex method scs tr55 for the two five ten twentyfive and one hundredyear design storms applying no onsite detention for stormwater management but including any techniques to minimize impervious surfaces andor increase the time of concentration for stormwater runoff flowing over the development site if the postdevelopment peak runoff rate is less than or equal to the predevelopment peak runoff rate then additional stormwater control shall not be required at that outfall if the postdevelopment peak runoff rate is greater than the predevelopment value then stormwater detention will be required and proceed to 3bc below c multiply the subarea releaserate percentage by the predevelopment rate of runoff from the development site to determine the maximum allowable release rate from any detention facility for the two five ten twentyfive and onehundredyear design storm events b noharm evaluation  an applicant may seek to extend the otherwise applicable subarea releaserate percentage by performing the noharm evaluation which requires an independent engineering

shall perform the necessary maintenance or corrective work the owner shall reimburse pine for all costs associated with the required maintenance of the stormwater control facilities a statement of findings the governing body of the township of pine finds that 1 inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases pollution of water resources 2 reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 3 stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 4 federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permittees are required to enact implement and enforce a prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittees regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s b purpose the purpose of this  841251 is to promote health safety and welfare within the township of pine and

best management practices  bmps as described below are suitable for small stormwater management projects however their application depends on the volume required to be controlled how much land is available and the site constraints proposed residential development activities can apply both nonstructural and structural bmps to control the volume of runoff from the site a number of different volume control bmps are described below note that figure 1 is an example of how these bmps can be utilized in conjunction to control the total required volume on one site structural bmps 1 infiltration trench an infiltration trench is a linear stormwater bmp consisting of a continuously perforated pipe at a minimum slope in a stone filled trench during small storm events infiltration trenches can significantly reduce volume and serve in the removal of fine sediments and pollutants runoff is stored between the stones and infiltrates bottom of the facility and into the soil matrix runoff should be pretreated using vegetative buffer strips or swales to limit the amount of coarse sediment entering the trench which can clog and render the trench ineffective in all cases an infiltration trench should be designed with a positive overflow design considerations although the width and depth can vary it is recommended that infiltration trenches be limited in depth to not more than six  6 feet of stone trench is wrapped in nonwoven geotextile  top sides and bottom trench needs to be placed on uncompacted soils slope ofthe trench bottom should be level or with a slope no greater than 1% a minimum of 6 of topsoil is placed over trench and vegetated the discharge or overflow from the infiltration trench should be properly designed for anticipated flows cleanouts or inlets should be installed at both ends ofthe infiltration trench and at appropriate intervals to allow access to the perforated pipe volume of facility   depth x width x length x void space of the gravel bed  assume 40% maintenance catch basins and inlets should be inspected and cleaned at least two times a year the vegetation along the surface ofthe infiltration trench should be maintained in good condition and any bare spots should be re vegetated as soon as possible vehicles should not be parked or driven on the trench and care should be taken to avoid soil compaction by lawn mowers a32

to catch and filter rainfall runoff the garden captures rain from a downspout or a paved surface the water sinks into the ground aided by deep rooted plants that like both wet and dry conditions the ideal location for a rain garden is between the source of  runoff roofs and driveways and the runoff destination  drains stream low spots etc design considerations a maximum of 3 1 side slope is recommended the depth of a rain garden can range from 6  8 inches ponded water should not exceed 6 inches the rain garden should drain within 72 hours the garden should be at least 10 20 feet from a building s foundation and 25 feet from septic system drainfields and wellheads if the site has clay soils soil should be amended with compost or organic material choose native plants see  pa audubon org habitat pdfs rgbrochure complete pdf for a native plant list to find native plant sources go to wwwpawildflower org at the rain garden location the water table should be at least 2 below the soil level if water stands in an area for more than one day after a heavy rain you can assume it has a higher water table and is not a good choice for a rain garden maintenance water plants regularly until they become established inspect twice a year for sediment buildup erosion and vegetative conditions mulch with hardwood when erosion is evident and replenish annually prune and remove dead vegetation

rain garden area is multiplied by 2 112 sq feet   2   224 sq feet  the rain garden should be about 225 sq feet  in size and 6 deep 3 dry well a ka seepage pit a dry well sometimes called a seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily stores and infiltrates stormwater runoff from the roofs of structures by capturing runoff at the source dry wells can dramatically reduce the increased volume of stormwater generated by the roofs of structures roof leaders connect directly into the dry well which may be either an excavated pit filled with uniformly graded aggregate wrapped in geotextile or a prefabricated storage chamber or pipe segment dry wells discharge the stored runoff via infiltration into the surrounding soils in the event that the dry well is overwhelmed in an intense storm event an overflow mechanism  surcharge pipe connection to a larger infiltration are etc will ensure that additional runoff is safely conveyed downstream design considerations dry wells typically consist of 18 to 48 inches of clean washed uniformly graded aggregate with 40% void capacity  aashto no 3 or similar  clean gravel fill should average one and one half to three  1 5  3 0 inches in diameter dry wells are not recommended when their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding in general 10  20 feet of separation is recommended between dry wells and building foundations the facility may be either a structural prefabricated chamber or an excavated pit filled with aggregate depth of dry wells in excess of three and a half 3 5 feet should be avoided unless warranted by soil conditions stormwater dry wells must never be combined with existing rehabilitated or new septic system seepage pits discharge of sewage to stormwater dry wells is strictly prohibited as shown in figure 5 the installation should include a surcharge or overflow pipe a 35 maintenance dry wells should be inspected at least four 4 times annually as well as after large storm events remove sediment debris trash and any other waste material from a dry well regularly clean out gutters and ensure proper connections to the dry well replace the filter screen

runoff by capturing and storing rainfall in the canopy and releasing water into the atmosphere tree roots and leaf litter also create soil conditions that promote the infiltration of rainwater into the soil in addition trees and forests reduce pollutants by taking up nutrients and other pollutants from soils and water root systems a development site can reduce runoff volume by planting new trees or by preserving trees which existed on the site prior to development the volume reduction calculations either determine the cubic feet to be directed to the area under the tree canopy for infiltration or determine a volume reduction credit which can be used to reduce the size of any one of the planned structural bmps on the site tree considerations existing trees must have at least a 4 trunk caliper or larger existing tree canopy must be within 100 feet  of impervious surfaces a tree canopy is classified as the continuous cover of branches and foliage formed by a single tree or collectively by the crowns of adjacent trees new tree plantings must be at least 6 feet  in height and have a 2 trunk caliper all existing and newly planted trees must be native to pennsylvania see_

trench to 27 1 feet  instead of 28 3 feet  2 minimize soil compaction and replant with lawn or meadow when soil is overly compacted during construction it can cause a drastic reduction in the permeability of the soil and rarely is the soil profile completely restored runoff from vegetative areas with highly compacted soils similarly resembles runoff from an impervious surface minimizing soil compaction and re planting with a vegetative cover like meadow or lawn not only increases the infiltration on the site but also creates a friendly habitat for a variety of wildlife species design considerations area shall not be stripped of topsoil vehicle movement storage or equipmentmaterial lay down shall not be permitted in areas preserved for minimum soil compaction the use of soil

explanation under the volume credit for preserving existing trees for details alternative bmp to capture and reuse stormwater rain barrels rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns gardens and other landscaped areas after the rainfall has ended rain barrels are typically between 50 and 200 gallons in size it is not recommended for rain barrels to be used as a volume control bmp because infiltration is not guaranteed after each storm event for this reason a rain barrel is not utilized in the site plan example however the information is included to provide an alternative for a homeowner to utilize when considering capture and reuse stormwater methods design considerations rain barrels should be directly connected to the roof gutterspout there must be a means to release the water stored between storm events to provide the necessary storage volume for the next storm when calculating rain barrel size rain barrels are typically assumed to be 25% full because they are not always emptied before the next storm use screens to filter debris and cover lids to prevent mosquitoes an overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top with an overflow pipe to divert flow away from structures it is possible to use a number of rain barrels jointly for an area a 39 figure 6 rain barrel diagram and
