construction costs construction costs shall be limited to the survey for easement delineation permit fees and hard costs of construction including utility relocation soil testing and site restoration but shall not include the costs of engineering legal and other professional services other than for the easement survey and soil testing inspection fees and administrative costs the construction cost shall be allocated in accordance with the following methodology 1 the total construction cost of the interceptor system and the cost of construction for each segment incurred by each property owner or group of property owners shall be estimated by the township engineer if a group of contiguous property owners agree between or among themselves to be treated by the township as a single property owner the term property owner as used herein may be used to refer to a group of property owners 2 as each property owner constructs its segment of the interceptor system the township engineer shall certify the direct construction cost of that segment and of that property owner and shall adjust if necessary the total construction cost figures 1 above 3 the total sewage volume to be generated from within the district and the estimated flows from each property owner from his or her own property and from any other properties which contribute flows into his or her collection lines shall be estimated and revised from time to time by the township engineer based on present or projected land use regulations and development constraints 4 as each developer receives its preliminary development approvals the township engineer shall certify flow figures per unit or other building type and total flow figures for each developer based on the  20089 west windsor code  20089  then applicable new jersey department of environmental protection sewage flow generation figures and shall adjust if necessary the total flow figures 3 above for properties developed in whole or in part as of the effective date of this subsection the township engineer shall certify flow from the lines as of such date 5 each property owners allocated fair share of the total construction cost shall be determined by multiplying the total construction cost by each property owners projected percentage of the total sewage flow generated within the district this becomes the property owners cost based on flow initially this will be an estimated number but it shall be recalculated for each property owner when certified cost and approved unit and flow figures are determined once established for a property owner this figure shall not be modified because of upstream recalculations 6 property owners whose cost based on flow is less than their certified construction cost figures will have paid more than their allocated fair share and shall be entitled to reimbursement of the differential from the property owners described in 7 below this amount shall be repaid as described in 8 below 7 property owners whose cost based on flow is more than their certified construction cost figures if any will have paid less than their allocated fair share and shall be required to reimburse the differential to the property owners described in 6 above this amount shall be paid to such property owners in proportion to their then outstanding reimbursement entitlements as adjusted under 9 below and the balance if any shall be held by the township for distribution to upstream property owners 8 each property owner within the district except for the most downstream property owner shall also be required to pay to each downstream property owner a benefit cost calculated by multiplying the paying property owners benefit ratio by each downstream property owners then applicable reimbursement amount a the benefit ratio is calculated separately relative to each downstream property owner by determining the paying property owners proportion of the projected total flow in each downstream property owners segment of the interceptor system for this purpose the downstream property owner is assumed to be connected at the upstream point of its line b each downstream property owners then applicable reimbursement amount shall be its original reimbursement amount from 6 above increased by benefit costs  20089 general provisions  20089  paid or payable to property owners downstream of it and reduced by reimbursement amounts paid or payable from intervening upstream property owners interest shall be added to the unpaid reimbursement amount as provided in 10 below 9 after the location where the interceptor system splits between the north branch and the south branch of the duck pond run interceptor the obligation to repay the total of the reimbursement amounts then owed to the property owners who constructed the delaware and raritan canal interceptor shall be divided between the property owners of the north branch and the property owners of the south branch in the ratio which the total reimbursement obligation of each branch is of the total reimbursement obligation of both branches for this purpose the cost of installing the line under route 1 shall be added to the north or the south branch depending on whether the property owner who assumes this obligation is to be served by the north or south branch 10 the computations shall include an interest rate adjustment annually on january 2 of each year commencing in 198 the reimbursement payments and the reimbursement amount remaining unpaid shall be recalculated using an interest rate adjustment but no interest shall be due on interest the interest rate to be used shall be the prime rate of the chase manhattan bank of new york plus 1% 11 the township council may from time to time make such adjustments as may be required to implement and administer this system in accordance with the standard of maintaining an equitable cost allocation system e as a condition of the approval of any development within the district or in the case of developed parcels as a condition of connecting to the interceptor system the township engineer or another representative of the township designated for this purpose shall compute using the methodology described in  the amount which each such property owner is obligated to reimburse and pay to other property owners in the district in the case of development approvals each property owners payment obligation shall be prorated based on the number of units or on the building area in the development and payment shall be required as a condition precedent to the issuance of building permits in the case of developed parcels payment shall be required upon connection to the interceptor system if such parcels are further developed at a later date they shall be treated at such time as separate development applications in accordance herewith except that for parcels partially developed under an approved development plan the property owner shall upon connection to the interceptor system pay that proportion of the amount due which is the same proportion as the total number of units or square footage for which building permits have been issued to the total approved units or square footage and shall  20089 west windsor code  20089  pay the remainder upon issuance of building permits in the manner set forth herein within 30 days of the receipt of payment the township shall disburse the amounts payable similar computations notices and payments shall be processed as building permits for additional units or building area in the development are issued f a property owner shall be

forth in the circulation element to the west windsor township master plan run residential developments or residential developments which are expected to be built in the township many of these roads are already complete because of the cartway widths and radii tangents and other design features of these roads vehicular traffic may and often does travel at higher than the posted speed and at speeds which represent a danger to pedestrians as well as to other motorists this is particularly so because many children and other pedestrians live work and play in close proximity to the roads and must often cross them since they bisect residential neighborhoods given this it is necessary for reasons of public safety to reduce vehicular speed by building friction into the roadway system these roads to two lanes limiting cartway widths providing for medians and bicycle lanes and designating paved areas which are not in use all of which will reduce cartway widths and establishing marked crosswalks and constructing pedestrianactivated signals it is also necessary for public safety reasons to provide better means of pedestrian crossings of these roadways and turning lanes to handle turning movements twolane roadways with landscaped medians with bicycle lanes and with enhanced pedestrian crossings will also protect the integrity of established neighborhoods prevent the division of existing and new neighborhoods by requiring collector roads to be designed so as not to act as physical barriers and maintain and preserve property values  20096 development applications and other developments to which the design standards are applicable233 the design standards set forth in  20097 shall apply to all major and minor collector roads so designated in the circulation plan element

20096 west windsor code  20097   20098 retrofitting improvements to existing collector roads when the collector road to which the design standards apply is in existence the standards set forth in  20097 shall apply except that separating them from the cartway is preferable for safety and site design reasons the intersection treatment for bicycle lanes which are not separated from the cartway shall be as set forth in the intersection details a b and c included in g intersection details intersection details a b and c are included at the end of this chapter a raised and curbed medians shall be located on each side of vehicular intersections for 200 feet to 250 feet depending upon intersection spacing and drainage considerations in the manner set forth in intersection details a b and c

its affordable housing obligations within the redevelopment area dispersed throughout marketrate housing and be architecturally indistinguishable from marketrate housing b 2 the affordable housing obligation will be integrated with market residential units when market units are otherwise permitted in the district d goal 4 1 goal the redevelopment plan will remediate the traffic congestion within around and redevelopment area will incorporate vaughn drive as a principal collector serving both local and will utilize traffic calming on roadways where potential conflicts with bicyclists andor pedestrians exist will include sidewalks and bicycle lanes and will encourage public transit 2 policies a 1 traffic improvements planned for the redevelopment area will provide traffic benefits compared to existing traffic conditions and traffic projected for development permitted by right under current zoning and background traffic conditions in the absence of redevelopment infrastructure proposals traffic improvements planned for the redevelopment area will provide an improved level of service for nonpeakhour and weekend traffic but projected background traffic growth from regional sources will cause failing peakhour level of service at certain intersections planned traffic improvements will however improve traffic distribution and relieve current congestion in the station core area assessment of the redevelopment plan traffic impacts should focus on improvement in traffic circulation over existing conditions and the potential full buildout of development achievable under current zoning b 2 street roadway and bikeway infrastructure  street roadway infrastructure and associated bikeway infrastructure will be planned and constructed in an orderly sequence that is tied to both the staging of land development within the redevelopment area and the availability of funding as discussed in policy 6 the table entitled required roadway and bikeway infrastructure for redevelopment area districts the map entitled conceptual bicyclepedestrian plan and seven maps entitled roadway and bikeway staging illustrate the roadway and bikeway segments and intersection

the sarnoff connector and driveway to sarnoff are required in conjunction with development of the sarnoff property as designated in the general development plan for sarnoff  the above description and table and maps provide a general framework for provision of roadway infrastructure the sequence by which specific properties will be developed will emerge as redevelopment proceeds and therefore there will of necessity be flexibility in the sequencing of roadway construction subelements of each district will require less than the full implementation of roadways for that district as described herein and the township will work with the respective property developers to achieve the optimal timing and sequencing of improvements  the township will periodically reevaluate the location design and timing of street and roadway infrastructure to ensure consistency with the pattern of development that is actually occurring c 3 redevelopmentrelated traffic congestion can be mitigated by innovative
