critical or environmentally sensitive such areas within the city include wetlands streams wildlife habitat significant trees geologic hazards ground water protection areas and flood hazards bthe city finds that these critical areas perform a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents alteration of certain critical areas may also pose a threat to public safety or to public and private property or the environment the city therefore finds that identification regulation and protection of critical areas are necessary to protect the public health safety and general welfare the city further finds that the functions of critical areas and the purpose of these regulations include the following 1wetlands wetlands perform a variety of functions that include maintaining water quality  storing and conveying storm water and flood water  recharging ground water  providing important fish and wildlife habitat  and serve as areas for recreation education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates  reduce sediment chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants  provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures  provide habitat for wildlife  and protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion the primary goals of wetland regulation are to avoid adverse effects to wetlands  to achieve no net loss of wetland function and value acreage may also be considered in achieving the overall goal  to provide levels of protection that reflect the sensitivity of individual wetlands and the intensity of proposed land uses  and to restore andor enhance existing wetlands where possible 2streams streams and their associated riparian corridors provide important fish and wildlife habitat  help to maintain water quality  store and convey storm water and flood water  recharge ground water  and serve as areas for recreation education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation stream buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates  reduce sediment chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants  provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures  provide habitat for wildlife  and protect stream resources from harmful intrusion the primary goals of stream regulation are to avoid adverse effects to streams and associated riparian corridors  to achieve no net loss of functions and values of the larger ecosystem in which the stream is located  to protect fish and wildlife resources  to protect water quality management techniques  and where possible to provide for stream enhancement and rehabilitation 3wildlife habitat wildlife habitat provides opportunities for food cover nesting breeding and movement for fish and wildlife  maintains and promotes diversity of species and habitat  coordinates habitat protection with elements of the open space system  helps to maintain air and water quality  helps control erosion  serves as areas for recreation education scientific study and aesthetic appreciation  and provides neighborhood separation and visual diversity within urban areas the primary goals of wildlife habitat regulation are to avoid adverse effects to critical habitats for fish and wildlife  to achieve no net loss of functions and values of the larger ecosystem in which the wildlife habitat is located  to implement the goals of the endangered species act  to promote connectivity between habitat areas to allow for wildlife movement  to provide multipurpose open space corridors  and where possible to provide for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement and rehabilitation that reflect the sensitivity of the species 4ground water protection areas ground water protection areas provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream dischargeflow such areas contribute to the recharge of aquifers springs andor wells and are susceptible to contamination of water supplies of pollutants soil the primary goals of ground water protection regulations are to protect ground water quality by maintaining the quantity of recharge  avoiding or limiting land use activities that pose potential risk of aquifer contamination  and to minimize or avoid adverse effects to ground water protection areas application of performance standards and to comply with the requirements of the federal safe drinking water act and washington administrative require group a public water systems to develop and implement a wellhead protection program 5geologic hazard areas geologic hazard areas include lands or areas characterized by geologic hydrologic and topographic conditions that render them susceptible to varying degrees of risk of landslides erosion seismic or volcanic activity the primary goals of regulating geologic hazards are to avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property by regulating andor limiting land uses where necessary and to conduct appropriate levels of analysis and ensure sound engineering and construction practices to address identified hazards 6flood hazard areas floodplains help to store and convey storm water and flood water  recharge ground water  provide important areas for riparian habitat  and serve as areas for recreation education and scientific study development within floodplain areas can be hazardous to those inhabiting such development and to those living upstream and downstream floods also cause substantial damage to public and private property that results in significant costs to the public and individuals the primary goals of flood hazard regulations are to limit or condition development within the regulatory floodplain to avoid substantial risk of damage to public and private property and that results in significant costs to the public and individuals  to avoid significant increases in peak storm water flows or loss of flood storage capacity  to protect critical habitat for fish and wildlife and to meet the purposes set forth in acc requirements for the identification assessment alteration and mitigation of flood hazard areas are contained in acc cthis chapter of the auburn city other sections as incorporated by reference contain standards procedures criteria and requirements intended to identify analyze and mitigate potential impacts to the citys critical areas and to enhance and restore degraded resources where possible the general intent of these regulations is to avoid impacts to critical areas in appropriate circumstances impacts to specified critical areas resulting from regulated activities may be minimized rectified reduced andor compensated for consistent with the requirements of this chapter dit is the further intent of this chapter to 1comply with the requirements of the growth management act a rcw and implement rules to identify and protect critical areas and to perform the review of development regulations required by rcw 3670a215  2develop and implement a comprehensive balanced and fair regulatory program that avoids impacts to critical resources where possible that requires that mitigation be performed by those affecting critical areas and that thereby protects the public from injury loss of life property or financial losses due to flooding erosion landslide seismic events soil subsidence or steep slope failure  3implement the goals and policies of the auburn comprehensive plan including those pertaining to natural features and environmental protection as well as goals relating to land use housing economic development transportation and adequate public facilities  4serve as a basis for exercise of the citys substantive authority under the state environmental policy act sepa and the citys environmental review procedures where necessary to supplement these regulations while also reducing the citys reliance on projectlevel sepa review  5provide consistent standards criteria and procedures that will enable the city to effectively manage and protect critical areas while accommodating the rights of property owners to use their property in a reasonable manner  6provide greater certainty to property owners regarding uses and activities that are permitted prohibited andor regulated due to the presence of critical areas  7coordinate environmental review and permitting of proposals involving critical areas with existing development review and approval processes to avoid duplication and delay pursuant to the regulatory reform act b rcw  8establish conservation and protection measures for threatened and endangered fish species in compliance with the requirements of the endangered species act and the growth management act requirements to preserve or enhance anadromous fisheries wac 365195925  9alert members of the public including appraisers assessors owners potential buyers or lessees to the development limitations of critical areas and their required buffers ebest available science the city has considered and included the best available science in developing these regulations consistent with rcw 3670a172 and wac 365195900 et seq this has been achieved identification of relevant technical sources of information consultation with experts in the disciplines covered by this chapter and consultation and requests for technical information regarding best available science from state and federal resource agencies preparation of this chapter has included the use of relevant nonscientific information including consideration of legal social policy economic and land use issues this reflects the citys responsibilities under numerous laws and programs including other provisions of the growth management act and the need to weigh and balance various factors as part of decision making to accomplish municipal objectives this may result in some risk to the functions and values of some critical areas the city will also use its authority under the state environmental policy act sepa to identify consider and mitigate where appropriate significant adverse effects on critical resources not otherwise addressed by the regulations of this chapter the city intends to review and monitor implementation of its critical areas regulations and to use an adaptive management approach it will make adjustments to the regulations as appropriate in response to changing conditions new

users who may be unfamiliar with zoning codes and are unsure of how a particular regulation applies to them procedural sections of the code and decision criteria are addressed in chapters 1860 acc   i am unclear on some of the terms used in the code where can i find definitions acc provides definitions for terms used throughout this title where appropriate sketches and other graphic illustrations have been used to help explain terms and concepts while every effort has been made to define terms consistent with common usage users should consult this section to familiarize themselves and reduce the potential for misunderstandings this section also contains explanations and illustrations of complex concepts that may not be familiar to all users   how do i determine what uses are allowed on a particular property the first step in determining allowed uses is verifying the zoning on the property which can be done by speaking with city of auburn planning department staff or by consulting the citys official zoning map when verifying a propertys zoning it is also important to note any overlays that may be marked on the zoning map overlays may have additional requirements or otherwise modify the allowed uses and development standards for a zone regulations for overlays such as those established for lea hill west hill and designated urban separator areas are contained in acc the sections devoted to particular zones described on the zoning map form the framework of the zoning code each of these sections contains the intent statement for the particular zone a table of allowed uses as well as tables for dimensional standards building height setbacks and lot coverage and crossreferences to other standards such as landscaping and parking requirements it is important to note that each section contains only regulations that apply specifically to that zone and development standards that apply to all zones are addressed references to other chapters of the zoning code   where do i find information about landscaping signs and parking requirements in order to make the individual zone chapters easier to read supplementary regulations or specialized topics applied more broadly than at a specific zone level such as landscaping parking signage and nonconforming uses are discussed separately chapters 1850 acc provide detailed information on these and similarly broad topics while the relevant portions of these sections will be referenced by the zonespecific chapters these chapters are also a good place to look for information on existing or proposed land uses not explicitly listed

use control over indian lands the designation of city zoning and land use regulations that might appear to affect any indian lands does not and is not intended to usurp or exercise land use control

regulations based on hisher analysis of them together with clear and objective reasons for such interpretation bcn neighborhood shopping center zone the cn zone is intended to provide areas appropriate for neighborhood shopping establishments which provide limited retail business service and office facilities for the convenience of residents of the neighborhood a neighborhood shopping center is designed and located so as to minimize traffic congestion on public highways and streets in its vicinity and to best fit the general land use pattern of the area to be served by the center the protective standards contained in this chapter are intended to minimize any adverse effect of the neighborhood shopping center on nearby property values and to provide for safe and efficient use of the neighborhood shopping center itself cc1 light commercial zone the c1 zone is intended for lower intensity commercial adjacent to residential neighborhoods this zone generally serves as a transition zone between higher and lower intensity land uses providing retail and professional services this zone represents the primary commercial designation for small to moderatescale commercial activities compatible by having similar performance standards and should be developed in a manner which is consistent with and attracts pedestrianoriented activities this zone encourages leisure shopping and provides amenities conducive to attracting shoppers and pedestrians dc2 central business district zone the intent of the c2 zone is to set apart the portion of the city proximate to the center for financial commercial governmental professional and cultural activities uses in the c2 zone have common or similar performance standards in that they represent types of enterprises involving the rendering of services both professional or to the person or onpremises retail activities this zone encourages and provides amenities conducive to attracting pedestrians ec3 heavy commercial zone the intent of the c3 zone is to allow for medium to high intensity uses consisting of a wide range of retail commercial entertainment office services and professional uses this zone is intended to accommodate uses which are oriented to automobiles either as a mode or target of the commercial service while fostering a pedestrian orientation the uses allowed can include outside activities display fabrication or service features when not the predominant portion of the use the uses enumerated in this classification have potential for impacts to surrounding properties and street systems than those uses permitted in the more restrictive commercial classifications fc4 mixeduse commercial zone the intent of the c4 zone is to provide for a pedestrianoriented mix of retail office and limited multiplefamily residential uses this classification is also intended to allow flexibility in design and the combination of uses that is responsive to market demands the uses enumerated in this classification anticipate a mix of multiplefamily residential retail and office uses that are coordinated sitespecific planning process the multiplefamily residential must be located in a multistory building  the ground floor of which must contain a permitted use or combination of uses other than parking as listed in this chapter certain heavy commercial uses permitted in other commercial classifications are not permitted in this zone because of the potential for conflicts with multifamily residential uses in order to achieve a quality of environment that is conducive to this mix of uses gm1 light industrial zone the intent of the m1 zone is to accommodate a variety of industrial commercial and limited residential uses in an industrial park environment to preserve land primarily for light industrial and commercial uses to implement the economic goals of the comprehensive plan and to provide a greater flexibility within the zoning regulations for those uses which are nonnuisance in terms of air and water pollution noise vibration glare or odor the light industrialcommercial character of this zone is intended to address the way in which industrial and commercial uses are carried out rather than the actual types of products made the character of this zone will limit the type of primary activities which may be conducted outside of enclosed buildings to outdoor displays and sales uses which are not customarily conducted indoors or involve hazardous materials are considered heavy industrial uses under this title and are not appropriate for the m1 zone an essential aspect of this zone is the need to maintain a quality of development that attracts rather than discourages further investment in light industrial and commercial development consequently site activities which could distract from the visual quality of development of those areas such as outdoor storage should be strictly regulated within this zone hep environmental park zone the environmental park district is intended to allow uses in proximity to the auburn environmental park that benefit from that location and will complement the park and its environmental focus uses allowed in this zone will focus upon medical biotech and green technologies including energy conservation engineering water quality and similar uses other uses complementary to and supporting these uses are also allowed incorporation of sustainable design and green building practices will be a primary aspect of this zone the construction of leadership in energy and environmental design leed and built green certified buildings is encouraged and built green will be required for multiplefamily dwellings the city recognizes that much of the property in this zone was developed under earlier standards so the goals of the district will be realized over a period of time as properties are redeveloped im2 heavy industrial zone the m2 zone is intended to accommodate a broad range of manufacturing and industrial uses permitted activity may vary from medium to higher intensity uses that involve the manufacture fabrication assembly or processing of raw andor finished materials heavy industrial uses should not be located near residential development while other uses may be sited within this zone permits for such uses should not be issued if such uses will discourage use of

239 acc  intent the intent of this chapter is to provide for the operation and management of the auburn municipal airport it is found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the municipal airport and of occupants of land or property in its vicinity and also if of the obstruction type in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing taking off and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the municipal airport and the public investment therein accordingly it is declared that athe creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the municipal airport  bit is necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented  and cthe prevention of these hazards should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the police power without

established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the noninstrument approach zone transition zone horizontal zone conical zone and obstacle free areas such areas and zones are shown on the city of auburn municipal airport master plan update 19932013 dated february 199 and federal air regulations far as amended which is on file in the city clerks office the various zones are established and defined as follows in acc      approach zone a noninstrument approach surface is established at each end of all noninstrument runways for landings and takeoffs the inner width of the approach surface is 250 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond the physical end of the runway and it expands uniformly to a width of 1250 feet this approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of 5000 feet at a slope of twenty to one  the elevation of the inner width of the approach surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline     transitional zone the transitional surface extends outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extends at a slope of seven to one  from a line 125 feet from the runway centerline or runway end and from the sides of the approach surfaces the elevation of the line 125 feet from the runway centerline or runway centerline extended for 200 feet beyond each runway end is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline     horizontal zone a horizontal surface is established above the airport this horizontal surface is a plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs 5000 feet in a radius from the center of each end of the primary surface of the runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs the primary surface is longitudinally centered on the runway with a width of 250 feet and extends 200 feet beyond each end of the runway     conical zone a conical surface is established which extends outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one  for a horizontal distance of 4000 feet     obstacle free area an area extending 250 feet either side of the runway and 600 feet off either end of the runway the obstacle free area ofa must be kept clear of any structures fencing landscaping parking or vehicular circulation not directly related to aircraft operations at the auburn municipal airport   height limitations generally except as otherwise provided in this chapter no structure or tree shall be erected altered allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created in this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established in acc  such zone     height limitations noninstrument approach zone the height limitations for noninstrument approach surfaces begin at a point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the runway and extend for a horizontal distance of 5000 feet at a slope of twenty to one      height limitations transition zones the height limitations for transition zones shall be as follows one foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point 125 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of noninstrument runways extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 59 feet above mean sea level in addition to the foregoing there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces     height limitations horizontal zones the height limitation for a horizontal zone shall be as follows 150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 209 feet above mean sea level     height limitations conical zones the conical surface involves a slope of twenty to one  for a horizontal distance of 4000 feet the relative difference in elevation between the inner and outer edge of the conical surface is 200 feet the elevation of the outer edge of the conical surface is 300 feet above the established airport elevation     nonconforming structures and trees continuation allowed when the regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of  or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use     nonconforming structures and trees marking and lighting notwithstanding the provisions of acc  the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as are deemed necessary by the airport manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such aircraft hazards such markers and lights shall be installed and operated and maintained by the city     structure and use permits except as specifically provided in subsections a b and c of this section no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected altered planted or otherwise established in any zone created by this chapter unless a permit has been applied for and granted by the building department of the city each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient information to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use structure or tree would conform to the regulations therein prescribed if such determination is in the affirmative the permit shall be granted ain the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when because of terrain land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone bin the area lying within the limits of the noninstrument approach surface but at a horizontal distance of not less than 5000 feet from a point 200 feet from each end of the runway no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when such trees or structures would extend above the height limit prescribed for such noninstrument approach zone cthe transitional surface does not extend beyond the perimeter of the horizontal surface     nonconforming structures or trees alteration abefore any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced substantially altered or repaired rebuilt allowed to grow higher or replanted a permit must be secured from the airport manager and if applicable the building official bno permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on  or than it is when the application for a permit is made except as indicated all applications for such a permit shall be granted     nonconforming structures or trees abandoned or destroyed permit prohibited whenever the airport manager determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down physically deteriorated or decayed no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations     requirements for variances any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the hearing examiner for a variance from such regulation such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulation should result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter     variance grant conditions any variance granted may if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and is reasonable in the circumstances be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree requesting a variance to install operate and maintain at his own expense such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to fliers the presence of an airport hazard     decision appeals generally any person aggrieved or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the city made in its administration of this chapter may appeal to the hearing examiner     conflicting regulations where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same area whether the conflict is with respect to the height of structures or trees the use of land or any other matter the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail     enforcement it shall be the duty of the airport manager and building official to administer and enforce the

approved pud therefore this purpose section shall apply to minor and major amendments to the lakeland hills south pud the purpose of a planned unit development pud district is to offer enhanced flexibility to develop a site alternative development standards a pud district also allows for a greater range of residential development scenarios provides for internal transfers of density and may result in more dwelling units than may be realized by using the existing development standards in exchange for this enhanced flexibility the city will require the pud to result in a significantly higher quality development generate more public benefit and be a more sensitive proposal than would have been the case with the use of standard zoning or subdivision procedures in order for a pud to be approved it will be the applicants responsibility to demonstrate to the citys satisfaction that the proposed pud achieves or is consistent with the following desired public benefits and expectations in whole or in part apreservation of natural amenities preservation of desirable site characteristics such as open spaces and the protection of sensitive environmental features including steep slopes rivers creeks wetlands lakes and scenic views bpedestrianoriented communities use of traffic management and design techniques to reduce traffic congestion and increase the potential use of alternative modes of travel such as mass transit pedestrian and bicycle traffic cland use efficiencies provide efficient and effective use of land open space and public facilities that result in
