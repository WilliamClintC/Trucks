or other liquids into the town sewage system either directly or indirectly and it can be shown by such party to the satisfaction of the director that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sewerage system the director may determine in such manner and by such method as he or she may find practicable the percentage of metered water entering the sewerage system the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be that percentage so determined of the water measured by the water meter or meters  or the director may require or permit the installation of acceptable additional water or sewer meters at such partys expense and in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system as so determined if such additional water or sewer meters are installed an additional charge shall be made to cover the cost of reading and computing the flow of each such meter and such additional charge
