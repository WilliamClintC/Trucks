procedures nature of variances athe variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the properly owners bit is the duty of the city commission to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  designation and duties of variance and appeal board athe city commission of nicholasville shall establish an appeal board consisting of members of the board of adjustments bthe appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter cany person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court as provided in kentucky revised statutes  appealsvariance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges  conditions for variances aupon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 7variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of 1 11 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance  variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and  2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the nicholasville recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency  historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition in  upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure  no impact certification within the floodway variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in

cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  2this storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  3storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of storm water runoff from development sites  and 4buffers adjacent to stream systems and coastal areas provide numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits which can include restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources  removing pollutants delivered in urban storm water  reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation  stabilizing stream banks  providing infiltration of storm water runoff  maintaining base flow of streams  contributing the organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem  providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic organisms  providing riparian wildlife habitat  and furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity btherefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation and to protect and maintain the native vegetation in riparian and wetland areas it is determined that the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety    purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum storm water management and vegetative buffer

adoption of these regulations and is thereby designated as the administering agency 120 purpose  once open land has been divided into streets and parcels a pattern has been established which may determine how well community needs for residential public commercial and industrial land will be met it will also affect the communitys ability to handle traffic problems and the economic provision of public utilities assuring that this development is in harmony with community objectives is therefore a matter of serious public concern it is therefore declared to be the policy of the nicholasville planning commission to consider land subdivision plats as part of a plan for the orderly efficient and economical development of the land within its general welfare the purpose of the standards and procedures included is to first provide a guide for the change that occurs when land becomes urban in character as a result of development for residential commercial or industrial purposes  second to provide assurances that the purchasers of lots are buying a commodity suitable for development and use  and third to assure the proper provision of public services in an efficiently safe and orderly manner conductive to the minimum outlay of public and private expenditures this shall be interpreted to include the following provisions which shall guide the planning commission in formulating its decisions 121  land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health and welfare from flooding fire contamination erosion or other menace 122  proper provision shall be made for drainage water and energy supply sewerage and other needed improvements at such a rate as will accommodate the anticipated rate of development 123  proposed streets shall compose a convenient and efficient traffic circulation system properly related to the proposals of the transportation plan streets shall be of such width grade and location to accommodate prospective traffic provide adequate light and air and to provide access by service and emergency vehicles 2 124  land of suitable location size and character for utility or drainage easements or public community services shall be shown on the subdivision plat wherever appropriate 125  subdivision plats shall show such information as required to establish the exact location and dimension of each parcel of land in order to provide adequate records for land titles 130 jurisdiction  in accordance with the kentucky revised statutes these regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the city of nicholasville kentucky as now or hereafter established any owner of land within these areas or his representative wishing to subdivide land shall

discrepancy between minimum standards set forth in these regulations and those of any other lawfully adopted rules regulations ordinance or resolutions the most restrictive or highest standards shall apply 141  nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the subdivider from placing selfimposed restrictions or imposing higher standards than required by these regulations but not in violation of these regulations on the development however such restrictions shall be indicated or attached to the plat for processing by the commission and filing with the county clerk 150 separability  the invalidity of any provision of these regulations shall not invalidate any other part thereof which is not itself invalid 160 amendments  the planning commission may recommend to the nicholasville city commission revisions and modifications of these regulations from time to time by holding a public hearing on the proposed changes after giving notice as required by krs it shall then make its recommendation on the proposed changes to the legislative body it shall take a majority of the entire legislative body to override the recommendations of the planning commission 170 procedures 171

the planning commission is authorized under kentucky revised statute  to specify design requirements for streets blocks lots utilities recreation areas other public facilities and hazardous areas including land subject to flooding within the city of nicholasville furthermore the commission is responsible for insuring that such standards are enforced during development as a condition of subdivision plat approval these standards for public improvements shall be utilized to assure the conformance of subdivision to the comprehensive plan and zoning standards set forth in this section are considered to be minimum acceptable standards of design acceptable for safe efficient and economical community development generally the developer shall be responsible for providing the land and constructing those public improvements required to serve his development where the commission determines that excess capacity facilities are needed as defined in the respective sections the legislative body may be consulted for arrangements to cover the cost of that capacity required beyond what is needed to serve the immediate development 201 selfimposed regulations  the subdivider may provide for final maintenance of common facilities or place restrictions on development more restrictive than those provisions if any shall be noted in the deed restrictions which shall be made a part of the commissions record 210 lot design standards  the size proportion and orientation of individual parcels of land and the buildings placed on them will vary with intended type of land use and with the geologic characteristics of the land many of these characteristics are determined zoning regulations governing the use of land ie minimum lot size yard requirements building setback and lot coverage other principles of lot use and layout are more generally applicable and are basic to principles of good subdivision design see figures 7 & 8 pages 73 and 74 of these regulations 211 general lot layout guidelines 2111 conform to zoning requirements  the site and proportions of lots in any subdivision shall conform to the zoning of the property in effect at the time of final plat

reduced by not more than ten 10 feet the lot adjacent to the corner lot with the designated secondary frontage may be reduced by five 5 feet the next adjacent lot shall be laid out so as to provide the minimum front yard requirement if a primary and secondary street frontage is to be utilized they shall be shown on the proposed subdivision plat when submitted for review access to corner lots shall be at least fifty 50 feet from the intersection of street rightofways unless otherwise specified by 6 topography  all parcels shall be laid out as related to topography whenever possible at or

primary access for any use where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the access street provision shall be made for the installation of a culvert or other structure of a design approved by the city engineer or other authorized person 220 subdivision design principles  the following sections specify the interrelationships between characteristics of the land slope soil composition woodlands and the components of urban development of land under these regulations be carried out in harmony with the limitations of the land within these limitations it is intended that flexibility with regard to innovative design and new technology be encouraged 221 relation to land  the street plan and lot arrangement of a proposed subdivision shall be so designed to preserve wherever possible historical or natural features such as trees landmarks water courses and the natural lay of the land and disposition of the topsoil the planning commission may prepare a list of all such features within its area of jurisdiction which it deems worthy of preservation 9 failure of a subdivider to comply with the decision of the planning commission in preservation of any of the above is punishable under 1 unsuitable land conditions  if the commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding poor drainage topography or other such conditions which may endanger health life or property  and if investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned determine that in the best interest of the public that the land should not be developed for the proposed purpose  the commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are proposed by the subdivider for solving those problems that will be created by the development of the land 2212 areas premature for development  the planning commission may refuse to approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the public health safety welfare by reason of a lack of water supply schools proper drainage adequate roads or transportation facilities or other public services  or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for supply of such services 2213 land subject to flooding  land subject to flood shall not be platted for residential use or for any other use which may increase the danger to health life or property or aggravate erosion such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or will not result in conditions contrary to the public welfare to ensure that lots will be located only where they will provide flood free building sites the planning commission shall require the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate that no part of a principal building including crawlspaces or basements proposed to be constructed upon a lot shall be located less than one 1 foot above the flood plain as defined in fill may be used in areas subject to flood if authorized by the commission as part of the construction plans and upon being granted the necessary permits from the state of kentucky provided that it does not increase flood heights to the extent that any existing or proposed principal building including crawlspaces or basements will be located less than one 1 foot above the flood plain as defined in no streets subject to inundation or flooding shall be approved by the commission sinkholes either active or inactive shall not be considered as a viable part of the storm drainage system and shall not be enlarged or opened within proposed developments so as to allow for the discharge of surface water 10 into the ground at a higher rate than existed prior to development development within sinkhole areas can occur if authorized by the commission provided that any existing or proposed street or principal building including crawl spaces or basements will not be located less than one 1 foot above the floodplain as defined in for the purposes of calculating flood elevations the areas within sinkhole drainage boundaries that are or will be located at an elevation below the natural or manmade overflows at the sinkhole boundaries shall not be counted as available storage volume for surface water runoff ie the design engineer shall assume that the sinkholes are filled to the elevations of the natural or manmade overflows at the sinkhole boundaries  principal building  a building in which is conducted the main or principal use of the lot on which said building is located adopted 071802  222 residential development  the subdivision of land for residential purposes shall adhere to sound planning processes in the relationship of land to buildings and to movement systems 2221 blocks  the width of a residential block should accommodate two 2 tiers of lots however where extraordinary physical conditions exist or where lots might otherwise front on an arterial street the commission may approve a single tier of lots of minimum depths block length should be at least 500 feet but shall not exceed 1200 feet or fifteen 15 times the minimum lot width whichever is greater  except when the commission deems it impractical or necessary to allow otherwise to secure efficient use of land under extraordinary physical conditions in which case the commission may require the reservation block of a ten 10 foot wide easement to accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic 2222 street pattern  the arrangement location character width grade and construction of all streets shall conform to the city transportation plan and shall be considered in relationship to existing and planned streets topography access to adjacent land and public convenience and safety the street pattern shall discourage in the interior of a subdivision residential development should not front on arterial class streets see also of these regulations 2223 land remnants  if remnants of land exist after subdividing and have no apparent future use which can be properly controlled they shall be incorporated into the lot pattern of the proposed subdivision 11 223 commercial and industrial development  the location and orientation of commercial and industrial land subdivision shall be consistent with the intent of the nicholasville zoning regulations and in conformance with the adopted land use plan 2231 blocks  block length should be at least 500 feet but shall not exceed 1200 feet or fifteen 15 times the minimum lot width whichever is greater  except when the commission deems it impractical or necessary to allow otherwise to secure efficient use of land under extraordinary physical conditions in which case the commission may require the reservation block of a ten 10 foot wide easement to accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic 2232 minimize impact  lot layout and building arrangement shall be so organized as to minimize the adverse effects of normal business operations and vehicular activities on adjacent land streets serving commercial and industrial activities shall be planned to connect with arterial or collector streets so as not to generate traffic on minor streets 2233 public improvements  the planning commission shall require of the developer public improvements including streets and utilities of capacities adequate to avoid overloading by recommended development in the immediate area 224 mobile home development  development of mobile home sites for rental lease or sale shall conform to the requirements of the appropriate zoning classification of the nicholasville zoning regulations or kentucky revised statute whichever is more restrictive 2241 permit application  the developer of a mobile home park shall apply to the kentucky department of health to obtain a permit to construct or alter a mobile home park prior to filing a preliminary or minor subdivision plat with the planning commission 2242 mobile home park requirements  mobile home parks shall meet the requirements of the kentucky mobile home and recreational vehicle park law adopted by the kentucky state department of health under the authority of the kentucky revised statutes or the standards of these regulations and the nicholasville zoning the highest standards shall apply 225 planned unit development  these regulations may be modified by the planning commission in the case of plans for complete neighborhoods or other design innovations which in the opinion of the commission achieve the basic objectives of these regulations the planning commission may require additional conditions such as covenants or specific notes 12 which it feels necessary to assure conformity to and achievement of the proposed subdivision plan such development proposals shall be accompanied by a compatible zoning plan which complies with the requirements of the nicholasville zoning 1 variances to lot design standards  lot design standards may be varied to accommodate innovative building styles and methods minimum lot sizes may be waived when the difference is made up by available common open space frontage on public streets and single principle use provisions may be waived for cluster developments 2252 variances to subdivision design standards  subdivision design standards may be varied to permit private internal circulation systems use of physical land features and mixture of residential service commercial or industrial land use 2253 variances to transportation facility standards  variances or waivers may be granted for internal circulation systems however all streets intended for dedication must be built to city standards planned unit developments shall conform to all standards applying to arterial and freeway streets 2254 variances to public utility standards  no waivers or variances shall be granted for planned unit developments which would result in lower standards or capacities of construction equipment or service 226 cemeteries  these regulations shall not apply to the subdivision of burial lots in cemeteries except for the requirements to file a plat or record with the jessamine county clerk 230 transportation facility design standards  the planning commission is responsible for assuring that street development conforms to the major street plan with regard to the arrangement character location rightofway and pavement widths and grade proposed streets shall be considered in their relationship to existing and planned streets to public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets streets shall be related to topography in their design in order to produce the most usable building sites whenever possible at or above the grades of the streets  to provide proper drainage for storm water  and to produce proper grades and curves as required by these regulations where it is desirable consideration will also be given to nonmotorized modes of transportation routes including walkways and bikeways 13 231 streets  streets as ways for the movement of vehicular traffic serve two principle functions first the movement of people and goods and second access to adjoining properties unfortunately these two functions are of conflicting nature because the smooth movement of traffic is interrupted by vehicles entering or leaving traffic from or to adjacent property to satisfy the competing street functions of movement and access sound traffic engineering principles require the use of a street classification system of several levels each street classification serves a combination of the two basic functions freeways with access limited to controlled points are exclusively movement corridors arterial streets are also primarily movement streets but also serve adjacent properties access points collector streets are major streets whose function is to collect traffic from local streets and channel it to arterials local streets are the opposite from freeways as locals primarily provide access to lots which front on the street other types of streets which primarily intend to provide accessibility to adjacent property include culdesac streets frontage roads and alleys 2311 responsibility for streets  the developer shall construct streets including all clearing grading laying of subbase base pavements curbs gutters culverts bridges sidewalks storm sewer mains and structures in accordance with current city standards the respective legislative body is not required to accept any street until it has been inspected by the city engineer or other authorized person and has been determined that such construction is in conformance with the approved plans and adopted standards to achieve the purposes of the comprehensive plan the city may require that certain streets serving a subdivision be constructed to higher standards than would be necessary to serve the particular subdivision when higher standards are required the city may assure a proportionate share of the increased cost of construction such cost shall not exceed the difference between that required for construction of the minimum street capable of adequately serving the subdivision and the cost of street construction required by the city 23111 upgrading of streets  when a previously unincorporated area is annexed to the city of nicholasville the city may require that streets be upgraded or cause such streets to be upgraded to conform to city standards the city may refuse to accept dedication of substandard streets or to extend city services to areas served by substandard streets 2312 general street design
