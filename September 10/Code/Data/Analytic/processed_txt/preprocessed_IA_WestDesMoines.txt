the assessable costs of a street improvement project are fairly spread among benefited properties and that no property is assessed an amount greater than the special benefit received b in its sole legislative discretion the city council shall determine whether the application and use of a formula to guide it in establishing the amount of individual assessments meet the criteria established by this the law  7138 benefits a benefit conferred it is the policy of the city not to assess any amount for street improvements in excess of the benefit conferred on a lot or parcel benefits resulting from street improvements which inure to property owners within the assessment area will depend upon the circumstances of each project b nature and extent of benefits as a result of street improvement projects property owners often benefit from enhanced access an improved environment because of dust and drainage control enhancement of aesthetic qualities in the area a decrease in the cost of

incrementally less benefit to parcels of property located a greater distance from the proposed improvements b a depth factor chart and proximity curve as adopted by the city council and on file with the city clerks office shall be used in calculating assessments levied under this method the curve may however be modified by the city council for any street improvement project where reason or circumstances require such modification moreover the council may modify any proposed assessment which results from the application of the curve where reason or circumstances make such modification reasonable or just all modifications however shall be limited to the extent necessary to reflect actual special benefit conferred on the lot or parcel  71310 area district assessment method a the area

the reasonable regulation of specific activities within the jordan creek town center overlay district to ensure that such activities are harmonious with the pedestrian oriented village atmosphere of the district and that the operation of such activities is compatible with the surrounding land uses 2 findings the city council makes the following findings a the town center overlay district is an overlay zoning district that seeks to incorporate residential retail office and recreational activities in a specific area of the city the overall objective of the district is to create a village atmosphere that provides a safe convenient energetic and attractive area in which to live work shop and play b the town center overlay district seeks to achieve a pedestrian friendly environment while offering a varied choice of residential retail office and recreational opportunities c the town center overlay district seeks to balance the presence of office and retail establishments with the goal of creating a traditional residential community attaining a balance between the integration of office and retail establishments with a residential community to achieve a traditional work live and play environment requires reducing the dependence upon and dominance of the automobile and recognizing the appropriate relationship between each permitted land use d certain permitted uses within the town center overlay district provide the appropriate balance and serve to complement other permitted uses within the district however the secondary effects of such uses may be detrimental to the surrounding area e commercial and retail establishments in excess of one hundred thousand 100000 square feet generate significantly more traffic noise and light than other uses permitted within the district f larger retail establishments tend to attract a concentration of customers and traffic patterns that are not compatible with the sleep and domestic patterns of traditional neighborhoods  smaller retail establishments do not attract similar concentrations of customers or such concentrations of traffic patterns g large retail establishments while appropriate at certain hours are inappropriate at other hours due to the generation of traffic noise and light which detrimentally affect both the residential uses of the district and the surrounding residential areas h additionally automotive repair facilities while appropriate in a mixed use environment at certain hours also generate excessive noise due to the nature of the facility and their operation is therefore inappropriate in a mixed use environment after certain hours  sterling codifiers inc  558687 i commercial retail and office uses also require the delivery of merchandise and supplies by commercial motor vehicle which are necessary for the operation of the commercial retail or office use such deliveries often generate noise that may cause undue disruption to the surrounding area j residential uses are more sensitive to the noise and disruption caused by the delivery of the merchandise and supplies making it necessary to balance the needs of the commercial retail and office uses with the needs of the surrounding residential uses k in seeking to provide the desired traditional relationship between all permitted uses within the district while addressing the detrimental effects large commercial andor retail establishments may have on existing land uses both within and surrounding the district the imposition of reasonable conditions is necessary therefore based upon the findings set forth above it is the determination of the city council of the city of west des moines that the following conditions are the most appropriate and least restrictive and are reasonable and necessary to address the detrimental effects resulting from certain uses within the town center overlay district 3 definitions automotive repair facility any and all facilities as established and defined by

periods when it is dark or weather conditions may reduce visibility but not create glare light spillage or trespass with a large illuminated area or excessive brightness unless otherwise specified herein a sign may be illuminated with a number of methods depending upon the type of sign and the district in which the sign is located to the greatest extent possible signs shall be designed to minimize the illumination of excess unused areas of a sign and to reduce the amount of light glow unless noted otherwise direct or unprotected light sources used to illuminate a sign shall neither be visible from any street nor cause glare hazardous light trespass or distraction to pedestrians drivers or adjacent properties a general sign illumination standards 1 all illuminated signs are subject to the provisions of the electrical adopted by the city of west des moines 2 a balance should occur between the ambient light levels of the area project or development and the illumination of a sign the lighting design of a sign must take into account background lighting levels lighting from other sources and the characteristics of the surrounding area if the area has relatively low night lighting levels like in or adjacent to residential properties sign illumination should be reduced or designed to lessen the impact and light trespass in no event shall any illuminated sign exceed a maximum illumination of five thousand 5000 candelas per square meter during daylight hours and a maximum illumination of five hundred 500 candelas per square meter between dusk to dawn as measured

which is particularly true if good window graphics are used or the patrons are primarily pedestrians there may also be businesses that have hours of operation that are primarily daytime hours or have limited patron traffic that could be adequately served with window graphics or other nonilluminated signage b use external illumination that is down cast or uses full cut off or fully shielded fixtures that are designed and aimed so the light falls entirely upon the sign and are positioned so the light source is not visible from any point off the property or from roadways to reduce glare c illuminate the sign with halo lighting or comparable indirect lighting method d any sign surface so situated shall not exceed a maximum of two 2 footcandles as measured at ground level b hours of operation internally illuminated signs on nonresidential properties may be illuminated from five oclock  am until eleven oclock  pm or one 1 hour past the close of business of the facility being

that illuminates the sign content is remote or separate from the sign and aimed at the face of the sign ie spot lights gooseneck lighting or similar external illuminated signs are subject to the following regulations a the source of the light must be concealed by translucent covers or positioned in such a manner that they are not visible to the general public and glare is minimized b external illumination shall be a stationary light source shielded and directed solely at the sign 2 internal illumination is when the sign or sign structure includes light sources that are contained within the sign or structure to produce light around the graphics of the sign the following descriptions define the types of internal illumination and sign design that will be used to identify what signs are acceptable in what areas of the city a reverse channel letters also known as halo lighting channel letter with opaque face and side walls where the individual graphic has an opaque face and a light source inside of the sign that projects the illumination back onto the surface behind the sign with softer indirect light the light source is shielded from view by returns on the sign this type of sign would comply with sections that limit lighting to indirect lighting b individual face lit channel letters threedimensional letters illuminated from behind or containing a light source with translucent face that conveys light forward these types of signs may be in combination with halo lighting  sterling codifiers inc  636687 c opaque face with push through sign lettering or graphic image is cut sign face and backing material and mounted or inlaid so the sign looks as if the lettering or image had been pushed up and out of the sign face and the lettering is translucent to allow lighting the imagery from behind d contoured panel sign three dimensional graphic where the edges are fabricated to closely follow and form an outline of the letter word or graphic this type of sign may be a viable option for script lettering and complex logos where more preferred options would not be possible because of the graphic being presented where this option is determined to be an acceptable alternative the image shall be designed to minimize the illumination of the background so that only the copy or graphic are illuminated e panel signcabinet signbox sign a sign consisting of a frame covered by a translucent material where the entire sign structure is one 1 unit with a common internal lighting source and the graphics are not intended to include threedimensional individual

attention of a viewer traveling in a motor vehicle or seeing the information from a greater distance it is the intent of these regulations to facilitate these intents by establishing design criteria that will guide the design of signage to provide opportunities for creative design options while minimizing sign clutter excessive illumination and possible annoyances to the general public b specific
