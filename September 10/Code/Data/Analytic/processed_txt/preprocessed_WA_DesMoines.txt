and be available for use and examination by the public   city council findings the city council finds that 1development in wetlands results in aincreased soil erosion and sedimentation of downstream water bodies  bdegraded water quality from increased sedimentation  cdegraded water quality from loss of pollutant removal process of wetlands  sediment trapping nutrient removal and chemical detoxification  delimination of wildlife and fisheries habitat wetland ecosystems support a diverse unique and rich group of flora and fauna habitat is especially productive at the interface between water and land ecosystems several wildlife species specifically require wetland habitats for breeding nesting rearing of young and feeding  eloss of ground water discharge and recharge areas  floss of storm water retention and detention capacity resulting in increased flooding degraded water quality and changes in the streamflow regimen of watersheds  gloss of slowrelease detention resulting in loss of recharge to base flow of stream systems during low flow periods and increased peak flows and flooding during storm events  and hloss of fishery resources from water quality degradation increased peak flow rates decreased summer low flows and changes in the streamflow regimen 2development in stream corridors results in asiltation of streams which destroys spawning beds kills fish eggs and alevins irritates fish gills reduces aquatic insect populations fills stream channels and causes flooding  bloss of stream corridor vegetation which raises stream temperatures destabilizes stream banks causes erosion removes nutrients by removing source of fallen leaves and streamside insects increases sedimentation and reduces recruitment of large wood debris necessary for stream structure  celimination of wildlife and fish habitat the stream corridor is especially sensitive and is recognized as being among the most productive terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems it usually provides all four of the basic habitat components water food cover and space the stream corridor is usually richer in habitat diversity and consequently wildlife diversity and numbers of individuals are higher than in adjoining upland plant communities certain fish and wildlife species are totally dependent on the stream corridor and as uplands are developed stream corridors become a place of refuge for many wildlife species  dincreased peak flow rates and decreased summer low flow rates of streams resulting in negative impacts to the physical and chemical requirements critical for sustained fish populations  estream channelization which increases current velocity and bank erosion removes critical fish rearing and spawning habitat and reduces habitat diversity and simplifies the biotic community  fpiping of streamflow and crossing of streams by culverts which increases potential for downstream flooding reduces migratory fishery range and therefore fish populations removes habitat and eliminates the biotic community  and gconstruction near or within streams which adversely impacts fish and wildlife by destroying habitat and degrading water quality and increases potential for flooding property damage and risk to public health safety and welfare 3development on hillsides results in athe loss of slope and soil stability as well as increased erosion the removal of vegetation from hillsides deprives the soil of the stabilizing function of roots and the moderating effects on wind and water erosion of leaves and branches loss of soil stability increases erosion and thus lowers downstream water quality as a result of siltation downstream wetlands can be injured in this way strong rains on unstable slopes can produce mass movements such as landslides slumps and flaws particularly in steeply sloping areas  bincreased runoff development may alter the natural drainage pattern of a hillside producing increased runoff and erosion removal of vegetative cover decreases percolation of precipitation into the soil thereby reducing the amount of ground water recharge and adding water to runoff that would ordinarily be transpired by trees shrubs and ground covers construction of impervious surfaces such as roads parking lots and buildings decreases the amount of ground water percolation and thus increases the amount of runoff increased runoff in addition to producing intensified erosion also creates downstream flood hazards  cdestruction of the communitys aesthetic resources the hillsides of des moines mark the boundaries of several neighborhoods lend natural character and distinctive features to the city and provide open space and viewing points of remarkable vistas they are also often associated with stream corridors and wetlands of the city degradation of hillsides resulting from erosion mass movement loss of vegetation and damage to downstream areas deprives des moines of its attractive and distinctive setting and decreases real estate values  and dmajor public expenditures to repair facility damages and protect against future damages due to instability created or exacerbated by development   special studies

variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope soils or vegetation and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places  cthe total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard

plans shall be consistent with the guidance on wetland mitigation in washington state  guidelines for developing wetland mitigation plans and proposals april 2004 washington state department of ecology us army corps of engineers seattle district and us environmental protection agency region 10  ecology publication no 0406013b or as revised 2mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference aavoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action bminimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps such as project redesign relocation or timing to avoid or reduce impacts crectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment dreducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations ecompensating for the impact by replacing enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments fmonitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary 3compensating for lost or affected functions compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions the goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost except when either athe lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a sitespecific function assessment and the proposed compensatory mitigation actions will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed formal washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol  or boutofkind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types 4preference of mitigation actions methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference arestoration reestablishment and rehabilitation of wetlands bcreation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species this should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design cenhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements 5type and location of compensatory mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either inkind and onsite or inkind and within the same stream reach subbasin or drift cell if estuarine wetlands are impacted compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply athere are no reasonable onsite or in subdrainage basin opportunities eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or onsite and in subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation buffer conditions and proposed widths available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored proposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  boffsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland  and coffsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless iestablished watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or iicredits from a statecertified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the banks certification  dthe design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland an atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland eg created or enhanced that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site ie the water sources and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting likewise it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water for example excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope which required the construction of berms to hold the water 6timing of compensatory mitigation it is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the onsite wetlands at the least compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora the city manager or the city managers designee may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties eg project delay lapses past a fisheries window  or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety and general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan the justification must be verified and approved by the city 7mitigation ratios the following ratios shall apply to creation or restoration that is inkind is onsite is the same category is timed prior to or concurrent with alteration and has a high probability of success the first number specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second specifies the acreage of wetlands altered wetland mitigation ratios  enhancement rehabilitation creation category i    category ii    category iii    category iv   1 athe mitigation ratio is the acreage required for compensatory mitigation divided by the acreage of impact bthe ratios are for a concurrent compensatory mitigation project if the impacts to a wetland are to be mitigated by using an approved and established mitigation bank the rules and ratios applicable to the bank should be used cthe ratios are based on the assumption that the category based on wetland ratings established in dmmc  definition of wetland and hydrogeomorphic hgm classsubclass of the wetland proposed as compensation are the same as the category and hgm classsubclass of the wetland impacts dratios for projects in which the category and hgm classsubclass of wetlands proposed as compensation are not the same as that of the wetland impacts will be determined on a casebycase basis using the recommended ratios as a starting point the ratios could be higher in such cases ecreation can be used in combination with rehabilitation or enhancement for example two acres of impact to a category ii wetland would require two acres of creation ie replacing the lost acreage at a  ratio and eight acres of rehabilitation or 16 acres of enhancement fgenerally the use of enhancement alone as compensation is discouraged using enhancement in combination with some amount of creation is preferred 8preservation impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation restoration or enhancement preservation may also be used by itself but more restrictions apply as outlined below aacceptable uses of preservation the preservation of atrisk high quality wetlands and habitat may be considered as part of an acceptable mitigation plan when the following criteria are met ipreservation is used as a form of compensation only after the standard sequencing of mitigation avoid minimize and then compensate see subsection 2 of this section  iirestoration reestablishment and rehabilitation creation and enhancement opportunities have also been considered and preservation is proposed by the applicant and approved by the permitting agencies as the best compensation option  iiithe preservation site is determined to be under imminent threat  that is the site has the potential to experience a high rate of undesirable ecological change due to onsite or offsite activities that are not regulated eg logging of forested wetlands this potential includes permitted planned or likely actions  ivthe area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location some of the following features may be indicative of high quality sites acategory i or ii wetland rating  brare or

shall range from  to  as determined on a casebycase basis depending on the quality of the wetlands being impacted and the quality of the wetlands being preserved cpreservation as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts preservation alone shall only be used as compensatory mitigation in exceptional circumstances preservation alone shall not apply if impacts are occurring to functions that must be replaced onsite such as flood storage or water quality treatment that need to be replicated by water quality measures implemented within the project limits preservation of atrisk highquality wetlands and habitat as defined above may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met iall criteria listed in subsections 8a and 8b of this section are met  iithere are no adverse impacts to habitat for fish and species listed as endangered and threatened  iiithere is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin  ivhigher mitigation ratios are applied mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at  specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the

of unlisted uses and clarification of ambiguity 1in creating zones the city council has considered the characteristics of uses which make them comparable compatible or similar the city council recognizes that it is not possible to enumerate and classify every use to which land may be devoted either now or in the future and that ambiguity may exist with reference to the appropriate and consistent zone of a use therefore awhen any known and identifiable use is not listed as a permissible use in any zone  or bwhen any use has now come into existence by reason of any technical development in the trades sciences and equipment  or cwhen any use already listed in the zone which because of any process equipment or materials used possesses different performance standards than those which are usually associated with the uses in the zone as presently classified and which therefore makes it reasonable that such a use should be placed in the more restrictive zone 2it shall be the responsibility and duty of the planning building and public works department to ascertain all pertinent facts relating to any such use and make what it deems to be the appropriate recommendation for zoning any proceedings under this section shall be processed as an amendment   uncertainty of boundaries where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone shown upon the zoning map or any part or unit thereof the following rules shall apply 1where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street or alley lines or lot lines such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries  2in the case of unsubdivided property and where a zone boundary divides such property the location of such boundaries unless the same are indicated by dimensions shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map  3where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned the area comprising such vacated street or alley shall acquire the zone of the property to which it reverts  4where a lot subdivided and recorded subsequent to the zoning of the area in which it is located becomes so placed that it is unequally bisected longitudinally by the boundary lines of different zones the zone boundary shall be considered as following the lot lines of the lot in such manner as to place the lot wholly in that zone which applies to the major portion of the lot  5where property abuts a lake river or body of water the zone shall extend to the inner harbor line and where no harbor line exists to a line which the corps of engineers would define as the line of navigability  6where a lot is equally bisected longitudinally by a zone boundary line the total lot shall acquire the most restrictive zone and the highest area requirement of the two zones involved  7where a lot is bisected by the boundary line between two zones and such boundary line parallels or approximately parallels the street on which such lot fronts the total area of such bisected lot shall acquire the same zone requirement as the front portion of the lot this provision shall not apply to   property not zoned any property which for any reason other than the fact that it is a

uses limitations on permitted uses hazardous waste and hazardous substances permissible floor area height required open spaces internal walkways  purpose of zone the purpose of this zone and its application is to provide for the location of and grouping of enterprises which may involve some onpremises retail service but with outside activities and display or fabrication assembling and service features including manufacturing and processing in limited degree and which uses if permitted to locate in strictly onpremises retail and service areas would introduce factors of heavy trucking and handling of materials that destroy the maximum service and attraction of strictly retail areas the uses enumerated in this zone are considered as having common or similar performance standards in that 1they are heavier in type than those uses permitted in the strictly commercial zones and yet are measurably lighter uses than those first permitted in the business park zones  2they do not attract nor depend upon individual and personal patron contact on the premises to the same degree as do uses in strictly retail and service areas but rather represent in part enterprises whose services are either performed away from the premises and throughout the metropolitan area or enterprises in which the manufacturing assembling processing or treating of products is not accessory or limited to products sold on the premises only as is required in retail and service areas  3they can more advantageously use the standard lot and street pattern than can strictly industrial uses  4they involve a greater handling of materials and commodities and more trucking than uses permitted in a strictly retail area but do not require large sites nor involve as much handling of materials and commodities or heavy trucking as uses first permitted in strictly industrial areas  5they are not as detrimentally affected by dispersal or separation from adjoining uses as are enterprises which are retail in nature and which need to be located in compact areas for convenient patron access  6they do not normally involve as intensive use of land as uses comprising retail shopping areas  7they frequently involve activities carried on outside of buildings  8by reason of technological processes equipment materials used outside activities or size or volume of products a given type of enterprise may under various
