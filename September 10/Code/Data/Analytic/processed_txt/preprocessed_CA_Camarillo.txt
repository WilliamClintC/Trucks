by city staff the city council originally enacted this chapter in 198 imposing a traffic mitigation fee program program b pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as originally adopted a computerized traffic modeling study was to be prepared in order to update the program c a computerized traffic modeling study study was prepared by the citys traffic engineering consultants and has been adopted by resolution of the city council d based upon the study and other evidence presented to the city council the city council has concluded as follows 1 all types of new development within the city will cause a burden on the citys circulation system as well as on certain portions of the adjacent county circulation system will contribute to a reduction in levels of service below those which currently exist will result in unacceptable traffic congestion and related adverse impacts and in some cases will result in traffic volumes that exceed the street capacity at acceptable levels of service  and 2 a failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will cause a reduction in levels of service unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and intersections traffic accidents air pollution noise and restrictions on access for emergency vehicles  and 3 in the absence of this program imposing a fair share traffic mitigation fee upon new development existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fully fund the circulation system improvements necessary to avoid a reduction in levels of service and unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts  and 4 all types of new development in the city will directly benefit from circulation system improvements  and 5 it is necessary to impose a traffic mitigation fee fee on all types of new development within the city in an amount equal to the new developments share of needed traffic improvements  and 6 the public interest convenience and necessity require the adoption and implementation of the provisions of this program  1993  part 1989   purpose a the adoption of this chapter will raise additional revenues for construction of necessary circulation system improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by development of land within the city consistent with the camarillo general plan b this chapter contains a fair and equitable method of determining the extent to which the development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and establishes a fair and equitable method for distribution of unfunded costs of circulation system improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development c this chapter and the actions taken pursuant to its terms are necessary to assure that development takes place in a manner consistent with the citys general plan d this chapter and the actions taken pursuant to its terms are necessary to provide a fair and equitable method of mitigating the significant cumulative environmental impacts of traffic generated by development within the city this chapter shall not preclude the imposition of additional mitigation measures to address significant direct impacts of any development or to address otherwise unfunded roadway improvements nor shall this chapter preclude the city from adopting statements of overriding considerations where desirable and appropriate or from denying any discretionary development based on traffic impacts  part 1989   definitions a development means any discretionary or ministerial action by the city resulting in the issuance of grading building plumbing mechanical or electrical permits conditional use permits other land use entitlement permits or certificates of occupancy issued by the city to construct change or make lawful the use of a building or property b future growth means the level of new development anticipated in camarillo consistent with the general plan and shall be expressed in terms of square footage for commercial and industrial uses and in terms of dwelling units for residential uses c level of service means the different operating conditions which occur at an intersection or on a roadway when accommodating various traffic volumes it is a qualitative measure of the effect of traffic flow factors such as speed and travel time interruptions freedom to maneuver and driver comfort and convenience d nexus routine means the computerized accounting program developed by the citys traffic engineering consultant and adopted by resolution of the city council which traces trip ends from each category of land use of new development to a traffic impact excluding passby trips and then determines the pro rata share of each impact attributable to the new development e passby trip means a trip end that is actually a stopping off point along a trip on the way to another destination passby trips are not included in the calculation of traffic mitigation fees f roadway improvements means those improvements necessary to implement the traffic circulation improvement plan including but not limited to paving grading roadway substructure curb and gutter sidewalks medians with landscaping drainage facilities bridges traffic signals street lighting signing striping noise walls utility relocations rightsofway and other improvements or actions necessary to mitigate adverse environmental impacts g traffic circulation improvement plan means the program for maintaining and upgrading the citys traffic circulation system consistent with the general plan the plan will contain the improvements necessary to construct the traffic circulation system and all estimated associated costs including by way of example but not limited to engineering rightofway acquisitions and necessary legal fees the traffic circulation improvement plan shall be adopted by resolution of the city council and shall be revised as necessary h trip means a onedirection vehicular movement with an origin destination and no stops in between i trip end means the beginning or ending point of a trip  1993  part 1989   establishment of traffic mitigation fee a applicability the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new development which will generate additional vehicle trips b basis of fee a traffic mitigation fee shall be based upon the unfunded roadway improvement costs attributable to new development and the number of trips attributable to new development in each traffic mitigation fee district the resultant traffic mitigation fee for each category of new development in each traffic mitigation fee district shall be adopted by resolution of the city council c calculation traffic mitigation fees will be calculated in accordance with the following procedures 1 the unfunded traffic improvement costs shall be determined as follows a the computerized traffic modeling study shall be used to identify future traffic volumes and the resulting future traffic impacts based on the buildout of the citys general plan b a traffic circulation improvement plan shall be established by resolution of the city council for the purpose of mitigating the traffic impacts identified by the computerized traffic modeling study c an estimate shall be made of the costs associated with the traffic circulation improvement plan d an estimate shall be made of the current and anticipated funding available to finance the improvements identified in the traffic circulation improvement plan e a determination shall be made of the difference if any between the estimated costs and estimated funding f the extent to which the estimated cost exceeds the estimated funding will be the unfunded costs of the improvements to be funded by the traffic mitigation fee  2 traffic mitigation fee districts districts shall be established by resolution of the city council based on geographic areas within the city where new development generally impacts the same locations  3 the nexus routine shall be used to determine the share of each impact caused by each new development in each district  4 the unfunded traffic improvement costs for each improvement will then be distributed to each land use category of new development in each district in accordance with the same pro rata share developed by the nexus routine in determining the percentage of impact attributable to that land use category of new development  5 new mixed use buildings where there are multiple uses within a new building mixed use building the following shall apply a for each new mixed use building where there

the need for a new police facility within the city in november 198 the city was presented with a report by steinmann grayson smylie on the need for new police facilities and staffing needs for the camarillo police department year 2005 the report this report was updated by the planning collective limited in september 1989 the update b the report and the update indicate that there has been a steady increase for police service calls resulting in a demand for increased space and additional staff to ensure that the police functions can be carried out in a responsible manner based on the projected growth for the city year 200 the police facility located on palm drive has been determined to be inadequate in size and structure and it has been determined that there will be a need to increase staff size therefore the establishment of a new police facility and the imposition of a fee on new development to fund that portion of the new police facility and the imposition of a fee on new development to fund that portion of the new police facility attributable to new development is necessary in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the present and future citizens of camarillo and those who work and will work in the city c the update recommends that the city acquire at least four acres and construct a facility of approximately twentytwo thousand eight hundred gross square feet including an emergency operating center with parking for approximately one hundred twentyfive to one hundred fifty vehicles within the flynn road industrial area d the city council has examined and generally concurs with the recommendations of the report as modified by the update based upon the report the update and the options available for development of a new police facility in the near future the city council has selected and purchased an alternate site near flynn road which consists of an existing building of approximately twentyseven thousand seven hundred square feet with one hundred eighty parking spaces the city council has retained an architectural firm to redesign the building to serve as a police facility including an emergency operating center e the city council has determined that in order to build the police facility in a timely manner it is necessary to finance new developments share of the costs as financing will result in an additional monetary expenditure which increases the cost of the police facility the city council has determined that it is proper to include the financing costs of the portion attributable to new development in the fee f camarillo contracts with the ventura county sheriffs department for police services  part 1993  part 1989   police facility fee a there shall be a police facility fee imposed on all new industrial commercial and residential development in the city in an amount to be determined by a resolution duly adopted by the city council b the resolution setting forth the police facility fee shall take into account the portion of the new police facility attributable to new development the distribution of police calls to the various types of land uses and the total cost of the new police facility including acquisition redesign construction and financing costs c the police facility fee shall be used solely to pay for that portion of the costs attributable to new development for acquiring redesigning and constructing the new police facility in the city including financing costs d it is reasonable to impose a police facility fee on all new development in the city as all new development places an increased burden on police services and causes a need for increased staff and increased space and all new development benefits from adequate police service e it is reasonable to include the amount of financing the new police facility in the police facility fee as it would be impossible to establish a new police facility prior to building out of the existing general plan without financing such facility and absent such financing police service would become inadequate in the interim causing a detriment to the public health safety and welfare of those who live and work in the city  part 1993  part 1989   payment of police facility fee except as otherwise provided by law the police facility fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of any building permit  part 1993  part 1989   waiver the city council may waive all or part of the police facility fee for low and moderate income housing upon the request of the developer  part 1993  part 1989 fire protection facilities fee   purpose new construction within the city will create a need for additional fire protection services and a corresponding need for additional or enlarged fire stations from which to provide those services the ventura county fire protection district which provides fire protection services to the city has primary responsibility for providing the additional fire protection services but its tax revenues are insufficient to provide the corresponding additional or enlarged fire stations and it is questionable whether the fire district has authority to directly impose a fee on new construction for such purposes the city does have authority to impose such a fee and it is in the interest of the city to ensure that the fire district has sufficient funds to pay for the needed new or enlarged fire stations the purpose of this chapter is to impose on new construction within the city and to transfer to the fire district a fee in an amount sufficient to reimburse the fire district for that new constructions estimated pro rata share of the cost to the fire district of providing the additional or enlarged fire stations  part 1992   definitions for the purposes of this chapter the following
