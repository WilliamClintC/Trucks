site plan shall reflect all township plans and policies affecting the site including neighborhood plans key area plans master concept plans or previously adopted planned unit development plans  and 2 the site plan should be consistent with the statement of intent for the zoning district in which it is located or proposed b site planningopen space and green areas 1 to the extent possible the natural topographic and significant landscape features of the site shall be incorporated into the development in order to preserve the sites natural resources and enhance its visual character  274 2 where appropriate the design of green areas should incorporate plant materials to define space provide screening and privacy define views serve as focal points and soften views of buildings and pavement c grading and drainage 1 grading should be performed with sensitivity to existing topography and other natural resources on the site and on adjacent sites to the extent practicable grading

that they are necessary to preserve safety andor the trafficcarrying capacity of the existing street b the township may require a traffic impact study if one or more of the following conditions exist  if the proposed development or redevelopment may increase the number of trips entering or leaving the property by ten percent or more  if the proposed development or redevelopment may adversely change the type of traffic generated within the property for example addition of truck traffic  275  the scale or use of the proposed development might cause deterioration of service levels on the street andor deterioration of safety or service levels at intersections in the vicinity  the proposed development is in the vicinity of a street or intersection with a history of safety andor accident problems  and  the geometry of existing or proposed improvement might cause a safety hazard 4 site distance triangles a all sites shall be designed so that plants and structures on the site do not interfere with the safe movement of motor vehicle traffic bicycles or pedestrians b the site distance triangle should be determined in accordance with the most recent relevant and applicable standards

efficient pedestrian system shall be clearly designated f lighting 1 on site exterior lighting should provide illumination adequate to permit safe nighttime activities 2 all roadway parking lot and walkway lights shall be shielded so that substantially all the directly emitted light falls within the property line g buffer yards 1 the purpose of a buffer yard is to minimize friction between noncompatible land uses and to protect the public health and safety reduction of air noise and visual pollution the amount and type of screening material required shall be based on the intensity of the proposed land use 276 2 where vegetative andor topographic conditions that provide a natural screening and buffer exist before development of properties in question every effort shall be made to
