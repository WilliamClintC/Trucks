has been presented by the applicant to demonstrate that the flow and character of the wastewater is compatible with the proper operation of the plant and sewers and that the proposed wastewater will not alone or in combination with other wastes cause a violation of the discharge permit pass plant without treatment interfere or otherwise disrupt the proper quality and disposal of plant sludge or be injurious in any other manner to the plant or sewers and that there is sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the strength and volume of the proposed development  c the proposed use of wastewater capacity complies with the allocation priorities and principles and is not in conflict with any other enactment adopted by the board or municipality  15220 conditions of preliminary connection approval a the board after making the approval findings above may issue a preliminary connection approval which approval shall be a binding commitment of capacity to the project contingent

fulfilled shall issue the final connection approval permit which approval may be conditioned as follows 1 the permit shall specify the allowed volume flow rate strength frequency and any other characteristics of the proposed discharge determined appropriate by the board 2 the capacity allocation is not transferable to any other person or project unless requested by the original owner and

practice in a manner acceptable to the board 4 capacity allocated in conjunction with the final connection permit for building development shall revert to the town of hartford if the permit recipient has failed to initiate construction within one year of the issued date on the permit b the permit shall expire two years from the date of issuance based on the original development plan at the time of permit approval within the twoyear period a revised development plan and connection application may be approved by the board in the same manner as the original such revised plans must also be approved under local bylaws and by the applicable state laws and regulations if the board approves an amended development plan and connection application it will issue a revised final connection permit with reduced or increased capacity allocation determined in accord with the allocation priorities and principles where reduced capacity is granted in a revised connection permit the capacity will revert to the town of hartford and the town of hartford may pay to the applicant a proportional refund of connection or impact fees regardless of any revised development plans approved by the board the board shall not approve an extension of the original twoyear expiration period after two years the unused portion of the committed capacity allocation will revert to the town of hartford and there will be

regardless of the permit expiration period above the board may order construction of the development over a longer period if this action is in the municipalitys best interests  15222 transfer of allocation a initially reserve capacity is allocated by the board to a specific person project and parcel of land the allocation is not made solely to a parcel of land and therefore does not run with the land during project completion after completion of the project or permit expiration however the allocation adjusted to the actual development constructed if necessary will run with the land b the transfer of the capacity allocation is prohibited unless approved in writing by the board at the original owners request c the board may approve transfer of capacity from one project to another and one owner to another provided that the new project and owner meets all the requirements for the final connection approval originally issued and the original owner requests such transfer  15223
