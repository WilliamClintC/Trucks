actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  exh a  4 2018  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of cmc   and  have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in cmc  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of monterey recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  exh a  4 2018  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the

emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will

various measurements referenced in this title are to be calculated b general provisions 1 applicant responsibility for all calculations the applicant shall be responsible for supplying drawings illustrating the measurements these drawings shall be drawn to scale and shall be of sufficient detail to allow easy verification upon inspection by the director 2 fractions when calculations result in fractions the results will be rounded as follows a minimum requirements when a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement any fractional result will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number for example if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 30 lineal feet is applied to a 50foot strip the resulting fraction of 137 is rounded up to two required trees b maximum limits when a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole number for example if a maximum floor area limit for guesthouse is applied to a 7500squarefoot lot the resulting number of 4225 is rounded down to 422 allowed square feet 3 measuring distances distances shall be measured as follows a distances are measured horizontally when determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line edge of building structure storage area parking area or other object these distances are not measured by following the topography or slope of the land b measurements are shortest distance when measuring a required distance such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line the measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two objects exceptions are stated in subsection b3c of this section c measurement of vehicle stacking or travel areas the minimum travel distance for vehicles such as a garageentrance setback is measured down the center of the vehicle travel area for example curving driveways are measured along the center arc of the driveway c required area for a building site 1 existing buildings the ground area needed for legal construction of a building at the time of construction shall be one building site if the building could not be legally built on the same ground area at the present time the building site shall be called a nonconforming building site 2 vacant land the land area required by the standards in the base zoning districts shall be a legal building site if the land area is a legal lot of record or if the land area was legally reconfigured in conformance with the subdivision map act of the state and the provisions for subdivision or lot line adjustments established in cmc subdivisions and lot line adjustments 3 multiple one building site the ground area of a building site may be comprised of more than one lot the ground area of more than one lot may be required by existing or proposed buildings on a site pursuant to cmc b each building site must retain a ground area and setbacks consistent with all provisions of this code each building site must be composed of original lots of record or composed of new lots legally reconfigured from original lots in conformance with the subdivision map act of the state and the provisions for subdivision or lot line adjustments established in the municipal code d determining buildable area for the purposes of calculating allowable building volume and floor area the buildable area of a lot shall be the lot area minus the following 1 continuous portions of the site occupying at least 10 percent of the site area with a slope greater than 30 percent eg see steep slope areas in figure i2 2 the pole of a flag lot  3 private access roads  4 those portions of a site qualifying as environmentally sensitive habitat areas esha as provided for in of cmc environmentally sensitive habitat area overlay district  and 5 scenic habitat coastal access or conservation easements figure i2 buildable area e average slope 1 average slope the average slope of a lot is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the sum by the average distance between the two lot lines the average elevation of the uphill or downhill lot line is calculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two 2 average percent of slope the ratio between vertical and horizontal distances expressed in percent the mathematical expression of which is based upon the formula below vertical distance x 100   average percent slope horizontal distance figure i3 average slope f grades existing grade is the set of elevations representing the surface of the ground prior to grading filling or other site alterations for a project on developed sites as each topographic line passes beneath a building it shall be assumed to be a straight and level line for purposes of defining existing grade existing grade may also be referred to as natural grade see figure i4 on sites disturbed from previous grading or excavation activities an approximation of preexisting conditions may be used as a reference for determining average or existing grade using grades on adjacent sites retaining walls and prior survey maps all such grade approximations shall require the concurrence of the department and a determination that the resulting project complies with all requirements of the zoning avoids large exposed cuts and unnatural topography and is consistent with r1 design objectives average grade is a horizontal line approximating the ground elevation building on a site used for calculating the exterior volumes of buildings average grade is calculated separately for each building average grade is calculated in four steps 1 plot the ground level perimeter of the building on a topographic map of the site using onefoot contour intervals assign an elevation of zero for the lowest contour line that passes building perimeter 2 for each contour line that intersects the building perimeter draw a straight line building that connects the point of intersection to where the same contour line emerges from the building perimeter see figure i4 below 3 for each line drawn in step 2 multiply its length by its elevation above the zero contour line and then sum all results 4 divide the sum from step 3 by the sum of the lengths of all lines drawn the resulting elevation above the zero contour line is extended as a horizontal line building as average grade figure i4 existing grade g exterior volume the maximum allowable exterior volume is calculated by multiplying a volume factor in cmc c by the allowed base floor area subject to the following 1 exterior volume is expressed in cubic feet and is measured from the exterior wall and roof surfaces of each building the exterior volume of the building shall be based on the height of the exterior walls above both the average existing grade and the average final grade where the average grade line lies below a building the exterior walls of the building are projected down to average grade to calculate its volume portions of a building located below average grade are excluded from exterior volume 2 exterior volume includes all dwellings guesthouses accessory dwelling units garages carports chimneys storage sheds projecting windows and covered porches 3 exterior volume also includes the volumes in and under any attached or freestanding arbor or trellis and under that portion of any roof eave extending more than 18 inches from the face of any building 4 decks or balconies with a walking surface more than three feet above final grade shall count as exterior volume as measured from the deck surface to the top of any rail or enclosing wall any deck or balcony with a floor level less than three feet above final grade will be excluded from the volume total figure i5 determining exterior volume h determining base floor area the maximum allowable base floor area shall be calculated by multiplying the buildable area of the lot by the maximum percentage presented in the development standards for each zone i determining floor area ratio the floor area ratio shall be expressed as percentage of the buildable area of the parcel of land upon which the building rests for aboveground spaces floor area is measured at the exterior of the enclosing walls for basement spaces floor area is measured at the interior of the enclosing walls j resubdivided corner corner lots are those created lot line adjustment by reorienting a lot line 90 degrees running between two adjacent original lots of record one of which is located at the corner of a block and the other is adjacent to the corner lot and fronting on the same street each lot created by this action is considered a resubdivided corner lot for purposes of establishing front setbacks k determining lot coverage the total ground area of a lot occupied by materials or improvements that cover the natural soil but which are outside the perimeter of structures that count as floor area lot coverage includes 1 fully permeable materials including gravel spaced decking and exterior stairs however shredded bark wood chips and similar materials used as mulch within fully landscaped areas are not counted as lot coverage  2 semipermeable materials including sandset bricks or pavers garden walkways of small paving stones and arbors  and 3 impermeable materials including asphalt concrete decomposed granite mortared brick and stone unspaced decking and balconies at any level garden walls solariums bridges sheds not counted as floor area ponds hot tubs and swimming pools l measuring height 1 measuring building height the height of buildings shall be measured as the plumb vertical distance from existing or finished grade whichever is more restrictive to the highest point on the roof a flat roof the measurement is made to the highest point of the roof beams of the roof b mansard roof the measurement is made to the deck line of the roof c pitched or hipped roof the measurement is made to the peak

purpose of this chapter is to establish standards and requirements for physical development in the r1 singlefamily residential district to implement the general plan and the coastal land use plan the following design objectives for the r1 district are established a the urban forest site improvements and the public rightofway should be designed to preserve significant trees and to perpetuate the established urban forest in each neighborhood where it exists each site should contribute to the urban forest or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood by harboring an appropriate number and mix of trees andor shrubs consistent with the neighborhood context and the neighborhood streetscape b neighborhood design each site shall contribute to neighborhood character including the type of forest resources present the character of the street the response to local topography and the treatment of open space resources such as setbacks and landscaping it is intended by this objective that diversity in architecture be encouraged while preserving the broader elements of community design that characterize the streetscape within each neighborhood c site design good site design is essential to good building design site improvements shall be compatible with and sensitive to the natural features and built environment of the site and of the surrounding area design solutions should relate to and take advantage of site topography vegetation and slope designs shall recognize the limitations of the land and work with these limitations rather than ignoring them or trying to override them d mass and bulk residential designs shall maintain carmels enduring principles of modesty and simplicity and preserve the citys tradition of simple homes set amidst a forest landscape buildings shall not present excess visual mass or bulk to public view or to adjoining properties large boxlike buildings and buildings with large continuous unrelieved surfaces can appear massive designing building and roof planes with just a few simple forms and keeping floor levels and plate heights close to grade help reduce mass and bulk the use of natural materials such as wood or stone and the creative use of landscaping can also help to avoid excess mass by introducing texture variety and screening e scale buildings shall relate to a human scale in their forms elements and in the detailing of doors windows roofs and walkways oversized design elements make structures appear dominating and monumental this outofscale character represents a poor fit to the human form vitiates the more intimate rural charm and village character of carmelbythesea and shall be avoided f boxedin neighbors designs should preserve reasonable access to light air and open space for surrounding properties when considered cumulatively with other buildings in the neighborhood designs incorporating tall or bulky building elements located near an adjoining site that is already partially boxedin by previous development should be avoided g privacy designs should respect the privacy of neighbors the placement of windows doors balconies and decks should be sensitive to similar improvements on neighboring properties h open space the design of structures shall be coordinated with open space to enhance the parklike environment of the city open space should be distributed around buildings to provide visual relief from structural bulk and a distinct separation from buildings on adjacent sites open space is a shared community resource and some front yard open space on each site should remain visible from the street when this is consistent with the context established by neighboring sites i landscaping designs should coordinate structural elements with landscaping to achieve a pleasing overall site design landscaped open space onsite can help enhance the urban forest or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood by coordinating with open space on neighboring sites and roadside vegetation landscaping also can aid in achieving other design objectives such as breaking up mass and bulk and protecting privacy but such use of landscaping should not substitute for good building design j public views buildings shall be located and designed to preserve significant coastal views from the public rightofway in conformance with of the california coastal act the protection of public views should not prevent reasonable development of the site yet development shall not preclude reasonable protection of any significant coastal view k private views designs should respect views enjoyed by neighboring parcels this objective is intended to balance the private rights to views from all parcels that will be affected by a proposed building or addition no single parcel should enjoy a greater right than other parcels except the natural advantages of each sites topography buildings which substantially eliminate an existing significant view enjoyed on another parcel should be avoided l solar access designs should preserve the rights to reasonable solar access on neighboring parcels excessively tall buildings particularly those near a north property line which would block the free passage of the sun onto neighboring solar collectors or southfacing windows on neighboring sites should be avoided m equity design controls and conditions of approval should be reasonable and fair  2004

predominantly a residential city with a unique commercial and multifamily residential area noted for its village character this character arises from the variety in building designs and their modest scale from the prevalence of contiguous street facades punctuated by frequent courtyards and from the employment of open space and landscaping as a setting for the mix of apartments and shops within the commercial district most structures built prior to 1940 consist of twostory reinforced concrete or wood frame buildings in a variety of architectural styles the oldest buildings in the district although remodeled retain features associated with the italianate and other commercial styles typical of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century american main street vernacular these include second story bay windows doublehung sash windows remnants of board and batten and tongue and groove siding quoins and paneled and glazed doors however it was the construction that took place under the influence of the spanish colonial and tudor architectural revivals of the 1920s that left the most lasting imprint on the character of the business district tudor motifs of halftimbering grouped rectangular windows ornate brick work oriel and bay windows and complex roofs with multiple gables are interspersed among the spanish stylistic trademarks of plaster exteriors and tiled roofs of arcades of ornate wrought iron and carved wood detailing of colorful glazed tile for staircase risers for dados fountains planters and backsplashes and for patios and courtyards this tradition of architectural diversity enhances the character of the commercial district and adds a lively sense of history to carmels village ambiance designs for new buildings and modifications to existing buildings should respect this tradition and historical context the city has consciously chosen architectural eclecticism and encourages originality and invention so long as the results encompass the unifying values of human scale and the use of natural materials and their role in preserving village character  2004   2004  design review and the basic review standard in order to protect the unique

story andor taller than 18 feet in height  d projects involving construction of a new dwelling unit or demolition of an existing dwelling unit  and e projects that in the opinion of the director of community planning and building represents a substantial deviation from standard design and construction practices in the neighborhood and is not addressed by these regulations or which otherwise may be inconsistent with the purposes of this district or the general plan  2004   2004  review criteria proposed projects requiring planning commission review as established in cmc  shall require approval track two design study process see cmc design review using the following standards prior to the issuance of any building permits a projects exceeding the limits on number of stories andor height the planning commission may grant approval of 1 a second story  2 an increase in building height up to a maximum of 24 feet  and 3 approvals granted under this section shall not violate any height limits established for the property by the underlying zoning district or any other overlay districts in granting approval for these increases the commission shall make the following findings a that due to the topography of the site relative to the adjoining park or open space land the proposed building would not exceed the height or bulk of an 18foot onestory structure built on a site at the same grade as the adjoining park or that topography and height are irrelevant because of the location of the building on the site avoids view of the buildings from the park b that those portions of the building visible from the park will exhibit a human scale and residential character use of simple building forms and natural materials that will not detract from the enjoyment of the park or open space by the public b projects requiring modified setback standards through the track two design study process the planning commission may approve an adjustment of setbacks on park overlay district properties from those normally required in order to preserve equity in the amount of buildable area on a lot after application of the 15foot setback from park boundaries required by cmc  minimum standards sites with a side lot line adjacent to parklands that cannot obtain a satisfactory modification of setbacks procedure may apply for a variance to reduce the width of the 15foot setback from the park boundary in granting requests for modified setbacks the planning commission shall make the findings listed below 1 that the total area of all setbacks is approximately equal to the area of the lot that would be contained in setbacks if the increased setback from the park established in cmc  minimum standards were applied 2 that a minimum width of at least three feet will be maintained for the full length of all setbacks 3 that by reducing any setbacks the proposed structure will not interfere with safe access to other properties in the neighborhood or otherwise result in damage or injury to the use of other adjoining properties 4 that structures proposed for construction within reduced setback areas will be compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood and will exhibit a human scale without excessive building bulk or visual mass c projects on irregularly shaped than 8000 square feet on those lots that are irregular in shape or that exceed 8000 square feet in area the planning commission shall establish setbacks that are appropriate for the property and that are consistent with the purposes of the po district where a large lot size creates an opportunity to establish significantly increased setbacks from adjoining parklands and the topography or shape of the site allow sufficient area to build away from the park the planning commission may designate larger setbacks for the property that preserve an open space buffer adjacent to the park while providing a reasonable area to build elsewhere on the property d in designating these setbacks the commission must adopt the findings listed in subsection b of this section and the following findings 1 that the proposed setbacks afford maximum protection for the adjoining parklands for the benefit of the public while still accommodating reasonable development of the property 2 that the proposed setbacks are designated on an approved plan attached to the permit or on a scenic easement for purposes of documentation and recordation  2004   2004 beach and riparian overlay district  purpose the purpose of the beach and riparian overlay district is to provide review standards

exceptions it is recognized that some sites due to size shape topography existing buildings the availability of land suitable for parking purposes or location within specific land use districts may have difficulty meeting all parking requirements therefore the following exceptions are provided to increase the flexibility in meeting parking requirements a onsite parking in the central commercial cc land use district in contrast to the other districts within the city onsite parking is prohibited in the central commercial cc land use district this policy eliminates the need for curb cuts in sidewalks and the interference with free pedestrian traffic flow that would result from an excessive number of driveways this policy is also intended to enhance the opportunities for creating intrablock courts and walkways between properties and buildings b use of another site parking requirements may be fulfilled by supplying the required parking on another site upon approval of a use permit when use of another site for parking is authorized such parking shall be located within the commercial district on property permitting such use the land area required to provide such parking shall be legally committed for the full life of the structure for which the parking is required the legal commitment shall be of such a nature that it cannot be withdrawn for the life of the structure without the consent of the city applicants applying for approval of a use permit authorizing the use of another site for parking purposes must demonstrate one of the following conditions 1 the property owners of two or more adjacent properties have proposed a combined development plan to provide the required parking for their properties in accordance with the parking standards established in this chapter on part of the several sites involved 2 the project site for which the parking requirement applies is 5000 square feet or less in size and has less than 50 feet of street frontage 3 the construction of required driveways for onsite parking would result in the excessive loss of curb parking on street 4 the topography size shape or peculiar conditions of the site or the existing development on the site would make the provision of onsite parking impractical 5 the site for which parking is required is located within the central commercial cc land use district where onsite parking is prohibited c parking adjustment inlieu fees the planning commission may authorize the satisfaction of parking requirements granting of a use permit and the payment of inlieu fees when onsite parking is not practical or when onsite parking is prohibited by city policies parking adjustments shall not decrease the number of parking spaces required by this chapter the practicality of providing parking onsite shall be evaluated by using the criteria set forth in subsection b2 b4 of this section standards for participation in the inlieu fee program are established in cmc  parking inlieu fee program applicants for use permits authorizing the use of inlieu fees to adjust onsite parking shall also demonstrate both of the following 1 the parking for which the adjustment is sought is not required for serving hotel or motel uses 2 the applicant has diligently pursued meeting the parking requirements both onsite and offsite but has been unsuccessful in meeting the requirement or that the site is located within the central commercial cc land use district where onsite parking is prohibited  2004   2004  parking inlieu fee program when parking adjustments have been authorized by the planning commission in conformance with cmc c required parking may be satisfied by the payment to the city of inlieu fees funds collected by the city from such payments shall be deposited in a specific fund and used by the city to acquire andor develop offstreet parking such parking shall be available to the public and shall be in or near the business district of the city funds paid to the

site a payment of inlieu fees all inlieu parking fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the first permit any business license or building permit for which the inlieu fees are required with one exception the only exception arises when the number of inlieu parking spaces exceeds five in which case at least 40 percent of the total inlieu fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the project permit or license and the remaining balance shall accrue interest at the prime interest rate fixed on the date the first permit or license is issued any fees including interest that will be subject to such delayed payments shall be evidenced by a promissory note this promissory note shall provide for the payment of attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party and shall be secured by a deed of trust b determination of value of parking inlieu fees the amount to be charged for an inlieu parking space shall be determined by using the current construction costs of public garages having type i or type ii fire resistance and the regional modifier for the san francisco area as supplied by the building standards of the international conference of building officials and a factor representing land costs four hundred square feet shall be used as the necessary area for a car to park and have maneuvering room with ingress and egress the current construction costs per square foot shall be multiplied by the modifier to determine the cost per square foot to construct the parking space the cost of constructing the parking space shall then be increased by 50 percent to reflect land cost this total shall be the fee paid for each full inlieu parking space a fee reduction of 25 percent shall be allowed for parking spaces required for newly established residential dwelling units  2004

evaluated by the planning director or hisher designee for potential adverse impacts to water quality and applicants should consider site design source control and treatment control bmps in order to minimize polluted runoff and water quality impacts resulting from the development site design bmps reduce the need for source andor treatment control bmps and source control bmps may reduce the amount of treatment control bmps needed for a development therefore bmps should be incorporated into the project design in the following progression a site design bmps  b source control bmps  c treatment control bmps 2 all development shall be designed to minimize the introduction of pollutants that may result in water quality impacts projects should be designed to control postdevelopment peak runoff rates and average volumes to maintain or reduce predevelopment downstream erosion rates these objectives can be accomplished creation of a hydrologically functional project design that strives to mimic the existing natural hydrologic regime and by achieving the following goals a maintain and use existing natural drainage courses and vegetation  b conserve natural resources and areas by clustering development on the least environmentally sensitive portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural undisturbed condition  c minimize the amount of directly connected impervious surface and total area of impervious surface  d incorporate or connect to existing onsite retention and infiltration measures  e direct rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than driveways or impervious surfaces to reduce the amount of stormwater leaving the site  f minimize clearing and grading 3 incorporating these goals and principles into the project design will help to minimize the introduction of pollutants to the site and decrease the amount of polluted runoff leaving the site resulting in the overall objective of water quality protection appendix i to this chapter describes the requirements and processes for implementing bmps into development and provides examples of types of bmps to incorporate 4 nonstructural bmps are preventative actions that involve management and source controls such as protecting and restoring sensitive areas such as wetlands and riparian corridors maintaining andor increasing open space providing buffers along sensitive water bodies minimizing impervious surfaces and directly connected impervious areas and minimizing disturbance of soils and vegetation structural bmps include storage practices such as wet ponds and extendeddetention outlet structures  filtration practices such as grassed swales sand filters and filter strips  and infiltration practices such as infiltration basins and infiltration trenches in

manual 10 introduction 11 purpose this low impact development guidance manual manual is intended for use by project developers such as architects engineers and building contractors in designing and constructing projects within the city of carmelbythesea city to comply with the citys low impact development lid requirements city staff involved in reviewing plans and issuing permits for a project will use this manual to determine whether or not the project has been designed to meet these requirements 12 background discharges from the citys storm drainage system are regulated under a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit issued by the central coast regional water quality control board rwqcb of the state of california the initial npdes permit was called the general permit for the discharge of storm water from small municipal separate storm sewer systems order no 20030005dwq the city became subject to this permit on  the rwqcb periodically revises its overall storm drainage requirements and imposes them on dischargers by reissuing its general permit under a new order number or by issuing specific requirements to dischargers this low impact development guidance manual reflects the postconstruction stormwater management requirements for development projects in the central coast region adopted by the rwqcb on  these are referred to herein as the rwqcb postconstruction requirements a condition of compliance under the npdes permit is that the city implements its storm water management program one of the staterequired components of that program is to develop and implement a set of best management practices bmps to reduce storm water runoff and storm water pollution emanating from new development and redevelopment projects located within the city this is accomplished by using the lid concepts described in this manual during the design and construction of those projects lid is a development approach that 1 reduces the amount of storm water runoff by retaining a portion of the storm water on the project site where it can infiltrate into the ground or be released in a controlled manner and 2 in some instances reduces the amount of pollutants in storm water or manmade treatment processes so that these discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of receiving water quality standards established by the rwqcb 13 authority chapters 1710 1734 1742 1743 and 1770 of the carmelbythesea municipal cmc establish certain of the bmp requirements described in this manual for ease of reference citations from sections of these chapters are designated herein as xxxxxxx in addition on  the city council adopted a document titled bmp guidance series contained in appendix j to cmc as official city policies pertaining to storm water pollution prevention from new development and redevelopment projects requirements taken from that document are designated herein as bgs the city may from time to time update the bmp guidance series by revising or adding to the requirements contained in that document the city has adopted the requirements described in this manual to control the volume rate and potential pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation transport and discharge of pollutants as defined by of the cmc the city will incorporate these requirements into any construction or buildingrelated permit to be issued for the development or redevelopment  the purpose of the requirements in is to protect and enhance coastal waters within the city in accordance with the policies of the citys local coastal plan the california coastal act and the citys npdes permit requirements and to ensure that permitted development shall be sited and designed to conserve natural drainage features and vegetation minimize the introduction of pollutants into coastal waters to the maximum extent practicable limit the discharge of stormwater runoff and protect the overall quality of coastal waters and resources  14 lid bmp implementation tracking in order to facilitate the design review and permitting process when the plans for a project are submitted to the city they should include a completed copy of the bmp implementation tracking form contained in attachment 1 the plans should also show the locations of the bmps that have been incorporated into the design of the project 15 definitions the terms in this defined as they apply in this lid guidance manual hillside hillside means property located in an area with known erosive soil conditions where the development contemplates grading on any natural slope that is 25% or greater impermeable or impervious surface these terms are used interchangeably in this lid guidance manual impermeable surface is defined in of the citys municipal mean a surface artificially constructed so as to prevent or largely inhibit the infiltration of rainwater or runoff into the natural soils or underlying geologic materials impervious surface is defined in the rwqcbs postconstruction requirements to mean a hard nonvegetated surface area that prevents or significantly limits the entry of water into the soil mantle as would occur under natural conditions prior to development common imperviousimpermeable surfaces include but are not limited to roof tops walkways patios driveways parking lots or storage areas concrete or asphalt paving oiled macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of stormwater net impervious area the sum of new and replaced postproject impervious areas minus any reduction in total imperviousness from the preproject to postproject condition net impervious area   new and replaced impervious area  reduced impervious area credit where reduced impervious area credit is the total preproject to postproject reduction in impervious area if any new development land disturbing activities that include the construction or installation of buildings roads driveways and other impervious surfaces development projects with preexisting impervious surfaces are not considered new development permeable or pervious surface a surface that allows varying amounts of stormwater to infiltrate into the ground examples include pasture native vegetation areas landscape areas and permeable pavements designed to infiltrate permeable pavements include pavers which are set in sand so that water can percolate between the pavers such as those commonly used for patios walkways and driveways redevelopment on a site that has already been developed construction or installation of a building or other structure subject to the citys planning and building authority including 1 the creation or addition of impervious surfaces  2 the expansion of a building footprint or addition or replacement of a structure  or 3 structural development including construction installation or expansion of a building or other structure it does not include routine road maintenance nor does it include emergency construction activities required to immediately protect public health and safety regulated projects regulated projects include all new development or redevelopment projects that create andor replace >2500 square feet of impervious surface collectively over the entire project site steep slopes has the same meaning as hillside 16 exception discharges discharges of other than storm water to waters shall be effectively prohibited except for the following nonstorm water discharges which are not prohibited provided any pollutant discharges are identified and appropriate control measures to minimize the impacts of such discharges are developed and implemented this provision does not obviate the need to obtain any other appropriate permits for such discharges a water line flushing  b individual residential car washing  c diverted stream flows  d rising ground waters  e uncontaminated ground water

from landscaped areas as defined and in accordance with section b4 of this order discharges or flows from firefighting activities are excluded from the effective prohibition against nonstorm water and need only be addressed where they are identified as significant sources of pollutants to waters of the us if the city determines that any individual or class of nonstorm water discharges listed above may be a significant source of pollutants to waters of the us or poses a threat to water quality standards beneficial uses the city may require the discharger to monitor and submit a report and to

excluded from these volume and flowbased numerical treatment control bmp design standards the term treatment includes physical biological and chemical processes such as filtration the use of bioswales detention and retention ponds and adsorption media the actual type of treatment should be suited to the pollutants generated by the development as indicated in table 1 of attachment 3 descriptions of commonly used treatment control bmps are contained in attachment 2 detailed design information for treatment control bmps and examples can be found in of the casqa handbook and in appendices c of the santa barbara manual both of which are described in of this manual at its discretion and for good cause the city may waive one or more of the requirements pertaining to treatment control bmps if impracticability for a specific property can be established a waiver of impracticability will be granted only when all other treatment control bmps have been considered and rejected as infeasible recognized potential situations of impracticability may include i extreme limitations of space for treatment on a project site ii unfavorable or unstable soil conditions making a site unsuitable for infiltration and iii risk of ground water contamination because a known unconfined aquifer lies beneath the land surface or an existing or potential underground source of drinking water is less than 10 feet from the soil surface a waiver may be revoked for cause and with proper notice a waiver of requirements may be subject to prior approval by the rwqcb depending on the type of requirement being waived 22 watercourse protection watercourses located on private property are required to be kept free of trash debris excessive vegetation stagnant pools of water and other obstacles that would pollute contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water watercourse to the extent required by the city healthy bank vegetation should not be removed beyond that actually necessary for

areas and wetlands maintaining invertstreambeds to maximize capacity and providing vegetated setbacks or buffer strips outside of the maximum water surface level 2 conserve natural resources and areas by clustering development on the least environmentally sensitive portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural undisturbed condition 3 protect slopes and channels from eroding and

impervious pavement pavers are recommended for driveways walkways and patios in singlefamily residences if ada requirements do not have to be met in nonresidential areas pavers are recommended for emergency access roads overflow parking areas and nonhandicapped parking stalls keeping in mind that some types of alternate paving materials may not be suitable where heavy loads such as trucks 11 in new residential areas reduce street width by eliminating onstreet parking where such actions do not pose a safety hazard in addition to reducing the impervious area this control has the added benefit of removing cars from streets and making street sweeping easier and more effective if onstreet parking in residential areas is eliminated the developer must provide adequate offstreet visitor parking 12 if alleys are included in a proposed development width should be minimized or alternate paving materials should be used 13 provide green areas in new residential developments where people can walk their pets and keep pet excrement away from sidewalks and streets where it may contribute to storm water pollution 14 install landscaping or other cover materials to minimize erosion from graded surfaces promote the use of natural vegetation by using parking lot islands and other landscaped areas use of native plant materials is recommended because native plants require less maintenance and

development and redevelopment sites to capture and treat the polluted runoff before it enters the citys storm drain system or other receiving waters many of these are included in table 3 of attachment 3 when site design and source control bmps alone are inadequate to fulfill the citys storm water pollution prevention requirements for a proposed project treatment control bmps which are feasible for the proposed development should be incorporated into its design treatment controls must be designed such that volumes and flows in excess of the design rainfall event bypass the unit otherwise there is the possibility of aggravating flooding and also causing resuspension of previously captured sediments or other constituents also all of the treatment bmps described below require some inspection maintenance and disposal of solids to ensure optimum performance and often to avoid flooding 1 rooftop catchment systems  these are rooftops which can sometimes be designed into large commercial and industrial sites to pool stormwater which following the storm evaporates this effectively eliminates rooftop runoff from the storm drain system and thereby reduces the hydraulicallyconnected impervious area another function of these systems is to slow down the runoff to reduce peaks problems with rooftop catchment systems are mainly related to leakage 2 vegetated filter strips  vegetated filter strips buffer strips or riparian buffer zones are strips of vegetation placed between receiving waters eg along streams and pollutant sources the effectiveness of the strips depends primarily on the width of the strip and the vegetation type and condition strips of 100300 feet in width are often considered such strips have been successfully applied to urban agricultural and forestry situations vegetation type selection must take into account the climate and usually should be droughtresistant maintenance is primarily annual cutting such strips are recommended for developments located along receiving waters such as streams rivers and lakes but outside the flood control boundary 3 vegetated swales  swales are shallow low gradient channels that are vegetated they are commonly applied in rural residential areas in lieu of traditional curbgutters and underground stormwater drainage pipes water quality improvement is achieved primarily performance is dependent on the swale hydraulic capacity and vegetation type and condition influent water should be relatively free of coarse sediment to avoid burying the vegetation where sediment loads are of concern sediment settling basins can be provided upstream of the swales maintenance consists primarily of vegetation management and settling basin cleanouts swales are generally recommended for lowdensity residential developments located in relatively flat terrain 4 infiltration basins  infiltration basins store and infiltrate stormwater into the surficial groundwater aquifer performance is critically dependent on soil porosity and adequate depth to groundwater such conditions are typical of inland valleys in contrast to low lying coastal areas in order to maintain recharge rates influent water may require pretreatment to remove sediments infiltration basins are effective at reducing runoff rates and volumes and can provide water supply benefits recharge maintenance primarily consists of periodic removal of accumulated trash debris and sediments to maintain recharge rates infiltration basins are generally recommended in areas where the depth to groundwater is relatively high and the soils are highly pervious where such conditions exist this technology is generally applicable to the entire range of urban development although the potential for groundwater contamination is often of concern in industrial areas 5 infiltration trenches  infiltration trenches are shallow drains filled with high porosity materials eg gravel stormwater discharged to these trenches is stored during the runoff event and infiltrates into the groundwater during dry weather periods as with infiltration basins performance requires porous subsoils and adequate depth to the groundwater table the acceptability and designs of infiltration trenches must take into consideration the potential for infiltrating water to adversely affect soil strength around foundations infiltration trenches are generally not recommended for roof runoff near buildings because of building code requirements  but can be effective as part of the overall open channel drainage system 6 dry detention pondsbasins  these are basins designed to temporarily store and treat storm water prior to gradually releasing it downstream such basins can provide flood control and storm water treatment benefits treatment performance depends on storage volume 1224 hours of residence time is considered a good rule of thumb and good circulation avoidance of short circuiting a major factor limiting good performance is that during larger storm runoff events water entering a dry basin may resuspend previously settled material in which case the ponds may act as a source of sediment and associated chemicals in general dry basins are not as effective as wet basins discussed below however in certain arid areas wet basins are not feasible performance of dry basins can be improved by incorporating slow release outlet structures such basins are generally applicable to residential commercial and industrial development in areas where there is insufficient runoff to maintain wet basins 7 retention pondswet basins  these are basins that contain a permanent pool of water such ponds can provide flood control ecological and water quality benefits the performance of wet basins depends on the size of the basin watershed characteristics and influent conditions the primary treatment process in retention ponds is settling maintenance is required for removing debris vegetation management and maintaining the inlet and outlet structures accumulation rates in such basins typically require that accumulated sediment be removed about once every 1020 years retention ponds are generally applicable to most urban situations as long as there is adequate space for the facility and acceptable geological conditions 8 constructedrestored wetlands  in addition to providing flood control and water supply benefits recharge of groundwater constructed wetlands designed for stormwater management provide water quality benefits number of processes including sedimentation filtration absorption biological processes and nutrient uptake pollutant removal performance depends on the size of the wetland relative to the watershed the design of the wetland and the type and composition of wetland vegetation wetlands also provide additional ecological and recreational benefits if a significant amount of sedimentation is anticipated a deep settling basin could be constructed which the water would enter prior to reaching the wetland the basin would require periodic maintenance to remove accumulated sediment constructed wetlands require maintenance especially in the first 510 years during which vegetation is growing and natural seeding is occurring providing suitable hydrologic conditions for vegetation growth and water treatment is key to successful performance of constructed wetlands constructed wetlands are generally applicable to most urban situations as long as there is adequate space for the facility an adequate source of water and appropriate soils in california such wetlands would likely be seasonal in nature the cost of urban lands often precludes this type of treatment in the more densely developed portions of urban areas a variation of this control is the use of existing wetlands for urban runoff treatment existing wetlands at or downstream of a new developmentredevelopment project can be enhanced to improve hydrology and runoff from the development project can be directed to the wetlands note that the dry detention pondsbasins retention pondswet basins and the constructed wetlands need to be periodically monitored for accumulation of toxic materials and provisions made for cleanout and disposal pretreatment may be added to remove heavy sediment trash and debris to reduce maintenance if a significant amount of sediment is anticipated a deep settling basin could be constructed this would also need to be periodically cleaned out to maintain capacity 9 filtration systems  filtration systems convey stormwater media eg sand compost charcoal to treat the storm water the chemicals treated vary depending on the type of media and may include fine sediment colloidal material hydrocarbons organics nutrients and dissolved metals such systems come in many sizes and designs including 1 inserts placed in individual storm drain inlets 2 linear units that treat stormwater from small impervious areas such as parking lots and 3 large 12 acre sand filters that treat runoff from urban catchments filters are effective as long as the capacity of the filter is not exceeded and the filter is not allowed to clog filter inserts are particularly problematic in this regard and recent testing and evaluation questions their applicability where material in runoff will clog or block the filter in stormwater applications filter systems are required to remove blocking materials leaves trash debris sediments oil and grease and storage to better manage flowrates experience to date with filter type inserts for drain inlets suggest that the units are easily clogged with sediment and debris with resultant bypassing of most of the flows therefore inserts are not recommended unless require frequent inspection and cleaning is performed filtration systems will have limited application in small wellmaintained parking lots 10 oilgrit separators  oilgrit gravity separators are usually multichambered treatment units that are placed underground and treat stormwater from a drainage catchment the individual chambers often are designed to trap grit and floatables and adsorb hydrocarbons flows in excess of the design capacity should be diverted around the unit otherwise there is the possibility that sediment previously trapped in the chambers will be resuspended and flushed downstream inspection and maintenance is required to ensure that the units are not filling up with sediment as accumulation can affect performance traditional gravity oilwater separators that utilize skimming devices and coalescing plates to increase droplet size and capture are generally not

that shall be employed to protect water quality additional best management practices measures and controls shall be employed as applicable and to the maximum extent practicable to prevent pollutants from entering storm water runoff bmps applicable to mobile car washers and car detailers the goal and purpose of these bmps is to minimize or prevent the discharge of pollutants into storm drains from vehicle and equipment cleaning operations by either 1 discharging wash waters to the sanitary sewer 2 containing wash water for offsite disposal or 3 directing wash water without cleaners to landscaped areas use these best management practices bmp1 planning determine what collection method you will be using and where you are going to discharge wash water before starting a new job identify where all storm drains are located in the vicinity of the jobsite never discharge wastewater into a street ditch storm drain or maintenance hole obtain all necessary permits and authorizations if you are going to discharge into the sanitary sewer system at the job site or on unpaved areas at the job site always obtain the property owners permission bmp2 preclean the work area before starting work sweep or vacuum the work area to pick up litter trash debris dirt and other materials which could become mixed in with the wash water use absorbents such as rags absorbent mats or pads rice hull ash cat litter vermiculite or sand to pick up greasy or oily materials and spills waste materials from precleaning may often be disposed of in the trash check with the local solid waste authority to be sure rags may be sent to an industrial laundry know which precleaning wastes may be hazardous wastes if there is any question as to whether a wash water or waste material is considered to be a hazardous material check with the monterey county division of environmental health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials bmp3 washing and detailing minimize the amount of water used during washing and detailing to reduce the amount of wash water that will need to be disposed avoid cleaning products that contain hazardous substances eg hydrofluoric acid muriatic acid sodium hydroxide bleach etc that can create hazardous waste when possible avoid using soap and solvents  even biodegradable soap is harmful to the environment if soap is used use phosphatefree nontoxic biodegradable soap any soap including those labeled biodegradable does not belong in creeks ocean or groundwater they are harmful to aquatic life and should never be misconstrued as safe for direct disposal to surface waters ie storm drains bmp4 wash water containment and collection contain and collect the wash water and dispose of it as described below decide what is the best method of collection eg berms storm drain cover mats containment pools vacuumspumps vacuum boom inflatable pipe plug etc locate property high and low spots to determine where wash water can be pooled for collection wash water that contains visible debris or residue soap detergent or other cleaning agents hazardous waste or excessive amounts of any pollutant may not be left on paved surfaces to evaporate because the residues will eventually be discharged to the storm drain system however small amounts of wash water that cannot reasonably be collected may be allowed to evaporate on a paved surface wash water from the rinsing of new or used vehicles for dust removal only using no soap may be discharged to the storm drain or and unpaved area if the wash water does not flow deposits or other surface contaminants promptly clean up any spill of liquid or solid wastes do not hose down an area to clean up a spill unless the liquid will be completely contained cleaned up and disposed of to sanitary sewer or offsite as appropriate for the waste type if possible either 1 use a designated wash area that is paved and protected by permanent or movable berms dikes and mats contain the washwater and vacuum it up or otherwise collect it for disposal do not allow wash water to leave the property if the driveway is an avenue for runoff it must be bermed to contain the washwater or 2 conduct washing and detailing on a pervious unpaved area such as lawn dirt or gravel so that the wash water will be retained and percolate within these areas keep washing activities away from storm drains or water conveyances so that the wash water will infiltrate into the ground and not flow to the storm drains or creeks this option applies to sites where only one or two vehicles are cleaned every couple of weeks do not use this option just before or after a rainstorm if neither of these approaches is feasible collect and contain the wash water and prevent it from flowing into any storm drains by sealing or plugging them or by protecting them with a berm or other means for information about containing wash water see the devices that may be used to contain and collect wash water bmp5 wash water disposal do not discharge wash water to storm drain once wash water has been collected either 1 discharge it to the sanitary sewer or septic system via the sanitary sewer cleanout or sanitary sewer inlet at the point of generation job site 2 discharge it to landscaping or other suitable unpaved areas or 3 collect it in a container for later disposal at an appropriate offsite location such locations could include a liquid waste receiving facility at a municipal wastewater treatment plant such as mrwpcas regional treatment plant located north of the city of marina or the sanitary sewer at the pressure washers place of business using the sewer clean out use of disposal options 1 and 2 require the property owners permission discharges must be in compliance with the wastewater authoritys sewer use or other applicable regulations of the authority for the monterey regional water pollution control agency mrwpca the applicable ordinances are mrwpcas sewer use which can be accessed at  for the carmel area wastewater district cawd the applicable cawds when cleaning surfaces such as buildings and decks without loose paint sidewalks or plazas without soap thorough dry cleanup should normally be sufficient to allow the wash water to be discharged to the sanitary sewer without pretreatment however if any debris is present in the wash water it should first pass mesh or finer screen to remove the material before discharging it to the sanitary sewer the material that is removed should be disposed of in the trash discharges of wash water to a septic system must be approved by the monterey county division of environmental health discharges that contain hazardous waste have the potential to harm septic systems or are likely to contaminate groundwater will not be approved with the property owners permission wash water can sometimes be disposed of to landscaping or other unpaved areas if this means of disposal is being considered first check the slope of the intended disposal area to be sure there will be no runoff into a street gutter or waterway also ensure that the wash water will not create a nuisance condition or contain food products or contaminants ie solvents cleaners oils metals etc that may constitute a hazardous waste if disposal to landscaped areas is being considered avoid damage to plants and soil by minimizing or eliminating the use of soaps detergents and chemicals in addition minimize the use of water to avoid wash water overflowing from these areas repeated discharges to landscaped areas may result in an accumulation of contaminants thus damaging vegetation and increasing contaminant levels in the soil if the soil is very dry wet it down thoroughly before discharging so that wash water will soak into the soil instead of running off to the street gutter or storm drain wash water disposal to land must not create a nuisance condition wash water containing garbage food wastes or visible trash may not be discharged to land be sure to read cleaning product labels before disposing of wash water follow use and disposal instructions carefully if there is any question as to whether a wash water or waste material is considered to be a hazardous material check with the monterey county division of environmental health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials depending on the condition of the surface being cleaned the wastewater generated could be classified as hazardous waste some examples include 1 wastewater generated from parking lots storage areas and gas stations may contain oil gas solvents antifreeze metals andor pesticides 2 washing building exteriors with paint made prior to 1978 may contain lead generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase operating costs and limit disposal options contact the monterey county division of environmental health for more information on hazardous waste determination and disposal bmps applicable to the washing andor cleaning of exterior surfaces eg sidewalks parking lots building exteriors etc the goal and purpose of these bmps is to minimize or prevent the discharge of pollutants into storm drains from washing andor cleaning operations by either 1 discharging wash waters to the sanitary sewer 2 containing wash water for offsite disposal to a suitable discharge facility or 3 directing wash water to landscaped or other unpaved areas these bmps apply to cleaning andor power washing of surfaces including but not limited to sidewalks and plazas  parking areas  driveways drivethrus  restaurantfood handling cleaning and storage areas  building exteriors roofs and decks  painted surfaces being cleaned to remove paint or graffiti  and graffiti removal use these best management practices bmp1 planning determine what collection method you will be using and where you are going to discharge wastewater before starting a new job identify where all storm drains are located in the vicinity of the jobsite never discharge wastewater into a street ditch storm drain or maintenance hole obtain all necessary permits and authorizations if you are going to discharge into the sanitary sewer system at the job site or on unpaved areas at the job site always obtain the property owners permission bmp2 surface precleaning before washing use dry methods for surface precleaning whenever possible in many cases the amount of wash water that will need to be collected and disposed of can be reduced if this process is followed 1 use absorbents such as rags absorbent mats or pads rice hull ash cat litter vermiculite or sand to pick up greasy or oily materials and spills 2 sweep or vacuum to pick up litter trash debris dirt and used absorbents 3 waste materials from dry cleanup such as absorbents paint chips etc may often be disposed of in the trash check with the local solid waste authority to be sure rags may be sent to an industrial laundry know which precleaning wastes may be hazardous waste bmp3 washing and cleaning minimize the amount of water used during washing and cleaning to reduce the amount of wash water that will need to be disposed avoid cleaning products that contain hazardous substances eg hydrofluoric acid muriatic acid sodium hydroxide bleach etc that can create hazardous waste avoid acidic caustic and other products that may damage paved or coated surfaces when possible avoid using soap  even biodegradable soap is harmful to the environment before using soap test to see whether hot water under pressure will do the job avoid using solventbased cleaners especially chlorinated solvent cleaners beware of pressure washing surfaces that contain leadbased paint or areas with freestanding liquids eg oil solvents antifreeze etc pressure washing these types of surfaces may generate hazardous waste eg leadbased paint chips oilgrease hydrofluoric acid muriatic acid etc generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase your operating costs and limit your disposal

etc locate property high and low spots to determine where wash water can be pooled for collection a simple and acceptable method for collecting wash water on private property requires only a drain plug small sump pump and a length of hose if a small parkinglottype catch basin is available remove the grate plug the drain pipe usually 2 3 or 4 inches in diameter and place the pump in the catch basin attached to a garden hose which will discharge to disposal see section below regarding disposal vacuum booms are another option for capturing and collecting wash water sand bags can be used to create a barrier around storm drains and plugs or rubber mats can be used to seal storm drain openings other common equipment used for containing and collecting wash water generated during pressure washing activities include vacuum pumps boomsberms portable containment areas weighted storm drain covers oilwater separators holding tanks portable sump pumps absorbents and more these are described in more detail below avoid mixing nonhazardous wash water with wash water known to contain hazardous levels of pollutants this will increase the volume of waste that requires treatment andor disposal as a hazardous waste thus increasing disposal costs do not leave areas of wash water on paved surfaces for evaporation sweep up any visible solids and sediments remaining after all the wash water has been collected surface cleaning wastewater that contains visible debris or residue soap detergent or other cleaning agents hazardous waste or excessive amounts of any pollutant may not be left on paved surfaces to evaporate because the residues will eventually be discharged to the storm drain system for additional information about containing wash water see the devices that may be used to contain and collect wash water bmp5 wash water disposal do not discharge wash water to storm drain once wash water has been collected either 1 discharge it to the sanitary sewer or septic system via the sanitary sewer cleanout or sanitary sewer inlet at the point of generation job site 2 discharge it to landscaping or other suitable unpaved areas or 3 collect it in a container for later disposal at an appropriate offsite location such locations could include a liquid waste receiving facility at a municipal wastewater treatment plant such as mrwpcas regional treatment plant located north of the city of marina or the sanitary sewer at the pressure washers place of business using the sewer clean out use of disposal options 1 and 2 require the property owners permission discharges to the sanitary sewer must comply with the discharge requirements of the appropriate wastewater authority the requirements of the two principal wastewater authorities within the area covered by the monterey regional storm water management program mrswmp are described in the requirements for discharge to the sanitary sewer when cleaning surfaces such as buildings and decks without loose paint sidewalks or plazas without soap thorough dry cleanup should normally be sufficient to allow the wash water to be discharged to the sanitary sewer without pretreatment however if any debris is present in the wash water it should first pass mesh or finer screen to remove the material before discharging it to the sanitary sewer the material that is removed should be disposed of in the trash discharges of surface cleaning wastewater to a septic system must be approved by the monterey county division of environmental health discharges that contain hazardous waste have the potential to harm septic systems or are likely to contaminate groundwater will not be approved with the property owners permission wash water can sometimes be disposed of to landscaping or other unpaved areas if this means of disposal is being considered first check the slope of the intended disposal area to be sure there will be no runoff into a street gutter or waterway also ensure that the wash water will not create a nuisance condition or contain food products or contaminants ie solvents cleaners oils metals etc that may constitute a hazardous waste if disposal to landscaped areas is being considered avoid damage to plants and soil by minimizing or eliminating the use of soaps detergents and chemicals in addition minimize the use of water to avoid wash water overflowing from these areas repeated discharges to landscaped areas may result in an accumulation of contaminants thus damaging vegetation and increasing contaminant levels in the soil if the soil is very dry wet it down thoroughly before discharging so that wash water will soak into the soil instead of running off to the street gutter or storm drain wash water disposal to land must not create a nuisance condition wash water containing garbage food wastes or visible trash may not be discharged to land be sure to read cleaning product labels before disposing of wash water follow use and disposal instructions carefully if there is any question as to whether a wash water or waste material is considered to be a hazardous material check with the monterey county division of environmental health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials depending on the condition of the surface being cleaned the wastewater generated could be classified as hazardous waste some examples include 3 wastewater generated from parking lots storage areas and gas stations may contain oil gas solvents antifreeze metals andor pesticides 4 washing building exteriors with paint made prior to 1978 may contain lead generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase operating costs and limit disposal options contact the monterey county division of environmental health for more information on hazardous waste determination and disposal devices that may be used to contain and collect wash water the following are examples of devices that may be used to contain and collect wash water the collection devices described are not endorsed and are only provided as a reference tool in addition there may be other containment devices available which are not listed note when working with electrical equipment in wet environments it is important to understand and comply with applicable healthsafety and electrical codes and well as utilize appropriate safety equipment eg ground fault interrupters etc for information about where equipment and materials of these types can be obtained see the sources of equipment and supplies berms berms may be used to prevent wastewater from entering a storm drain by placing a protective barrier around the storm drain inlet thus allowing wastewater to pool around the inlet prior to proper collection and disposal this type of containment may be less effective or ineffective when the storm drain is located at the bottom of a slope andor a large amount of wastewater is generated storm drain coversmats these devices are placed on top of the storm drain cover grate creating a quick seal thus preventing wastewater from entering the storm drain system storm drain coversmats magnetic vinyl mats pvc drain covers polyurethane mats and others allow wastewater to accumulate on top of it until the pressure washing activity is complete and the wash water can be collected for proper disposal storm drain coversmats are frequently used along with a vacuum device that diverts wastewater into the sanitary sewer containment pools a portable or temporary containment pool is another option which may be used to collect wash water containment pools are easy to assemble provide an immediate work area and allow wash water to be collected in a manner that will prevent pollutants from entering the storm drain system containment pools vary in size and material and can also be used for washing equipment and vehicles vacuumspumps devices such as wetdry vacuums sump pumps and vacuum pumps may be used to collect and dispose of wash water after pressure washing vacuum devices typically have an extension vacuum boom which allows the water to be collected efficiently in addition many vacuum devices are equipped with a hose that can run from the pump to the sanitary sewer a treatment device or a holding tank depending on the disposal method vacuum boom vacuum booms are an attachment for the vacuum device the boom typically rests flush on the ground and draws wastewater holes on the bottom of the boom in addition different varieties of vacuum booms are available for areas with steep slopes or rough terrain inflatable pipe plug inflatable pipe plugs prevent wash water from entering a storm drain system by blocking the pipe leading from the drain inlet unlike the storm drain matscovers that block the storm drain grates the inflatable pipe plug is inserted into the storm drain pipe and uses the inlet structure beneath the grate to collect the wash water once inserted the plug is inflated to make a snug fit once the wash water has been contained it can be collected and disposed by using a portable pump device note inflatable pipe plugs should only be used in storm drains on private property they are not authorized to be used in public storm drain inlets or pipes construction

storm water quality handbooks  project planning and design guide postconstruction bmps for new development and redevelopment the focus of this guidance is postconstruction bmps for new development or redevelopment projects postconstruction bmps are grouped into three types 1 site planning measures that avoid or reduce disturbance of the site and limit the addition of impervious surfaces  2 pollution prevention and source control measures that reduce or eliminate potential future sources of pollutants  and 3 treatment control measures that treat polluted runoff from new developmentredevelopment sites this guidance is focused strictly on specific controls that can be incorporated into individual development projects to avoid or reduce the pollutants from the particular project where appropriate pros and cons are described along with typical conditions under which these controls have been found to be effective the best opportunities for postconstruction controls are available in larger projects or when implemented on a regional basis and most of this guidance emphasizes controls that can be introduced in larger new developmentredevelopment projects discretionary approval process the second section of this guidance presents a list of controls that can be employed for small infilltype projects which are subject only to the ministerial approval process where the opportunities are limited projects requiring discretionary approval from the local jurisdiction include almost all projects except minor infill development this discretionary approval process is commonly the design review process although other discretionary approvals such as a use permit or a subdivision map approval may also be triggered depending on the characteristics of the project projects requiring ministerial approval are small improvement projects that conform to the site zoning requirements and include either a new singlefamily unit or minor modifications to an existing single family unit or a single structure such projects typically do not need discretionary approval but will in all cases need a ministerial permit such as a building or a grading permit postconstruction bmps for projects requiring discretionary approvals site planning bmps this group of postconstruction controls includes site planning to protect sensitive resources at or near the site and the use of alternate paving and cover materials to reduce the amount of impervious surfaces added by a new development studies have shown that in singlefamily residential areas streets are the primary producers of runoff and sidewalks and lawns if properly vegetated are a minor source in multifamily developments streets parking lots and roofs generate similar quantities of runoff in commercialindustrial areas parking lots and roofs are the main generators of runoff it follows then that to reduce impervious surfaces in singlefamily residential areas reduction of street width and driveway lengths should be the primary strategy while in multifamily developments and industrialcommercial areas strategies should focus on reducing parking lots and the footprint of buildings for more information on site planning refer to start at the source residential site planning and design guidance manual for stormwater quality protection available from basmaa site planning bmps that minimize impervious surface and maximize infiltration are described below 1 cluster development  concentrate the development on a limited portion of the site and leave the remaining portion undisturbed this should be used where appropriate without creating other hazards such as those of access during emergencies 2 preserve natural drainages  this measure includes not filling in the natural drainage features at the site maintaining invertstreambeds to maximize capacity and providing vegetated setbacks or buffer strips outside of the maximum water surface level main concerns are related to safety especially of children and future need for mosquitopest control 3 reduce sidewalk widths especially in lowtraffic areas  this control provides limited runoff reduction benefits and reduction of width may not possible due to americans with disabilities act ada requirements 1 avoid curb and gutter along driveways and streets where appropriate  this is recommended in areas where flooding and ponding of water creating mosquito habitat is not a problem replace with swales 2 use alternate paving materialsporouspermeable materials where appropriate  this measure includes use of alternate paving materials eg porous asphalt pervious concrete pavers landscaping mulch gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement pavers are recommended for driveways walkways and patios in singlefamily residences where the site does not generate highly polluted runoff that could contaminate groundwater if it were to infiltrate and where ada requirements do not have to be met in nonresidential areas pavers are recommended for emergency access roads overflow parking areas and nonhandicapped parking stalls note some types of alternate paving materials may not be suitable where heavy loads eg truck movement are anticipated for more information on alternate paving materials see postconstruction controls for new development fact sheets available from basmaa 3 reduce the length of driveways or infiltrate driveway runoff  this control applies mainly to singlefamily residential units if reduction of the driveway length is not possible grade and construct driveway so that runoff from driveway is directed to the adjacent landscaped areas 4 reduce street width by eliminating onstreet parking where such actions do not pose a safety hazard  this measure can be generally used in new residential areas in addition to reducing the impervious area this control has the added benefit of removing cars from streets and making street sweeping easier and more effective if onstreet parking in residential areas is eliminated the developer must provide adequate offstreet visitor parking 5 reduce alley width or use alternate materials for paving alleys  if alleys are included in a proposed development width should be minimized or alternate paving materials should be used 6 set aside open space  this control is recommended for all developments residential and nonresidential the main concern with open space relates to maintenance weed control and fire prevention this group includes controls that can be incorporated into new developmentredevelopment projects to avoid pollution in the long run by eliminating sources pollution prevention and source control bmps this group of bmps includes controls that can be incorporated into new developmentredevelopment projects to avoid pollution by eliminating sources 1 provide green areas where pets can be exercised  pet excrement is a major source of bacteria in urban runoff provide green areas in new residential developments where people can walk their pets and keep pet excrement away from sidewalks and streets 2 install landscaping or other cover  clearing and grading of surfaces in new development can increase potential for erosion install landscaping or other cover materials to minimize erosion from graded surfaces use of native plant materials is recommended because native plants require less maintenance and irrigation and are typically more resistant to fires than nonnative grasses native plants do take longer to cover slopes therefore during the first few years supplemental protection erosion blanket mulch etc will be necessary 3 incorporate lowmaintenance landscaping  at sites where erosion may not be a concern but landscaping is proposed as part of the development use lowmaintenance landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer pesticide and herbicide application assistance in identifying the types of trees shrubs and ground cover that would work in the community based on local climatic and soil conditions can be obtained from garden centers landscapers and other sources 4 label storm drains to discourage dumping  label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language such as no dumping  drains to ocean andor graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping signs and prohibitive language andor graphical icons which prohibit illegal dumping must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained 5 where possible eliminate guttersroof drains or direct runoff to landscaped areas  roof drains can be eliminated only in one to twostory buildings where these cannot be eliminated direct the downspout of the gutter to a landscaped area or into an infiltration trench install several gutters to distribute the flow 6 construct designated vehicle wash area  in new residential developments involving more than 50 units construct a designated vehicle wash area so that the runoff from vehicle washing can be property treated andor disposed contact the local wastewater authority to determine if the discharge can be plumbed to the sanitary sewer if not provide appropriate treatment and disposal of this runoff 7 where possible use underground parking and the construction of multistoried parking structures  for commercial projects build underground or multistory parking structures so that not only is impervious surface minimized but the parking surfaces are under a roof and not exposed to storm water 8 where possible use cooperative or shared parking  for commercial areas this may be a cooperative effort between commercial entities or between commercial entities and the city 9 use alternate paving materials for parking lots  this control is recommended for overflow parking areas and for less frequently used parking spaces typically these are spaces along the periphery of the parking lot that will not have to meet ada requirements and due to low usage there will be less concern regarding pollution of groundwater of stall runoff 10 use measures to reduce building footprint and increase use of taller structures where appropriate  this control is recommended for commercial and municipal structures where it would also be consistent with other city planning and building requirements 11 berm waste storage areas  grade and pave outdoor waste receptacle areas to prevent runon of storm water and install a low containment berm around it alternately construct a covered enclosure with washdown capabilities plumbed into the sanitary sewer after first contacting the local wastewater authority to verify that this practice will be acceptable 12 install valves on storm drain inlets in loading dock areas  at commercialindustrial facilities where loading docks are proposed install a valves to control runoff in the event of spills treatment bmps this group of bmps includes controls that can be built at new development and redevelopment sites to capture and treat the polluted runoff before it enters the citys storm drain system or other receiving waters those bmps which are feasible for the proposed development should be incorporated into its design treatment control design standards depending on the type of units are based on either treating a given volume of runoff eg first 05 inch of runoff or a peak flow rate associated with a design storm the volume approach is often utilized for small catchments where there tends to be a first flush condition eg a parking lot design storms for storm water controls may be small eg recurrence intervals of 3 months to 2 years compared to flood control designs standards because of the need to minimize the size and cost of the unit and because most runoff is associated with the more frequent smaller events treatment controls must be designed such that volumes and flows in excess of the design standard bypass the unit otherwise there is the possibility of aggravating flooding and also causing resuspension of previously captured sediments or other constituents also all of the treatment bmps described below require some inspection maintenance and disposal of solids to ensure optimum performance and often to avoid flooding 1 rooftop catchment systems  these are rooftops which can sometimes be designed into large commercial and industrial sites to pool stormwater which following the storm evaporates this effectively eliminates rooftop runoff from the storm drain system and thereby reduces the hydraulicallyconnected impervious area another function of these systems is to slow down the runoff to reduce peaks problems with rooftop catchment systems are mainly related to leakage 2 vegetated filter strips  vegetated filter strips buffer strips or riparian buffer zones are strips of vegetation placed between receiving waters eg along streams and pollutant sources the effectiveness of the strips depend primarily on the width of the strip and the vegetation type and condition strips of 100300 feet in width are often considered such strips have been successfully applied to urban agricultural and forestry situations vegetation type selection must take into account the climate and usually should be droughtresistant maintenance is primarily annual cutting such strips are recommended for developments located along receiving waters such as streams rivers and lakes but outside the flood control boundary 3 vegetated swales  swales are shallow low gradient channels that are vegetated they are commonly applied in rural residential areas in lieu of traditional curbgutters and underground stormwater drainage pipes water quality improvement is achieved primarily performance is dependent on the swale hydraulic capacity and vegetation type and condition influent water should be relatively free of coarse sediment to avoid burying the vegetation where sediment loads are of concern sediment settling basins can be provided upstream of the swales maintenance consists primarily of vegetation management and settling basin cleanouts swales are generally recommended for lowdensity residential developments located in relatively flat terrain 4 infiltration basins  infiltration basins store and infiltrate stormwater into the surficial groundwater aquifer performance is critically dependent on soil porosity and adequate depth to groundwater such conditions are typical of inland valleys in contrast to low lying coastal areas in order to maintain recharge rates influent water may require pretreatment to remove sediments infiltration basins are effective at reducing runoff rates and volumes and can provide water supply benefits recharge maintenance primarily consists of periodic removal of accumulated trash debris and sediments to maintain recharge rates infiltration basins are generally recommended in areas where the depth to groundwater is relatively high and the soils are highly pervious where such conditions exist this technology is generally applicable to the entire range of urban development although the potential for groundwater contamination is often of concern in industrial areas 5 infiltration trenches  infiltration trenches are shallow drains filled with high porosity materials eg gravel stormwater discharged to these trenches is stored during the runoff event and infiltrates into the groundwater during dry weather periods as with infiltration basins performance requires porous subsoils and adequate depth to the groundwater table the acceptability and designs of infiltration trenches must take into consideration the potential for infiltrating water to adversely affect soil strength around foundations infiltration trenches are generally not recommended for roof runoff near buildings because of building code requirements  but can be effective as part of the overall open channel drainage system 6 dry detention pondsbasins  these are basins designed to temporarily store and treat storm water prior to gradually releasing it downstream such basins can provide flood control and storm water treatment benefits treatment performance depends on storage volume 1224 hours of residence time is considered a good rule of thumb and good circulation avoidance of short circuiting a major factor limiting good performance is that during larger storm runoff events water entering a dry basin may resuspend previously settled material in which case the ponds may act as a source of sediment and associated chemicals in general dry basins are not as effective as wet basins discussed below however in certain arid areas wet basins are not feasible performance of dry basins can be improved by incorporating slow release outlet structures such basins are generally applicable to residential commercial and industrial development in areas where there is insufficient runoff to maintain wet basins 7 retention pondswet basins  these are basins that contain a permanent pool of water such ponds can provide flood control ecological and water quality benefits the performance of wet basins depends on the size of the basin watershed characteristics and influent conditions the primary treatment process in retention ponds is settling maintenance is required for removing debris vegetation management and maintaining the inlet and outlet structures accumulation rates in such basins typically require that accumulated sediment be removed about once every 1020 years retention ponds are generally applicable to most urban situations as long as there is adequate space for the facility and acceptable geological conditions 8 constructedrestored wetlands  in addition to providing flood control and water supply benefits recharge of groundwater constructed wetlands designed for stormwater management provide water quality benefits number of processes including sedimentation filtration absorption biological processes and nutrient uptake pollutant removal performance depends on the size of the wetland relative to the watershed the design of the wetland and the type and composition of wetland vegetation wetlands also provide additional ecological and recreational benefits if a significant amount of sedimentation is anticipated a deep settling basin could be constructed which the water would enter prior to reaching the wetland the basin would require periodic maintenance to remove accumulated sediment constructed wetlands require maintenance especially in the first 510 years during which vegetation is growing and natural seeding is occurring providing suitable hydrologic conditions for vegetation growth and water treatment is key to successful performance of constructed wetlands constructed wetlands are generally applicable to most urban situations as long as there is adequate space for the facility an adequate source of water and appropriate soils in california such wetlands would likely be seasonal in nature the cost of urban lands often preclude this type of treatment in the more densely developed portions of urban areas a variation of this control is the use of existing wetlands for urban runoff treatment existing wetlands at or downstream of a new developmentredevelopment project can be enhanced to improve hydrology and runoff from the development project can be directed to the wetlands note that the dry detention pondsbasins retention pondswet basins and the constructed wetlands need to be periodically monitored for accumulation of toxic materials and provisions made for cleanout and disposal pretreatment may be added to remove heavy sediment trash and debris to reduce maintenance if a significant amount of sediment is anticipated a deep settling basin could be constructed this would also need to be periodically cleaned out to maintain capacity 9 filtration systems  filtration systems convey stormwater media eg sand compost charcoal to treat the storm water the chemicals treated vary depending on the type of media and may include fine sediment colloidal material hydrocarbons organics nutrients and dissolved metals such systems come in many sizes and designs including 1 inserts placed in individual storm drain inlets 2 linear units that treat stormwater from small impervious areas such as parking lots and 3 large 12 acre sand filters that treat runoff from urban catchments filters are effective as long as the capacity of the filter is not exceeded and the filter is not allowed to clog filter inserts are particularly problematic in this regard and recent testing and evaluation questions their applicability where material in runoff will clog or block the filter in stormwater applications filter systems are required to remove blocking materials leaves trash debris sediments oil and grease and storage to better manage flow rates experience to date with filter type inserts for drain inlets suggest that the units are easily clogged with sediment and debris with resultant bypassing of most of the flows therefore inserts are not recommended unless frequent inspection and cleaning is performed filtration systems will have limited application in small wellmaintained parking lots 10 oilgrit separators  oilgrit gravity separators are usually multichambered treatment units that are placed underground and treat stormwater from a drainage catchment the individual chambers often are designed to trap grit and floatables and adsorb hydrocarbons flows in excess of the design capacity should be diverted around the unit otherwise there is the possibility that sediment previously trapped in the chambers will be resuspended and flushed downstream inspection and maintenance is required to ensure that the units are not filling up with sediment as accumulation can affect performance traditional gravity oilwater separators that utilize skimming devices and coalescing plates to increase droplet size and capture are generally not applicable to stormwater conditions where total hydrocarbon concentrations are generally less than 10 mgl the performance of oilgrit separators varies depending on the chosen design research should be done before selecting any separators to verify that they will perform as desired in general oilgrit separators are useful only at sites where there are chances that oil spills could occur and to a limited degree at development sites that have high oil and grease loadings such as petroleum storage yards and vehicle storage facilities postconstruction bmps for projects requiring ministerial approvals 1 incorporate lowmaintenance landscaping  use lowmaintenance droughttolerant landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer pesticide and herbicide application 2 label storm drains to discourage dumping  label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language such as no dumping  drains to ocean andor graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping signs and prohibitive language andor graphical icons which prohibit illegal dumping must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained 3 where possible direct gutters to landscaped areas  roof drains may be eliminated only in one to twostory buildings where these cannot be eliminated direct the downspout of the gutter to landscaped area or into an infiltration trench install several gutters to distribute the flow note that roof drains may be eliminated in residential and some commercial areas only and should not be eliminated in industrial areas 4 use alternate paving materialsporouspermeable materials where appropriate  use alternate paving materials pavers landscaping mulch gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement pavers are recommended for driveways walkways and patios in singlefamily residences where the site does not generate highly polluted runoff that could contaminate groundwater if it were to infiltrate and where ada requirements do not have to be met in nonresidential areas pavers are recommended for emergency access roads overflow parking areas and nonhandicapped parking stalls these are not recommended where heavy loads eg truck movement are anticipated for more information on alternate paving materials see postconstruction controls for new development fact sheets available from basmaa providing proof of ongoing

categories are subject to the design standards set forth below these categories are 1 singlefamily hillside residences 2 100000 square foot commercial developments 3 automotive repair shops 4 retail gasoline outlets 5 restaurants 6 home subdivisions with 10 or more housing units 7 parking lots 5000 square feet or more or with 25 or more parking spaces and potentially exposed to storm water runoff 1 design standards applicable to all categories a peak storm water runoff discharge rates postdevelopment peak storm water runoff discharge rates shall not exceed the estimated predevelopment rate for developments where the increased peak storm water discharge rate will result in increased potential for downstream erosion b conserve natural areas if determined appropriate by the city the following items must be implemented in the site layout during the subdivision design and approval process consistent with applicable general plan and local area plan policies 1 concentrate or cluster development on portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural undisturbed condition 2 limit clearing and grading of native vegetation at a site to the minimum amount needed to build lots allow access and provide fire protection 3 maximize trees and other vegetation at each site by planting additional vegetation clustering tree areas and promoting the use of native andor drought tolerant plants 4 promote natural vegetation by using parking lot islands and other landscaped areas 5 preserve riparian areas and wetlands c minimize storm water pollutants of concern the development must be designed so as to minimize to the maximum extent practicable the introduction of pollutants of concern that may result in significant impacts generated from site runoff of directly connected impervious areas dcia to the storm water conveyance system as approved by the building official pollutants of concern consist of any pollutants that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics current loadings or historic deposits of the pollutant are impacting the beneficial uses of a receiving water elevated levels of the pollutant are found in sediments of a receiving water andor have the potential to bioaccumulate in organisms therein or the detectable inputs of the pollutant are at concentrations or loads considered potentially toxic to humans andor flora and fauna in meeting this specific requirement minimization of the pollutants of concern will require the incorporation of a bmp or combination of bmps best suited to maximize the reduction of pollutant loadings in that runoff to the maximum extent practicable d protect slopes and channels project plans must include bmps consistent with local codes ordinances or other regulatory mechanism and these design standards to decrease the potential of slopes andor channels from eroding and impacting storm water runoff 1 convey runoff safely from the tops of slopes and stabilize disturbed slopes 2 utilize natural drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable 3 stabilize permanent channel crossings 4 vegetate slopes with native or drought tolerant vegetation as appropriate 5 install energy dissipaters such as riprap at the outlets of new storm drains culverts conduits or channels that enter unlined channels in accordance with applicable specifications to minimize erosion with the approval of all agencies with jurisdiction eg the us army corps of engineers and the california department of fish and game e provide storm drain system stenciling and signage all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area must be stenciled with prohibitive language such as no dumping  drains to ocean andor graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping signs and prohibitive language andor graphical icons which prohibit illegal dumping must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained f properly design outdoor material storage areas outdoor material storage areas refer to storage areas or storage facilities solely for the storage of materials where proposed project plans include outdoor areas for storage of materials that may contribute pollutants to the storm water conveyance system the following structural or treatment bmps are required 1 materials with the potential to contaminate storm water must be a placed in an enclosure such as but not limited to a cabinet shed or similar structure that prevents contact with runoff or spillage to the storm water conveyance system  or b protected by secondary containment structures such as berms dikes or curbs 2 the storage area must be paved and sufficiently impervious to contain leaks and spills 3 the

cause the city may waive one or more of the requirements set forth in this impracticability for a specific property can be established a waiver of impracticability shall be granted only when all other structural or treatment control bmps have been considered and rejected as infeasible recognized situations of impracticability include i extreme limitations of space for treatment on a redevelopment project ii unfavorable or unstable soil conditions at a site to attempt infiltration and iii risk of ground water contamination because a known unconfined aquifer lies beneath the land surface or an existing or potential underground source of drinking water is less than 10 feet from the soil surface a waiver may be revoked for cause and with proper notice 4 limitation on use of infiltration bmps three factors significantly influence the potential for storm water to contaminate ground water they are i pollutant mobility ii pollutant abundance in storm water iii and soluble fraction of pollutant the risk of contamination of groundwater may be reduced by pretreatment of storm water in addition the distance of the groundwater table from the infiltration bmp may also be a factor determining the risk of contamination a water table distance separation of ten feet depth in california presumptively poses negligible risk for storm water not associated with industrial activity or high vehicular traffic site specific conditions must be evaluated when determining the most appropriate bmp additionally monitoring and maintenance must be provided to ensure groundwater is protected and the infiltration bmp is not rendered ineffective by overload this is especially important for infiltration bmps for areas of industrial activity or areas subject to high vehicular traffic 25000 or greater average daily traffic adt on main roadway or 15000 or more adt on any intersecting roadway in some cases pretreatment may be necessary 5 alternative certification for storm water treatment mitigation in lieu of conducting a detailed bmp plan review to verify structural or treatment control bmp adequacy the city may at its discretion elect to accept a signed certification from a civil engineer or a licensed architect registered in the state of california that the plan meets the criteria established herein certifying persons will have to demonstrate to the citys satisfaction that they have been trained on bmp design for water quality not more than two years prior to the signature date training conducted by an organization with storm water bmp design expertise eg a university

for review shall be considered when evaluating all lot line adjustment applications a only legal lots may be subdivided or the subject of a lot line adjustment no subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved which increases or creates a zoning nonconformity or is inconsistent with the policies of the certified local coastal land use plan all lots and sites created shall comply with minimum standards established for the zoning district which the property is located and with any other relevant requirements of the certified local coastal implementation plan b no subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved which increases or creates a zoning violation or any other kind of illegality c no lot line adjustment shall be approved that could lead to the creation of an additional building site unless a parcel map is prepared for example if the minimum lot size is 4000 square feet and there are two adjoining lots one of which is 7000 square feet and another of 5000 square feet no lot line adjustment shall be allowed which would result in one lot of 8000 square feet and one lot of 4000 square feet because the newly created lot of 8000 square feet could possibly be divided into two lots of 4000 square feet d until there is sufficient water allocated in the citys water management program to provide for development of all existing lots of record within the city no subdivision or lot line adjustment application shall be approved that would result in the creation an additional lot of record parcel or building site if such creation would increase the demand for water resources e approval of a subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be conditioned upon all zoning requirements being met on all lots involved in the subdivision or lot line adjustment the planning commission may expect preexisting zoning nonconformities from this requirement if compliance is determined not to be in the public interest or contrary to the general plan f if when curing a nonconformity or illegality that would be created by a lot line adjustment one side of a building must be moved because it is too close to the proposed new line another side of the building which is nonconforming shall not be required to be conformed unless the building is moved demolished or rebuilt g lot line adjustments increasing the average length of frontage on public streets for each lot involved in the lot line adjustment shall be encouraged h lot line adjustments tending to straighten lot lines shall be encouraged i lot line adjustments tending to cause lots to be more rectangular

resources  effects of allocation  purpose the city recognizes a need to conserve and manage its water resources to achieve adopted land use planning objectives the water resources of the city are presently derived from a water allocation system implemented by the monterey peninsula water management district it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a water management program that a reduces unnecessary water consumption in existing and new development  b provides a process for dedication of the citys limited water resources in new development  c establishes a process for determining the broad land use categories to be served of existing and future water resources available to the city  and d implements the general plan and coastal land use plan  2004   2004  water conservation water conservation is an integral part of the citys water management program water resources available to the city are limited in some cases water conservation can increase the effective supply and allow development that otherwise would not be possible water conservation in new development can reduce the demand from each project and thereby increase the number of projects that can be served with available resources it is the intent of this chapter to establish uniform standards for water conservation and to provide guidance on the manner in which conserved water is to be used within the citys total water management program a uniform standards for plumbing fixtures the use of waterconserving plumbing fixtures shall be required for all new construction all existing plumbing fixtures within any building that do not comply with the adopted standards for water conservation shall be replaced with complying fixtures upon issuance of any building permit authorizing substantial construction standards for waterconserving plumbing fixtures and the criteria for when such fixtures are required are established in cmc b landscaping standards it is recognized that the irrigation of plants used in landscaping can consume large quantities of water proper design of irrigation systems and proper selection of plant species can significantly reduce water consumption while achieving a more natural appearance in community design use of native plants and other species habituated to the central coast see landscaping standards contained in cmc landscaping  2004   2004  allocation of

resolution shall define 1 the remaining quantity of water available to the city including any new supplies made available since adoption of the last allocation resolution  2 a list of defined land use or project categories for which water will be made available  3 a discrete quantity of water expressed in acrefeet per year to be allotted for each defined land use category  and 4 a discrete quantity of water to be held as unallocated reserves b planning commission review and monitoring before adoption of an allocation resolution the city council shall consider recommendations on the appropriate distribution of water to implement the general plan and the local coastal program as determined by the planning commission each allocation resolution shall reserve at least 10 percent of available water resources for projects that will create new affordable housing units for moderately low low or very lowincome households each allocation resolution also shall ensure that water is reserved for anticipated projects serving coastal recreation access and essential public services the allocation resolution shall remain in effect until replaced by a subsequent resolution containing the same information and following the same process as outlined above the planning commission should review water allocations for consistency with the general plan and the local coastal program on an annual basis and forward any recommendations for change to the city council during the last month of each calendar year c unallocated reserves water held in unallocated reserves shall not be used for any project or land use change until transferred to a defined allocation category such transfers shall be made by adopting a new allocation resolution as described in subsection a of this section reserves are intended to provide a means of adjusting water allocations to respond to changing conditions and general plan policy if new water resources become available to the city by action of the monterey peninsula water management district they shall be placed in unallocated reserves administratively until distributed to other categories of a new allocation resolution  2004   2004  effects of

water resources each proposed change in land use or project for which an application is submitted shall be evaluated to determine whether its approval could result in a net increase in water use as defined by the water management district projects involving no net increase in water use or that will create new housing affordable to moderate low or very lowincome households may be accepted and processed without regard to water allocations for projects that may result in a net increase in water use the following procedure shall be used by the department 1 the project shall first be classified into one or more land use categories based on the type of project for example a mixeduse project would be classified into both the commercial and multifamily residential categories 2 an estimate shall then be made of the net increase in water use that would result from the project within each land use category 3 if the project would require water from a land use category for which no allocation has been made the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed 4 if the project would require more water from a land use category than currently remains after considering the original allocation minus all existing precommitments and dedications the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed or shall be denied an exception shall be allowed if the project would create housing affordable to moderate low or very lowincome households in such cases the project shall be processed and then put on a waiting list until water resources become available 5 if the project requires water and there is a sufficient supply remaining in the allocation for each category affected by the project to fully meet the anticipated demand

precommitment of water resources shall be temporarily assigned to the project during processing of the application the department shall keep a record of the remaining balance of water within each allocation category and a running total of all temporary precommitments and dedications to ensure that applications are not accepted for processing for which water would be unavailable upon approval for projects that are denied or abandoned the precommitment shall be terminated and the water shall be administratively restored to its original allocation category b approval of applications once an application for a project requiring water resources has been approved the department shall permanently reduce the remaining balance within each allocation category affected by the project and shall issue a water release to the monterey peninsula water management district authorizing a debit to the citys water allocation this action shall terminate the temporary precommitment of water resources and create a permanent dedication of water resources to the project subject to all applicable time limits established in the permit or by the municipal code c abandonment of dedicated water resources upon making a determination that a water release has expired without use or that time limits applicable to a project have expired without implementation all water previously dedicated to a project but not used shall be considered abandoned all water abandoned or not used by such unimplemented projects shall be returned to the allocation category from which it originated and shall become available
