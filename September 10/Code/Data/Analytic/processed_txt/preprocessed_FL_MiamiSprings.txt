employee disciplinary action a intent 1 it is the intent of the civil service system that effective supervision and employee relations will avoid most matters which necessitate disciplinary action the purpose of the rules and disciplinary action for violation of the rules is not intended to restrict the rights of anyone but to insure the rights of all and to secure cooperation and orderliness throughout the civil service system 2 in recognition of the fact that each instance differs in many respects from somewhat similar situations the city retains the right to treat each occurrence on an individual basis without creating a precedent for other cases which may arise in the future the city retains the right to suspend any disciplinary action which it may take during good behavior for a specified term at its exclusive discretion 3 examples given in any rule do not limit the generality of the rule the rules and regulations are not to be construed as a limitation on the retained rights of the city but merely as a guide to provide recommended standard penalties for specific offenses this is intended to mean that a more severe penalty may be issued than that which appears in the standard procedure if it is felt necessary 4 the types of offenses requiring disciplinary action are divided into three types to reflect degrees of severity of offenses 5 in each group and for each rule consideration will be given to the severity of the offense the cost involved the time interval between violations the length and quality of service records and the ability of the employee concerned in each case where the penalty is modified from the recommended standard the reasons for such modification will be noted in writing 6 in addition to the general types of offenses listed infraction of departmental rules and regulations will subject the employee to disciplinary action b authority and procedure 1 removals suspensions and demotions for cause are effected by department heads or by the city manager 2 whenever the department head determines that there are reasons for dismissal suspension or demotion of a regular employee under his supervision in the civil service the

reduction or dismissal the legal department and personnel director shall be notified not more than 48 hours after such relief from duty 4 within 30 days after the notification required above written notice of suspension reduction or dismissal stating the reasons therefore and the date from which such action is effective shall be given to such employee or mailed to his usual place of residence a copy of such notice shall be submitted to the personnel director 5 in the event that good and sufficient reasons exist making it impractical or impossible to give or mail such written notice to the employee within the 30day period the personnel director showing good cause may extend the period for giving notice for an additional period not to exceed 30 days 6 any permanent fulltime employee may appeal such disciplinary action within ten working days after delivery or mailing of the written notice by filing a written request for a hearing to the civil service board in the office of the personnel director c written reprimand 1 whenever employee performance attitude work habits or personal conduct at any time fall below a desirable level supervisors shall inform employees promptly and specifically of such lapses and give counsel and assistance if appropriate and justified a reasonable period of time for improvements may be allowed before initiating disciplinary measures 2 in situations where an oral warning has not resulted in the expected improvement a written reprimand shall be issued defining the nature of the infraction under the rules the written reprimand will be sent to the employee and a copy shall be placed in the employees personnel folder the employees immediate supervisor usually initiates a written reprimand d suspensions 1 a department head may for disciplinary purposes suspend an employee without pay for a length of time appropriate to the offense not to exceed 20 working days in any 12month period 2 on request of the employee the department head has the option of making an equivalent deduction from the employees accumulated compensatory leave or annual leave in lieu of suspension without pay the department head may apply this equivalent deduction to all or part of the employees suspension time 3 in cases where an employee is charged with a crime and the department head determines that the charge has some bearing on the employees performance of his job if found guilty the department head shall make a review of the matter and may suspend the employee without pay until the final determination of the court if the employee is subsequently acquitted of the crime the employee will be reinstated with full back pay and benefits e types of offenses the three groups of offenses and guides for standard recommended penalties are

dancers erotic message may be slightly less effective from four feet away the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired 22 separating dancers from patrons and

authority and findings a purpose in the development and enforcement of this subsection 150165d adult related business regulations the city recognizes that adultrelated businesses because of their very nature have serious objectionable characteristics and have a deleterious effect upon adjacent business and residential areas it is desirable therefore to protect the wellbeing of the youth of the city

religious facilities parks instructional schools serving minors and day care centers the city finds that just as advertising is designed to stimulate ones appetite for desired goods and services an overabundance or preoccupation with sexual displays or materials arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied and encourages criminal sexual behavior in recognition of the protections afforded to the citizens of the united states under the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the united states it is neither the intent nor the effect of this subsection to i inhibit freedom of speech or the press  or ii limit or restrict the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials  or iii restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment  or iv deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market  or v regulate obscenity which is regulated by general law florida statutes this subsection balances the legitimate governmental purposes of the city against the abovedescribed constitutional rights by imposing incidental contentneutral place time and manner regulations of adultrelated businesses without limiting alternative avenues of communication the regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable effects arising from these businesses are set forth in this subsection licensing and operational regulations for these uses are in of this b authority this subsection is enacted pursuant to the citys home rule power to enact

significancearchitecture history and context respectivelyie a site with a rating of 123 would have a 1 in architecture a 2 in history and a 3 in context a rating of 1 implies major significance a rating of 2 means the site has secondary significance but its preservation should still be considered and a rating of 3 indicates minor significance approved 32684 archeological significance a for properties of archeological significance the following criteria is used to determine the significance of an archeological site 1 important historical event or person associated with the site 2 the quality of the site or the date recoverable from the site is of sufficient enough significance that it would provide unique information on prehistoric or historical events 3 the site was the locus of discreet types of activities such as habitation religious burial fortification etc 4 the site was the location of historic or prehistoric activities during a particular period of time 5 the site maintains a sufficient degree of environmental integrity to reflect some aspect of the relationship of the sites original occupants to the environment b archeological sites identified in the survey are also rated for their preservation quality 1 the site is intact and has had little or no subsurface disturbance the site should be preserved or excavated if threatened with destruction or alteration 2 the site is slightly to moderately disturbed but what actually remains has considerable potential for providing useful information the site should be preserved if possible and considered for excavation if threatened with destruction or alteration 3 the site is severely disturbed which may include destruction or disturbance to an area of the site the quality and volume of existing data may still permit useful and representative data to be recovered preservation of the site should be considered and excavation may be appropriate to mitigate any adverse impact on the site 4 the site is severely altered and the quality of the data is poor neither preservation or excavation is recommended 5 the site has been completely destroyed 6 the preservation quality of the site is unknown because the site is covered by a structure roadway or fill c archeological sites also receive a classification according to their site type prehistoric 1 constructed mounds 2 earthworks 3 trails 4

activity d all archeological sites are rated in a numerical sequence the first number refers to the preservation quality of the site following the first number is a dash which is followed by a second number which refers to the type of archeological site an example of an archeological rating is 221 which would mean that the site is a coontie mill from between 18191860 and is slightly disturbed but has the potential for providing useful information preservation of the site should be encouraged and an archeological excavation should be attempted if the site is threatened approved 32684

general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific area by the provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands b objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines street and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight  and 7 to insure that

florida water management district prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management agency 4 assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of that watercourse so that the floodcarrying capacity is not diminished 5 verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor including basement of all new or substantially improved buildings as required herein 6 verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level to which the new or substantially improved buildings have been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter 7 when floodproofing is utilized for a particular building the chief building official shall obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with the requirements of this chapter 8 where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the chief building official shall make the necessary interpretation the person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter 9 when base flood election data or

repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see  15402 upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure e in passing upon such applications the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors and all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent facility  6 the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges f upon consideration of the factors listed in division e1 11 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter g variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 1
