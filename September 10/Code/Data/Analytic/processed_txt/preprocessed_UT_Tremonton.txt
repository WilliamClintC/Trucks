interest and general welfare of the community to assist in the public and private improvements of the central business district cbd in order to influence the creation of a better economic social and physical environment to accommodate the expected growth in the service area the utah neighborhood development act uca 195 11191 authorizes local government officials to establish a redevelopment agency to undertake the process of redevelopment the agency is the vehicle for the replanning redesigning and rehabilitating of areas structures or uses which show evidence of deterioration and dilapidation or otherwise pose a threat to the public health and safety of the community on  the tremonton city council designated themselves by as the redevelopment agency of the city of tremonton complete with all powers and subject to all restrictions provided in the neighborhood development act the tremonton city council has designated by resolution the general area between 100 north and 100 south from the railroad tracks on the west to the malad river on the east as the survey area with the assistance of a redevelopment consultant a survey of the physical social and economic conditions was conducted to determine the need and feasibility for undertaking a redevelopment program the purpose of the survey was to assess the overall conditions within the area which indicate characteristics detrimental to good planning development and economic use 7211 project boundary description beginning at a point 79 feet south of the southwest corner of block 13 plat a tremonton city survey said point being on the south side of 100 south street and on the east edge of the malad valley railroad running thence east 591 feet to the east edge of 100 west street  thence north 244 feet  thence east 317 feet to the west edge of tremont street  thence south 244 feet to the south edge of 100 south street  thence east to the west bank of the malad river  thence northeasterly along the

alleys were not included in the tabulation but are included in the project area of the 3113 3135 acres of private land in the project some 512 acres 175% are vacant and 623 acres 213% are used for housing it is felt that 112 acres of housing and automobile garage area should be cleared due to blight and included with the vacant land for development potential commercial sales and offices etc account for 291% while housing occupies 213% transportation related activities including car sales parts and repair comprise 219% medicaldental total 23% and miscellaneous uses amount to 79% refer to strengthening retail trade in the tremonton area february 1992 and marketing and development manual april 199 for current information on land use parking and floor space use in the central business district 2 physical factors physical deficiencies observed in the project area include vacancies quitting business signs and conversion of retail sales to office use in addition some old structures show deterioration and offstreet parking is often unmarked and unpaved on the other hand evidence of optimism over future growth has encouraged new construction and rehabilitation of some structures an evaluation of such physical condition as curbs gutters sidewalks and street paving shows some areas missing and others deteriorating access to offstreet parking is generally poor the utah department of transportation has recently rebuilt main street which will remain a business 84 route the compactness of the central business district on main street remains attractive even though 72 tremonton city revised ordinances businesses continue to locate farther and farther out from the central business district on main street since main street is the only east and west there is a bottleneck on each end of the central business district however the one to the west by the railroad tracks will be easier to correct than the one to the west by the malad river the state is planning i15 and has constructed i84 around the city tremonton city is in favor of the plan but not the interchange location proposed on i 84 for access to tremonton which is located on 10th north instead of main street the bypass of tremonton now a fact is acceptable and should not adversely impact the city however the interchange location will make a great difference possibly adversely affecting i15 access and ability to attract potential customers to the main street area the survey of the project area also revealed other negative factors affecting the overall physical quality of the project area such as the following a evidence of obsolescence and neglect of buildings and structures b negative visual image of unmaintained and unimproved back lots and rightsofway c unsightly overhead utility lines and poles d lack of cohesive recognizable identity due to predominance of parking pavement and sidewalks without adequate landscaping e general clutter and negative appearance resulting from unscreened outside storage areas f poor aesthetic quality of some advertising signs 3 social factors at the present time approximately 150 persons reside in the project area living in 15 single family detached units and 47 multifamily structures two 2 units or more a few of the homes are among the oldest in the city and are in need of some rehabilitation to bring them up to standard homes are found adjacent to commercial uses and between them and will eventually have to give way to commercial development at the same time the higher density structures should be maintained and additional convenient housing supplied either in or near the central business district 4 economic factors the project area serves as the major retail center of the northern bear river valley thus it is important to assure its continued economic vitality economic adjustment is seen among the businesses in the project area such as a few vacant buildings and some underutilized second floor space the general assessed valuation of property in the project area inclusive of both land and building is nearly four 4 million dollars this figure does not include any personal property assessment of the premises the current assessed valuation for each block and the entire project area is shown on the assessment tabulation 7213 intent of the redevelopment plan it is the intent of this redevelopment plan to

master plan a strong and viable central business district has been the objective of the master plan developed by and for the city of tremonton this redevelopment plan reinforces that concern the guidelines for development encourage downtown redevelopment which would strengthen its viability the redevelopment plan conforms to and promotes the master plans intent 7216 report on project area redevelopment plan pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of utah as amended the following report is presented 1 the reasons for the selection of the project area the proposed redevelopment area was selected as that area within the city of tremonton having the most immediate need for treatment to stabilize strengthen and expand the commercial base of the community the boundaries of the project area were arrived at after a review of the whole business district by members of the redevelopment agency in collaboration with the consultants planned treatment of the project area will prevent and eliminate blight stimulate new development and upgrade generally to the degree necessary for sound longrange growth and development 2 the description of the physical social and economic conditions existing in the area physical social economic 3 financial analysis see h herein for proposed methods of financing redevelopment of the project area although the direction of assessed valuation and gross taxable sales in the project area has yet to be fully determined the citywide assessed valuation increased the intent of the redevelopment plan is to sustain such growth in valuation the redevelopment plan encourages commercial revitalization and expansion in the project area and subsequent increases in gross taxable sales it also attempts to encourage development in the tremonton central business district rather than outside or in another community 4 a method or plan for the relocation of families and persons to be temporarily or permanently displaced from housing facilities if any in the project area will be prepared during the annual increment beginning april 198 it is not anticipated that there will be any relocation activities if otherwise the agency shall comply with the federal uniform relocation act as adopted in 1971 and amended from time to time and the state relocation act it is the intent of the redevelopment agency to promulgate relocation standards and provide assistance to any displaced persons or business as a result of government action by the agency 5 an analysis of the preliminary plans a basis for termination of land use plan elements  all land uses and densities determined appropriate for the redevelopment plan are in accord with the general guidelines of the master plan and the applicable planning and zoning codes of tremonton major circulation routes are as provided by the citys major street plan b basis for planning criteria  planning criteria relative to land uses population densities building intensities characteristics of internal circulation systems and need and type of public improvements have not specifically been set forth in the plan it was felt that maximum flexibility in the development of acquired land and assistance to private development was needed to achieve the highest quality development that would be consistent with the citys longrange plans for redevelopment of the central business district each development proposal will be considered as a conditional use and planned unit development thus subject to the provisions of applicable requirements of the citys master plan and land development well as all other applicable development codes and ordinances c conformity with general plan and relationship to local objectives  the redevelopment plan conforms with the master plan of tremonton city in that it relates to the definite and local objectives of retaining and promoting an economically healthy and growing business district by providing adequate and desirable locations for redevelopment and uses within an atmosphere which will encourage growth the plan is related to local objectives in that the land use proposals will strengthen and increase the range of activities within the downtown area order and visual identity will be provided variety of design principles thus creating a healthy and pleasing environment for shopping working and living public improvements will be upgraded in the area thereby eliminating hazards and unsightliness and adequate offstreet parking will be provided in any new development municipal improvements and public service projects 77 6 the report and recommendation of the planning commission see below tremonton planning commission  mayor reese mason chairman tremonton city redevelopment agency city administration center tremonton utah 84337 dear mayor mason pursuant to of the utah neighborhood development act the tremonton planning commission has reviewed the proposed preliminary redevelopment plan for the tremonton central business district it is our understanding that this plan when finalized will establish the legal framework within which the city may undertake future redevelopment projects to meet specific needs and goals of tremonton we have determined that this program is consistent with our master plan for tremonton and will enhance the long term economic growth of the city by increasing its economic base and at the same time arrest further obsolescence and deterioration in the central business district therefore the planning commission recommends adoption of the proposed redevelopment plan sincerely william h myers chairman tremonton planning commission tremonton downtown survey 7251 service and market area the service area of downtown tremonton comprises box elder county except for the communities of brigham city mantua perry and willard and the southern idaho communities of malad stone and strevell the major areas of competition are brigham city and logan plus the large metropolitan areas of ogden and salt lake city the principal competition is brigham city which shares the same service area as tremonton plus the south county area not serviceable by tremonton to compete with brigham city tremonton will have to match or exceed the levels of service available in brigham city and demonstrate the fashionableness and economy of shopping in tremonton as opposed to the larger centers projected growth for the service area is a 35% increase in population over the next five 5 years based on 2000 new jobs committed by existing manufacturing plants 7252 land use land uses in downtown tremonton include residential single family residential multifamily retail sales and services financial institutions business offices and services personal services storage buildings and areas vacant lots vacant buildings and unused space in buildings generally the wide variety of land uses expected in a regional center are found in tremonton and are in the downtown area because outlying shopping centers have not fragmented the consolidated development the lack of high density housing is considered a major problem in and near the downtown area 7253 floor space existing floor space in the downtown study area was divided into the following categories 1 personal services and apparel 53275 sq feet  2 food 26850 sq feet  3 hardware 44900 sq feet  4 transportation 56875 sq feet  5 medical 11425 sq feet  6 offices and business services 55600 sq feet  7 other 67950 sq feet  8 housing 70250 sq feet  9 vacant 52025 sq feet  7254 disposable income there is an estimated 355 million dollars of annual taxable retail sales in tremonton which serves a market area of about 16000 population which has about 61 million dollars of disposable income it is estimated that per capita disposable income is $379300 these figures suggest that tremonton is losing 42% of the disposable income of its market area to the outside a 38%+ increase in disposable income is expected over the next five 5 years an increase of 23 million dollars 7255 age type of construction and condition of buildings buildings date from new to about 77 years old the earliest construction in 1904 and are mostly single story masonry construction with some two stories high some downtown renewal has taken place in recent years by remodeling and conversion of land and buildings to new uses the age of most buildings suggests that without an engineering study to the contrary the buildings do not meet seismic standards considered essential for 78 tremonton city revised ordinances public safety in fact all buildings in tremonton can be considered suspect with possibly only a few exceptions among the newest buildings recently constructed the cost of correcting deficiencies in buildings to meet minimum recommended seismic standards is believed to be exorbitant therefore all other things being equal a policy of building replacement should be encouraged rather than one of building conservation to help correct the potential safety problems perhaps even an aggressive policy of building analysis and upgrading to meet current public safety codes should be adopted basically buildings should be replaced with safer structures rather than remain and present potential safety hazards to the public however the need may not be so compelling that all buildings need be required to upgrade immediately and thus allow the process to occur over an extended period by attrition and encouragement 7256 services and utilities basic services and utilities available in downtown tremonton water police sewer fire power solid waste removal gas street maintenance telephone street lighting municipal administration both streets and alleys have been developed as utility corridors power and telephone are aerial but the telephone installations are now being buried all services appear to be adequate for the present and designed for expected growth or are being so no major deficiencies are anticipated during the next five years except the visual effects of aerial power and telephone lines 7257 public improvements offsite there is a modern city administrative center a newly reconstructed main street and other adequate community facilities but there are sections of the downtown area in need of curb gutter sidewalk or street paving either because of deterioration or nonexistence this includes improvements on both streets and alleys 7258 general appearance  aesthetics downtown tremonton appears as a typical growing us small town main street except for some vacancies and going out of business signs basically post world war ii in character the range of building ages is offset by modernized store fronts no outstanding style is common nor is it believed that one could be imposed therefore the future character and appearance lies in new contemporary buildings remodeling of existing ones and such beautification as can be achieved with landscaping the character achieved will contribute to the competitive attractiveness of tremonton with other business centers 7259 size of blocks ownership patterns blocks including alleys vary in size from about 214 acres to 234 acres and are divided by 17foot alleys the lots were originally 150 feet deep and 25 or 50 feet wide today there is both the division of and combining of lots in ownership the sizes and dimensions of the blocks and lots and ownership patterns present problems for contemporary type development and redevelopment ninetyfour 94 parcels of private land are included in this survey some are multiple lots under single ownership and none are adjoining lots of same ownership single ownership includes related ownership such as m h king and hermon e king where kings store is located most of the land is owned by absentee landlords or at least nonoccupying landlords experience suggests that there is great difficulty in managing multiple parcels under a variety of ownerships programs for improvement of multiple ownership areas are limited and difficult at best and are hard pressed to compete with single ownership or management developments such as modern shopping centers 7260 circulation and parking there are no major problems of circulation in the present downtown however as the downtown expands either west across the railroad or east to and beyond the malad river serious circulation bottlenecks will be created on main street unless additional eastwest streets are provided both north and south of main street the 1324 parking spaces counted in downtown tremonton are basically adequate for normal hours of operation but not for heavy shopping days or hours the 360 onstreet parking spaces particularly along main street are not sufficient for downtown needs and the number could vary significantly with changes to parallel parking from existing angle parking the 589 parking spaces in the parking lots to the rear and sides of stores etc are not located to be readily observed and accessible to many of the business establishments on main street nor are many of them designed or organized for efficiency in fact in some cases it is difficult to differentiate from onstreet parking due to the absence of curb gutter and sidewalk growth of downtown business activities will require additional well organized parking convenient to the user destinations since there is no way to expand onstreet parking offstreet parking lots will have to be provided to maintain desirability for downtown business new downtown expansion areas must be required to provide for adequate and municipal improvements and public service projects 79 convenient parking for their success as well as for reinforcement of the present downtown 7261 assessed value the 1980 assessed value of the study area was $72631000 for 94 parcels in private ownership wherein adjacent parcels in single ownership were considered a single lot there are some owners who own noncontiguous lots in the study area since contract sales and owners of interest are not listed  only owners of record on the tax rolls  definitive ownership is difficult if not impossible to establish for the entire area the assessed value is 20% of fair market value which would then be $3 7262 public attitudes interviews with some representative citizens and officials of tremonton indicate the resident shoppers preference for personal attention usually found in small shops in tremonton rather than the usual anonymity in the larger chain stores in larger centers the price of commodities in many cases appears to be less important than the shoppers being on a first name basis with the manager and sales people or cashiers residents from outlying communities west and north often have business in either tremonton or brigham city so the wife may shop while the husband handles other affairs or vice versa a general feeling was perceived that the residents of the area would appreciate a new supermarket in tremonton and patronize it rather than look to brigham city or other areas where new and attractive facilities exist partial findings from a questionnaire given to downtown merchants and owners include a concern about possible loss of business to the outside a general feeling was detected that expansion was needed but that it should be contiguous to or near the present downtown district not in an outlying area there was an expression of willingness to support downtown revitalization by serving on advisory committees committing to invest private capital and support civic and municipal efforts to assure a strong business center 7263 deficient goods and services aside from the usual complaints about variety and prices of available goods the modern supermarket facilities safeway and carl & dons food stores in tremonton are less than half what could be expected to serve the market area with safeways lease expiring there has been a lot of interest and competition among developers to provide a new site for an enlarged supermarket with such satellite businesses as can be attracted into adjoining space the city has been compelled to review several sites located in by and outlying the central business district the choice of sites for the next supermarket and mutually supporting shopping center will have a strong influence on the central business district it should be understood that the larger the commercial center the more competitive it can be thus the size of the market area and the concentration or size of the services directly affect its ability to satisfy market demand recommendations 7264 expand and consolidate business the two basic alternative growth patterns facing tremonton commercial expansion are consolidation of new growth into the existing downtown center and established satellites or scattered fragmentation of business into random multicenters also it is important to recognize that the larger the center the more the opportunity to provide comprehensive services it is recommended that the city adopt a strict policy of consolidated commercialization encourage and facilitate the commercialization public facilities and services intensified use and redevelopment as necessary to assure a viable downtown center with competitive enterprises also it is recommended that only sites in or adjacent to the central business district be considered in keeping with the recommended policy of business consolidation this step in the growth of the business community is so important that the city should consider using its available resources to assure the availability of a proper site other business activities should be encouraged the same way  locate correctly to assure success in the entire business community 7265 grow to serve better the anticipated 35% population growth in the next five 5 years will continue to foster speculation in commercial land development such as businesses in outlying areas on cheap land it is felt that the growth challenges offer the opportunity to enhance tremontons traditional role of being the business center for northern box elder county by providing comprehensive convenient onestop service this would mean improved selection variety of choice competition and good prices convenience and accessibility it requires reasonable locations and relationships and the satisfying feeling and confidence that people get from the assurance they are in the right place to do their business rather than a stop gap or interim activity until they can get to where they really want to be the successful center must respond to the needs of the people by providing appropriate goods and services competitively and conveniently this can best be accomplished in a consolidated system that is large enough to respond quickly and anticipate purchaser needs it is recommended that the business community plan to 710 tremonton city revised ordinances serve the new larger population in its market area better with more attractive selection and competition rather than allow business to go to more competitive regional centers in the state 7266 street improvements and storm drainage some sections of street improvements need replacing and some have not yet been installed two blocks are not included in the storm drainage system the attractiveness and function of the downtown area should be considered essential for prosperous business activities it is therefore recommended that street improvements and storm drainage facilities be completed and maintained in the downtown area 7267 plan and design for success the general accessibility of the central business district is reasonably good since it is located on a major circulation route however existing parking resembles the general makeup of the central business district in that it lacks efficient structure this inefficient structure of the central business district makes it subject to the temptation to abandon it in favor of building new more efficient centers out away from the center of development in locations where land may be cheap but where development competes to the detriment of the traditional business center rather than reinforcing it it is recommended that the central business district be planned and designed to achieve specific business goals compatible with land owner businessmen and community interests great power is necessary to accomplish such a program and such power comes of purpose and action therefore it is further recommended that the central business district owners and businessmen be organized to work together with city officials to establish common goals and mutually acceptable methods of solving problems and achieving the common goals resolution whereas the central business district of tremonton utah has been the commercial center of northern box elder county and whereas the population of northern box elder county is growing rapidly and is projected to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future due to the announced establishment of some new industries and the expansion of others and whereas there are and have been substantial threats of commercial development outside the central business district contrary to the master plan and whereas the economic welfare of the community is dependent on a strong and competitive central business district now therefore be it resolved that the central business district of tremonton generally described as the area from the railroad tracks on the west to the malad river on the east and from and including first south street on the south to and including first north on the north see legal description in  be surveyed to determine the adequacy of the central business district and its buildings land and improvements to serve the growing market area and what problems exist which might prevent it from adequately serving the growing market area to the detriment of the citizens of tremonton such study and survey are to be conducted pursuant to utah neighborhood development act title

stated in uca 1343203 b the office of the property rights ombudsman is to assist state agencies and local governments in developing the guidelines required by title 63l constitutional taking issues the guidelines contained in this provided by the office of the property rights ombudsman in an effort to provide better understanding of constitutional private property protections and the land use regulation process the guidelines below are not meant to constitute legal advice they simplify and broadly generalize complex issues of law 1 taking taking is where private property is so used or restricted that compensation is due to the property owner but no compensation or inadequate compensation is offered generally a taking occurs when one property owner or a relatively few property owners are forced to bear a significant burden so that the public in general or a relatively large number of property owners can receive a benefit 2 basic elements of a taking the basic elements of a taking include a an action but not a negligent emergency or other exempt action  b to occupy damage or interfere with  c protected private property  d by a government entity or private entity acting under government authority  e for a public purpose  and f without the payment of just compensation 3 physical takings a physical occupation of the property a physical occupation of property by the government or someone acting with government authority such as a utility or a contractor working for the government is always a taking if the occupation is permanent and advances a public purpose 1 an example of physical occupation of property includes placing a cable box on the outside of an apartment building loretto v teleprompter manhattan catv corp 458 us 419 1982 2 an example of a physical occupation of property includes allowing waters to occupy private property repeatedly or permanently colman v utah state land board 795 p2d 622 1990 pigs gun club v sanpete county 2002 ut 17 3 an example of a physical occupation of property includes requiring the landowner to endure continual trespass or public access on private lands dolan v tigard 512 us 374 1994 b physical damaging by governmentcreated nuisance when some government activity or action rises to the level of an actionable nuisance which usually involves some government activity on public property that is near to or adjoins the land that is claimed to suffer an unconstitutional burden the issue in such cases is whether the government activity is so unreasonable as to constitute an actionable interference with the quiet enjoyment of property 1 an example of physical damaging by governmentcreated nuisance includes airport corridors  noise and vibration katsos v salt lake city corp 624 f supp 100 us dist ct utah 1986 2 an example of physical damaging by governmentcreated nuisance includes nuisances in general see logan city school district v croft 13 utah 2d 310 373 p2d 697 1962 schoolyard noises not a factor in damages in eminent domain action c physical interference with a protected property right when a physical action interferes with one of the specific aspects of property ownership that has been listed as separately protected 1 an example of physical interference with a protected property right includes right to air light and view across a street such as building an overpass in the street in front of residential lots utah state road comm v miya 526 p2d 926 1974 2 an example of physical interference with a protected property right includes loss of functionality due to changes in curb cuts on a city street three d corp v salt lake city 752 p2d 1321 ut ct app 1988 carpet barn v state of utah 795 p2d 1138 ut ct app 1990 3 an example of physical interference with a protected property right includes right to reasonable access hampton v state ex rel road commission 21 utah 2d 342 445 p2d 708 1968 d regulations that interfere with a vested right once a property owner has established the right to a particular use of land the government may not revoke that right 1 an example of regulations that interfere with a vested right includes nonconforming uses which were legal when the regulations were passed but would be illegal under existing law also have protected status as vested rights if not abandoned or amortized under the terms of an amortization ordinance see uca 109103 cases considering the establishment and continuation of nonconforming uses include rock manor trust v state rd commn 550 p2d 205 utah 1976 nonconforming use survives destruction of the building by fire caster v west valley city 2001 ut app 220 nonconforming use not abandoned if any of several alternative activities defined as part of that use are continued and hugoe trucking v woods cross 1999 ut app 281 since use was established before an it has vested and may continue 4 regulatory takings a regulations which impose disproportionate burdens an action may be unconstitutional if it is deemed unfair in an analysis of three factors 1 the burden placed on the property owner 2 the nature of the government action and benefit and 3 the property owners investmentbacked expectations 1 an example of regulations which impose disproportionate burdens include denial of right to build office tower over historic landmark not a taking when weighing all factors involved in an ad hoc inquiry penn central transp co v city of new york 98 s ct 2646 1978 2 an example of regulations which impose a disproportionate burden include where there was no deprivation of all economic value in wetlands case the court remanded for a takings analysis based on the penn central balancing test see concurring opinion by justice oconner regarding the penn central balancing test in palazzolo v state of rhode island 121 s ct 2448 2001 a thirtytwo month development moratorium was not held to be a taking because after balancing all factors involved the delay involved was not unreasonable the burden of this particular moratorium must be weighed in light of the significant community value represented by the purity of the waters of lake tahoe preservation of the quality of the lake would eventually enhance both property values and the public good adequate time must be taken to carefully plan for community development even if a complete denial of all use is imposed for a finite and reasonable period tahoe sierra preservation council v tahoe regional planning authority 122 s ct 146 2002 b regulations that interfere with a protected property right when an ordinance or statute or other government action results in an unreasonable interference with a protected aspect of property ownership 1 an example of regulations that interfere with a protected property right include right to pass property
