e2 adopted  article 303 floodplain management regulations authorization the legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act texas water as amended delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of cedar park of travis and williamson county texas does ordain as follows c1 adopted  of fact    56526 a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by

area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of

all hardwood trees six 6 caliper inches and larger measured fourandonehalf feet above ground level and shall include all tree locations caliper inches and types the plat is not required to show the crown area trees shall be represented by circles using the formula of one foot of radius for every one 1 inch of trunk caliper unbroken circles shall indicate trees that will remain and dashed circles shall indicate trees proposed for removal 1 tree surveys must be as accurate as possible but need not be certified levels of inaccuracy which will result in a failure to comply with the city tree preservation design criteria and construction specifications may necessitate new surveys and plan adjustments either prior to permit approval or project release 2 for small areas with few trees taping the distance to the center of the trunk from two 2 known points is a viable option for large treecovered sites using a total station survey system from a platform elevated above the tree line may be the most practical method    298526 3 caliper inches of existing trees are measured at fourandonehalf 412 feet above grade if the tree is on a slope measure from the high side of the slope measure above or below unusual swells in the trunk a to determine the caliper inch of a multitrunk tree measure all the trunks  add the total caliper inch of the largest trunk to onehalf 12 the caliper inch of each additional trunk a multitrunk tree is differentiated from individual trees growing from a common root stock if there is a visible connection between the trunks aboveground b caliper inch measurements should be accurate to the nearest onehalf 12 inch this data is used in the determination of tree significance and replacement value if necessary c trees may be measured with a caliper cruise stick standard tape measure or diameter tape d trees defined by their size and location as protected trees shall be noted as such and measured as shown 4 tree types should be accurate to the species level eg post oak spanish oak cedar elm etc tree types may be listed by common names or botanical names additional information which would greatly aid project designers and reviewers in their efforts would include crown configuration crown clearance condition and tree number 5 if there is an area which is known at the time of the survey to be on the project site or easement but outside the buildable area a limitofconstruction line may be established trees beyond this line need not be surveyed provided the following conditions are met a the limits of construction must be fenced throughout all phases of construction b a general description of the numbers types and sizes of trees in the area beyond the limits of construction must be provided as a plan note 6 the standard tree graphics discussed below are important to provide consistent information in the most useful format for efficient plan review a the trunk location on the plan must represent the center of the trunk at ground level in the field if the tree leans substantially above that point show the direction of the lean with an arrow for example an oak tree with a trunk caliper measuring fifteen 15 inches would be represented to scale on plans with a fifteenfoot circle b trees are to be represented on plans by a concentric circle centered on the trunk location with a diameter equal in feet to twice the number of inches of the trees trunk caliper inches i the area within the circle is referred to as the critical root zone crz the crz is used by plan reviewers to determine compliance with design standards and construction specifications ii a circle is graphically efficient to produce and represents the most likely configuration of a trees root pattern even when the crown is skewed or one sided the ratio of circle diameter to trunk caliper inch is based on typical dripline distances noted on open grown trees with full crowns the dripline standard for critical root zone area is being used as a practical meter despite the fact that a trees roots often extend two 2 to three 3 times beyond the dripline iii trees proposed to be retained are to be represented by a solid circle trees proposed to be removed are to be represented by a dashed circle iv trees proposed to be planted are to be graphically differentiated from existing trees c tree caliper inches and types shall be shown on the plan this information should be shown adjacent to each trunk location d for very large sites with many trees this data may be shown in legend form referenced by a tree number adjacent to each trunk location subject to the following restrictions i legends must be shown on the plan sheets on which the corresponding trees appear  or ii legends may be submitted in book format for review purposes but the legend sic b tree preservation design criteria 1 critical root zone impacts a trees root system ranges well beyond the dripline the critical root zone crz has been established to set a practical limit beyond which any loss of roots would not have a significant impact on a trees survival design constraints often    299526 dictate that trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on their critical root zone weighing this fact with what appears to be an acceptable degree of risk to most trees the following minimum design criteria maximum allowable impacts have been established a a minimum of fifty percent 50% of the critical root zone shall be preserved at natural grade with natural ground cover b no cut or fill greater than four 4 inches shall be located closer to the tree trunk than one half 12 the crz radius distance c this standard requires that construction impacts associated with various design features be considered for example the installation of a curb typically requires excavation of two 2 feet behind the back of curb in such a case the line of impact on the crz will be two 2 feet behind the curbline shown on the plan 2 in order to assure that the remaining root zones are adequately preserved project designers should show the tree protection fence locations on plans for those trees with crz infringements 3 the following is the minimum design criteria maximum allowable impact for tree crowns a a maximum of thirty percent 30% of the viable portion of a trees crown may be removed b construction methods must also be considered when implementing this design standard for example a building wall may only require the removal of thirty percent 30% of the crown but the scaffolding necessary to construct the building may require the removal of another twenty percent 20% of the crown 4 these criteria represent minimum standards for determining whether or not a tree is preserved greater impacts may be allowed provided that all design alternatives have been proven unfeasible and that some acceptable form of mitigation such as a remedial care program is negotiated conversely some cases may require that a larger area of root zone be preserved to increase the survival potential of particularly significant trees 5 these design criteria are enforced in the field as well as on the plan plan adjustments made during construction must be reviewed and approved by the director of development services or their designee 6 fifty percent 50% of the existing number of trees or total caliper inches of trees on site that are eightinch caliper or greater and are from species included in the preferred plant list or of equivalent value shall be retained and protected 7 the existing hardwood trees surveyed between 6 and 79 and retained on site may count toward the site tree cover and mitigation of heritage and protected trees pursuant to subsection c and d herein as amended at a ratio of 0 c preservation of protected trees 1 general requirements a except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 or in accordance with subsection 1b of this section it is unlawful to remove a protected tree without written approval of

analysis purpose this article shall be known as the traffic impact analysis requirements the traffic impact analysis requirements acknowledge and respond to the relationship between land uses and the vehicular traffic generated by those uses on public roadways the purpose of these requirements is to adopt methods to assess the traffic related impacts at the time significant land use decisions regarding property within the city limits and etj of the city are made 1998 sec  provisions a a traffic impact analysis tia is a study that provides information on the projected traffic likely to be generated by a proposed development and to assess its impact on the roadways in the immediate proximity of a proposed development the tia should identify any potential traffic operational problems or concerns and recommend appropriate action to address such problems or concerns b a traffic impact analysis shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section and the transportation criteria manual the geographic area to be considered in the tia shall be established by the director of planning the tia should consider and account for the potential traffic generated by other undeveloped sites within the established boundaries c a neighborhood traffic analysis is a simplified traffic impact analysis that assesses the impact of a proposed project on residential streets a neighborhood traffic analysis is limited to an evaluation of existing and projected operating levels of residential streets and an identification of mitigation measures needed to minimize traffic impacts 1998 sec  of requirements a tia requirements apply to each individual lot or tract of land under the following circumstances 1 when an application is made to zone or rezone  2 when an

lake travis withdrawal contract with lcra the city uses floating dock pump stations that are able to withdraw surface water at various stage elevations as the lakes conservation pool varies in response to flooding and drought conditions the city along with the bcrua is in the planning stages of a project that will allow for it to be prepared to establish a deeper stage intake than is currently capable that would provide it the ability to withdraw raw water at a lake elevation of about 570 feet above mean sea level such action would provide the city with the ability to secure reservoir withdrawals based upon a lake elevation that is set to the historical extreme conditions caused by the 1950s drought of record this additional component to the citys reservoir operations plan should allow the water utility to provide a reliable longterm raw water supply to the city even during the most serious drought conditions conservation coordinator the city has budgeted and
