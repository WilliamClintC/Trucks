including a street reconstruction of existing asphalt and concrete streets including construction from a rural to an urban roadway with new curb and gutter and including additional lanes of travel b utility reconstruction c asphalt or concrete street resurfacing d stormwater management facilities that are not required for an existing developed parcel but rather constructed to meet the overall city requirements for regulatory permitting e sidewalk replaced due to grade change utility replacement andor damage by trees in city rightofway f street light additions to existing streets g new construction of arterial street improvements where access to the arterial street from such parcel is prohibited arterial street for purposes of this section means principal and minor arterial roads as

improvements assessable improvements are public infrastructure street construction and sidewalk construction improvements which confer special upon abutting property public infrastructure includes water storm sewer and sanitary sewer but does not include sewer capacity charges from a metropolitan sewerage district assessable improvements include a new infrastructure construction to a new development new streets storm sanitary water et al b new utility construction to an existing andor developed parcel such as water main sanitary sewer or storm sewer c new or additional laterals to an existing lot d stormwater management facilities that provide a benefit to a new or existing parcel to be redeveloped eliminating the requirement for onsite treatment e driveway aprons for new projects

or property abutting two or more municipal jurisdictions will be assessed to all benefitting properties with assessments collected by the city upon annexation or intergovernmental agreement 3 assessment methodologies a front foot method when this method is used benefit is determined to be proportional to the front footage of the property as follows i assessable footages for improvement will be the linear foot as measured along the building setback line extended to intersect with the property line when determining assessable footage all property adjacent to and benefited by the improvement will be assessed this includes all publically owned property improvements constructed within the intersection will be assessed to the benefited properties ii on corner lots that have or will have new infrastructure in each street adjacent to the property for the entire length of each side a reduction of onethird the combined total lot footage as measured along the building setback line is made up to a maximum of 60 feet on corner lots that will have new infrastructure on only one street assessable footage is measured along the building setback line on the side where the utility is installed with no reduction made iii in the event that new infrastructure is constructed on the front and back of a property and there is no ability to split the property the property will be assessed at the footage along the building setback line on the side of lot where the property is connected to the new infrastructure iv when new utility construction associated with new development is constructed along a property line common to adjacent interior lots the assessable footage will be measured as a standard interior lot having a utility constructed in the street disregarding the fact it may have a utility on two sides of the lot b lot or connection method the lot or connection method allocates costs and special assessments on the assumption that every lot or every connection to the public facilities received the same benefit regardless of the difference in the size or shape of the lot the use of this neighborhood and there exists some uniformity as to the types of uses on the property c regional method the regional method allocates cost for improvements to benefitting properties based on area or flow in the case of improvements such as interceptor sewer costs including those from the green bay metropolitan sewerage district lift stations and force mains water towers and regional storm water management facilities benefits would be normally more closely associated with an area or a calculated flow generation the use of this method will require establishment of a per unit cost for the specific improvement which will the net developable area or calculated flow rate for areas receiving the improvement d square foot method the square foot method allocates costs based on the square foot of an improvement that a property receives costs are determined based on the actual cost to provide the benefit this method is generally used for driveway and sidewalk improvements e combination methods a combination of methods may be required for a specific project in particular on new development for new contiguous development improvement costs are paid by the developer all assessable costs are generally calculated on a per lot basis for new noncontiguous development improvement costs are calculated on a combination of front foot and per lot basis as follows i costs for utility extensions to service the development are calculated on a per front foot basis all properties that benefit from the installation of the new utility will be assessed on a linear foot basis as determined by the engineer properties that do not benefit from the new utility will not be assessed if the new utility is installed for the need of the new development the developer will be responsible for all nonbenefitting utility costs ii costs for improvements internal to the new development are generally calculated on a per lot basis the costs for utilities at nonbenefitting properties will be generally included in the per lot basis b new development extension of

adopted oct 4 201 repealed the former ch 28  2812815 and enacted a new chapter as set out herein the former ch 28 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted feb 3 2009 authority a this chapter is adopted by the common council under the authority granted by wis stats   this chapter supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted that relate to stormwater management regulations except as otherwise specified in wis stats   wis stats  6223 applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter b the provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body c the common council hereby designates the director of public works or designee to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter d the requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following 1 the wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats  28116 and 28333 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under  nr  wis adm  1042016 findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities f threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes g undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  1042016 purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property 4 minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state b intent it is the intent of the common council that this chapter regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this chapter may be applied on a sitebysite basis the common council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats  28116 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community  1042016 applicability and jurisdiction a

created created a purpose the common council finds that continued city collection of commercial source recyclables and garbage has led to the proliferation of recycling and garbage carts in the citys downtown commercial areas resulting in access restrictions to businesses and public parking areas and sanitary and aesthetic concerns further commercial building footprints in the historic downtown commercial areas typically encumber the entire parcel leaving little or no room for public or private refuse container storage or screening allowing few options to avoid the detrimental impact caused by the presence of individual recycle and garbage carts on collection days or when stored between collection days wis stats  authorizes the city to create districts for the collection of refuse defined by type of property although both the east and west side commercial business areas exhibit the detrimental impact on aesthetics and access caused by multiple containers on public parking property each collection day the number of commercial businesses properties contributing to the problem on the east side is far less than on the west side further the configuration of business properties on the west side is compact due to the presence of the nicolet square parking mall providing the city an opportunity to implement a novel approach to prevent the deleterious effects the proliferation of recyclable and garbage containers has on the historic downtown commercial properties the common council is mindful that it has not before set apart public property for the purpose of
