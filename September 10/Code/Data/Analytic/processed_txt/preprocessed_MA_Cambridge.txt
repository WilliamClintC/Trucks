title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no

versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the number for example section  is section 010 in chapter 204 of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents

institutional purposes in residentially zoned districts which require a lot of one thousand two hundred 1200 square feet or more per dwelling unit shall be governed by the provisions of this 52 purpose it is the purpose of this to protect lower density residential neighborhoods from unlimited expansion of institutional activities to reduce pressures for conversion of the existing housing stock to nonresidential uses to minimize the development of activities which are different from and incompatible with activity patterns customarily found in lower density residential neighborhoods and to provide a framework for allowing those institutions which are compatible with residential neighborhoods to locate and expand there this is intended to accomplish these purposes in a manner consistent with the findings and objectives of the community development departments cambridge institutional growth management plan 1981 453 approach this establishes special use regulations for institutional activities in the residence a1 a2 b c and c1 zoning districts these regulations encompass the full range of institutional uses each use is regulated based on its expected physical impacts on nearby residences on the existing or recent use of the lot or structure proposed for such use and on the location of the lot either within or outside of an area in which there has already been extensive institutional development 454 institutional overlay district the designation institutional overlay district is hereby established on the zoning map as provided for in an institutional overlay district delimits an area where there has been extensive contiguous development of institutional use types subject to regulation under this institutional overlay districts are defined in order to identify areas where prior development patterns create a precedent for more flexible institutional use regulation than in areas where non institutional uses predominate the conditions regarding development of new or expanded institutional uses under subsections 455 and 456 are determined in part by whether a lot is located inside or outside an institutional overlay district the boundaries of these districts are drawn based on several physical factors  consequently for purposes of definitional clarity they encompass areas both inside and outside zoning districts subject to use regulation under this regardless of the location of an institutional overlay district boundary the special institutional use regulations of this shall only apply within the residence a1 a2 b c and c1 districts the following institutional overlay districts are hereby established on the zoning map  the harvard radcliffe lesley district  the episcopal divinity school district  the observatory hill district

the column heading in refers to the types of lot status listed in applies to institutional development whether by conversion of an existing structure or lot or by new construction or new use of a lot  the existing lot status pertaining to the proposed institutional development shall be defined according to one of the following three types 1 a lot which contains a residential use listed in or which

particularly appropriate on the lot given previous use of the lot 6 institutional use would be particularly appropriate on the lot given institutional use of adjacent or nearby lots 7 residential development would not be feasible or reasonably practical on the site 8 the proposed institutional use would create a stronger buffer or a more gentle transition between residential and nonresidential areas 9 the proposed institutional use would result in a net improvement to the neighborhood by being more compatible than the previous use of the lot detriments 1 development of the institutional use would substantially contravene the objectives of the cambridge institutional growth management plan 2 the intensity of the institutional use would be substantially greater than the use intensity of residences in the neighborhood including traffic building bulk parking demands etc 3 the activity patterns including pedestrian and vehicle travel to and from the institution would differ from existing neighborhood activity patterns so as to adversely impact the neighborhood 4 development of an institutional use would eliminate existing dwelling units 5 development of an institutional use

shall be made in the following manner 1 h is the height of the building l is the length of the wall measured parallel to the corresponding lot or street line the front yard is measured from the street line or building line where such has been established except where otherwise indicated herein for buildings of forty 40 feet or less in height the denominator in the yard formulas in the tables in may be increased by two subject to the minimum yard requirements set forth in footnotes a b and c of tables 51 and 52 2 where a building consists of various roof levels an average height or h may be used in the required yard formula average height is determined by adding the products of the height of each roof level facing the given lot line h1 h2 etc times the length of each roof level l1 l2 etc and dividing the sum by the sum of the length of the levels l1 l2 etc see formula below average height   h1 x l1 + h2 x l2 l1 + l2 3 where a building presents a variety of vertical planes to any given lot or street line no plane shall be closer to the street or building line or lot line than permitted by the application to such plane of the appropriate formula in the tables of dimensional requirements in for all planes set forward of the setback line required by said tables for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane other planes must be set behind the setback line so calculated the result shall be that the sum of the products of the setback required for each plane times the facing area of each plane respectively shall be at least as great as the product of the setback required by the appropriate table for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane times the facing area of the building if viewed as a single plane see illustration below the product of setback1 x facing area1 + setback2 x facing area2 must equal or exceed the product of single plane setback x single plane facing area 525 far exceptions for parking and loading

parking facility in a structure is proposed to be constructed a in the 100year flood plain identified as the zone a flood hazard area see  or as determined by credible evidence and calculations from a registered professional engineer or b on a contaminated site that is listed by the massachusetts department of environmental protection under the massachusetts contingency plan 310 cmr 4000 with a release tracking number and has been tier classified the planning board may grant a special permit to waive the limitations of this so that the parking facility is not subject to the requirements in this to floor area ratio provided only the minimum number of parking spaces required for the uses on the site are provided in granting such a special permit the planning board shall find the following 1 where in a flood hazard area the construction of a parking facility underground is a not technically feasible due to the requirements of the massachusetts wetlands protection act mgl ch 131 s40 b would require construction that would violate requirements or limitations of the massachusetts wetlands protection act c would in the view of the cambridge conservation commission seriously compromise the wetlands protection objectives of the massachusetts wetlands protection act and d would result in costs of construction that are significantly greater than would otherwise be typical for the location were it not in a flood hazard area  or 2 where the site is contaminated the construction of a parking facility underground a would in the opinion of a licensed site professional pose significant risks to public health or the environment of hazardous materials and could not be reasonably mitigated in accordance with state and federal regulations b require construction that is prohibited by state or federal regulations related to hazardous wastes and c would result in costs of construction that would render the project financially unfeasible  and 3 the above ground facility is designed so as to reduce its actual or perceived bulk among other possible techniques limiting the number of parking spaces it contains placement of portions of the facility below grade where feasible or its location relative to actively occupied portions of the construction construction above grade is discouraged that would increase the amount of impervious area on the lot 526 conversion

principal use structure designed and built for non residential use to residential use excluding transient accommodations and trailer park or mobile home park listed in ij the dimensional standards generally applicable in the district as set forth in the tables of dimensional requirements in other applicable regulations in this including permitted uses table of use regulations shall apply however where some or all of those requirements cannot be met including any use dimensional or procedural requirement that may apply in the base district the following provisions shall apply to such conversion after issuance of a special permit by the planning board the provisions in this apply in all zoning districts with the exception of districts with an open space designation 58 intent of this a to allow the economic reuse of buildings that may be substantially out of compliance with the dimensional requirements of the zoning district within which they are located especially as they are converted to residential use b to encourage the preservation of buildings of historic or cultural significance by providing opportunities for reuse of the structures c to establish a framework of development standards and criteria within which existing nonresidential buildings that are out of scale and character with surrounding residential uses can be converted to housing of an appropriate style and density while limiting potential negative impacts on neighbors  allowed uses the planning board may permit uses not otherwise allowed in the base zoning district subject to the following conditions and limitations a the permitted uses shall be limited to the following 1 all residential uses listed in ah but specifically excluding transient accommodations and trailer park or mobile

floor or basement of the building the planning board may permit nonresidential uses to occupy other floors of the building only after determining that the location and design of such spaces including access and egress will not impact the privacy or security of residential occupants however the total floor area occupied by nonresidential uses shall not exceed the floor area of the ground floor and basement c the planning board shall determine that any proposed nonresidential uses are generally compatible with residential uses in the area including the dwelling units located within the same building and will not cause harm or nuisance to surrounding uses 59 d the planning board shall determine that by permitting nonresidential uses there will be a compensating reduction in the number of dwelling units that would otherwise be permitted and that the proposed nonresidential uses will balance the potential adverse impacts of additional residential units such as demand for nighttime parking  gross floor area the gross floor area permitted shall be that which is the result of the application of the far permitted in the district in which the structure is located or the existing gross floor area of the structure itself whichever is greater however the planning board may permit additional gross floor area to be added to the non residential structure without limit provided all construction creating additional gross floor area occurs within the physical limits of the existing structure where it is proposed to add gross floor area above what would normally be allowed in the zoning district the planning board shall determine that such additional floor area is necessary to accommodate a reasonable arrangement and layout of residential units within the existing structure if gross floor area is added to an existing structure such that the resulting gross floor area is greater than twice what would be allowed under normal zoning district regulations including the inclusionary housing provisions of applicable then half the amount of gross floor area added to the existing structure such that it exceeds twice the normal district limit shall be deducted from the total gross floor area of the structure for the purpose of calculating the maximum permissible number of dwelling units under for projects of at least 30000 square feet or twenty 20 dwelling units for which the total gross floor area is greater than twice what would be allowed under normal zoning district regulations including the inclusionary housing provisions of applicable no more than seventy percent 70% of the projects total gross floor area shall be occupied by living space within private dwelling units and the remaining gross floor area shall be occupied by common areas such as hallways stairways lobbies fitnessrecreational spaces common storage areas abovegrade parking facilities laundry or other resident services or approved nonresidential uses  dwelling units the number of dwelling units permitted shall be the number of dwelling units allowed under normal zoning district regulations including the inclusionary housing provisions of applicable however the planning board may permit a greater number of dwelling units with the maximum permissible number of units determined by dividing the gross floor area of the structure as permitted in after subtracting any gross floor area occupied exclusively by nonresidential uses as permitted under by 1100 square feet for the first ten 10 units and by 1900 square feet for any additional units 510 if a portion of the dwelling units meet the definition of elderly oriented housing notwithstanding the number of such units within the building the planning board may permit the number of units to exceed the allowed maximum only for the specific purpose of accommodating such units which may be smaller than conventional housing units  yard requirements the required yards shall be those of the structure existing at the time of the conversion to residential use however any construction occurring outside the limits of the existing structure shall be subject to the yard requirements of the district in which the structure is located  maximum height the maximum height shall be that height permitted in the district in which the structure is located or the building height whichever is greater however any construction that occurs outside the existing limits of the structure other than construction exempt from the height limit as set forth in shall be subject to the maximum height limit of the district in which the structure is located  private open space requirements the private open space requirement shall be that required in the district in which the structure is located except as modified herein the dimensional and locational limitations for private open space set forth in shall not apply  any combination of atgrade private open space and decks and balconies at other levels shall be permitted as shall walks intended for non vehicular use however in every case where those requirements of waived by this paragraph a are not met all portions of the surface of the lot shall be green area as defined in are 1 not covered by the building or 2 devoted to the minimum area necessary to provide at grade conforming parking spaces and the minimum necessary circulation and driveways for no more than one parking space per dwelling unit the amount of private open space required may be reduced by the planning board should the board find that full compliance cannot reasonably be expected given the existing development of the lot and the provision of parking necessary to serve the dwelling units however where open space requirements are not met the applicant shall explore the use of portions of the interior of the building to provide recreational opportunities not possible on the exterior  conforming additions conforming additions to such nonresidential structures shall be permitted without reference to the limitations set forth in for such additions to nonconforming structures 511  required parking offstreet parking shall be provided as required in the schedule of parking and loading requirements in instances where 636 does not apply due to the proposed use not being allowed in the base zoning district required offstreet parking for approved residential uses shall be provided at a rate of one space per dwelling unit and required offstreet parking for nonresidential uses shall be determined by the planning board after reviewing the requirements for that use within other zoning districts  criteria for approval of a special permit in acting upon this special permit the planning board shall consider the standards and criteria set forth in 47 and  of this addition to the following review standards 1 criteria applicable to all projects a provision of parking where it is proposed to add dwelling units above the limits established in the base zoning regulations the board shall evaluate the impact of increased numbers of dwelling units above that normally permitted in the district on the demand for onstreet parking by residents and visitors to the proposed building particularly in neighborhoods where off street parking is limited in reaching a determination the board may require that the applicant provide elements of a parking analysis as set forth in the zoning a project is subject to additional criteria as specified in below a parking analysis shall be required to be included with the special permit application b privacy considerations where significant variations from the normally required dimensional standards for the district are proposed the board shall evaluate the impact on residential neighbors of the new housing use and any other proposed use as it may affect privacy the location and size of windows screening elements decks entries security and other lighting and other aspects of the design including the distribution of functions within the building shall be reviewed in order to assure the maintenance of reasonable levels of privacy for abutters in reviewing a proposed development plan the board shall consider among other factors the potential negative impacts of the new activity on abutters as a result of the location orientation and use of the structures and its yards as proposed c reduction in private open space where it is proposed to reduce the amount of onsite private open space below that required in the applicable district the board shall evaluate the proposal in light of the following 1 the extent to which screening and buffering from neighbors will be accomplished 2 the quality and viability of the proposed open spaces as they are designed 3 the tradeoff in benefits and negative impacts of the loss of green space in order to provide the required amount of parking including consideration of the feasibility 512 of alternate parking arrangements that might produce additional green area such as placing some or all parking within the structure 4 the availability of common recreational spaces within the building to compensate for the loss of usable outdoor open space d community outreach the planning board shall consider what reasonable efforts have been made to address concerns raised by abutters and neighbors to the project site an applicant seeking a special permit under this solicit input from affected neighbors before submitting a special permit application the application shall include a report on all outreach conducted and meetings held shall describe the issues raised by community members and shall describe how the proposal responds to those issues 2 additional criteria applicable to larger projects where the proposed project includes more than 10000 gross square feet or more than ten 10 dwelling units and the proposed gross floor area or number of dwelling units is above the maximum allowed under base zoning regulations the board shall evaluate the proposal in light of the following a the implications of the size or number of additional dwelling units on the anticipated demand for parking in order to assist the planning board in evaluating parking impacts an applicant for a special permit shall be required to submit a parking analysis as set forth in the zoning as part of the special permit application b the appropriateness of the proposed layout of floor space within the building for a multifamily residential use with attention to the typical range of unit sizes and types that would be expected for housing in the neighborhood considerations may include the suitability of proposed unit configurations for a variety of households the extent to which unusual unit sizes or shapes may impact parking or overall quality of life for neighbors and the availability of customary amenities for residents such as storage utilities common rooms and recreational facilities c the potential mitigating effects of the proposed occupancy of dwelling units for instance units designed for elderly residents or livework spaces for professionals or artists may provide desirable housing options for cambridge residents with fewer adverse impacts on parking or neighborhood character 513 530 district dimensional regulations  rules for applying certain provisions of the tables of dimensional requirements  far and height where two numbers appear in column 1

otherwise adversely impact the neighborhood or that such lesser amount of parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot and the neighborhood including specifically among other benefits assisting in the provision of affordable housing units in making such a determination the board shall also consider whether or not less off street parking is reasonable in light of the following 1 the availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being served andor the proximity of an mbta transit station 2 the availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use being served provided the requirements of are satisfied 3 shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user demands at different times provided that no more than seventyfive 75 percent of the lesser minimum parking requirements for each use shall be satisfied with such shared spaces and that the requirements of are satisfied example office and theatre uses with peak user demands at different times office requires a minimum of one hundred and fifty 150 spaces and the theatre requires a minimum of one hundred 100 seventyfive 75 percent of the lesser minimum requirement is seventyfive 75 75% of 100 therefore seventyfive 75 spaces can be shared but twentyfive 25 10025 would still be required making the total amount or required parking for both uses 150 + 25 one hundred and seventyfive 175 4 age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of auto usage  and 611 5 impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot or the adjacent lots including reduction in green space destruction of significant existing trees and other vegetation destruction of existing dwelling units significant negative impact on the historic resources on the lot impairment of the urban design objectives of the city as set forth in of the zoning or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways 6 the provision of required parking for developments containing affordable housing units and especially for developments employing the increased far and dwelling unit density provisions of will increase the cost of the development will require variance relief from other zoning requirements applicable to the development because of limitations of space on the lot or will significantly diminish the environmental quality for all residents of the development for a project seeking a reduction in required offstreet parking for residential uses a parking analysis shall be required as part of the special permit application as set forth in exceeding maximum allowed parking any maximum allowed amount of parking may be exceeded only upon issuance of a special permit from the planning board any parking area in excess of the maximum limitation will have an impact on calculation of gross floor area as provided at the planning board shall grant a special permit to allow exceedance of a maximum limitation only upon making the following determinations 1 reasonable parking and transportation demand management measures are being implemented to reduce the need for the additional off street parking  2 the additional spaces reflect parking demand that exceeds that which is common for this use as categorized in owing to unique characteristics of the users or the activity that result in a high level of automobile parking demand  3 the additional parking demand cannot reasonably be accommodated or other arrangement making use of available offsite parking  4 the additional parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot to the neighborhood and the city which outweigh adverse effects after consideration of the following congestion traffic increases on residential streets danger to public safety or deterioration of travel conditions for pedestrians cyclists or users of public transit in its decision the planning board shall cite evidence supporting its determinations and may impose such conditions as are necessary to mitigate all negative impacts on the neighborhood and the environment which would otherwise result from the greater allowed amount of parking  parking analysis  the purpose of a parking analysis is to provide quantitative data to assist a special permit granting authority in considering certain projects a parking analysis shall be submitted where it is specifically required by any provision of this zoning special permit granting authority may also request that elements of a parking analysis be provided when considering a project that proposes a deviation from parking requirements specified in the zoning an increase in development density above the maximum allowed asofright under base zoning regulations  where a parking analysis is specifically required by any provision of this zoning the proponent shall first consult with the traffic parking and transportation department to determine the scope and methodology of such an analysis the results of the parking analysis shall be included in any special permit application for the project  for residential projects a parking analysis shall include some or all of the following with the specific type and level of analysis to be determined by the traffic parking and transportation department based on the relevant characteristics of the proposal a estimates of the projects parking demand as evidenced by vehicle ownership rates and peak parking occupancy data for comparable nearby residential projects resident parking permit and motor vehicle registration data for the area andor other indicators of parking demand these estimates should account for daytime and nighttime parking estimates may account for differences in parking demand given the occupancy of units such as owneroccupied vs rental units marketrate vs belowmarketrate units or elderlyoriented vs conventional units estimates may also account for anticipated vacancy rates b maps showing the distance to alternate transportation options in the area including mbta rapid transit stations and bus routes bike facilities and carsharing services c studies of onstreet parking capacity and utilization in the vicinity of the project such studies should be conducted at night and should account for the normal activity hours of other land uses in the area d where applicable inventories and peak occupancy data for nearby offsite parking that will be available to the projects residents or visitors either on a roundtheclock basis or by way of a shared use arrangement private offsite parking shall only be applicable to the analysis if a longterm leasing arrangement is proposed to be made shared parking arrangements should be studied thoroughly to determine the minimum amount of parking required to satisfy the demand from all proposed land uses during any given time period e a description of measures that will be implemented to reduce demand for private automobile use such as the availability of carsharing programs andor incentives for residents or employees to walk bicycle or use public transportation and estimates of the anticipated impact of those measures on parking demand 636 schedule of parking and loading requirements off street parking shall be provided as shown in the

for kendall squares continued prominence as a worldrenowned center of innovation and a vibrant neighborhood creation of a mixeduse district of high quality general and technical office and laboratory uses with significant retail activity proximate to the mbta station the pud5 district helps organize placement of commercial and institutional buildings and establishes an additional mixeduse development containing a significant residential component to support the burgeoning residential corridor along third street and the strong links to existing neighborhoods and the riverfront the pud5 district allows for continued support of the academic mission at mit and encourages connective links physical and otherwise between the institute and adjacent neighborhoods the pud5 district responds to the kendall square planning process and is intended to be a smartgrowth transitoriented district and therefore allows for replacing surface parking lots with larger scale development in kendall square and the major public transit services located there the pud5 district encourages low parking ratios shared parking strategies the use of public transportation and improved pedestrian and bicycle environments the pud5 district furthers the citys goals for sustainable development sites that are planned designed and constructed in a sustainable way so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts as they are initially constructed and as they are occupied and operated over the course of their useful lives the pud5 district promotes the creation of a strong retail corridor along main street and the enhancement of broad canal way combined this new public crossroads will have broad appeal as a desirable destination during and beyond the traditional workday by providing a critical

special permit 1930 urban design objectives 1940 advisory development consultation procedures 1950 building and site plan requirements 1910 intent and purpose of intent of this to establish traffic and urban design standards for development projects likely to have significant impact on abutting properties and the surrounding urban environment to realize this intent 1 codifies the citys urban design objectives and establishes detailed building and site development standards to regulate new building construction in the citys commercial and high density residential areas 2 establishes standards by which significant adverse traffic impacts can be measured and 3 establishes procedures by which individual proposals can be reviewed by the planning board city staff and the general public before a building permit is issued the building and site plan requirements describe the minimally acceptable arrangement of buildings on a lot and as they face the public environment the urban design objectives establish more general guidelines which along with the traffic impact indicators can assist property owners as they consider alternate uses for their property where a special permit is required from the planning board the urban design objectives and traffic impact indicators serve as considerations the merits of a proposal are judged to apply the building requirements and objectives effectively procedures are established by which public review of new construction can be undertaken the procedures provide an opportunity for the general public to review and comment on significant new development projects and where appropriate they allow the planning board special permit process to establish conditions by which new development can be shaped to serve city urban design objectives more effectively it is the intent of these procedures to provide a method by which new development proposals can be assessed at an early stage such assessment offers the opportunity to explore potential modifications and refinements that would better serve the interests of both the city and the project proponent similarly potential negative impacts can be identified and modifications explored that would reduce or eliminate them it is understood that nonprofit educational and religious uses and activities have special use building and site development requirements and characteristics therefore the procedures and standards established in this designed to reflect those special circumstances in reviewing any development proposal of a nonprofit educational or religious organization the reviewing body shall apply the standards herein contained 192 in a reasonable manner in light of the special circumstances applicable to nonprofit religious and educational activities this apply to any new construction of a building or structure addition to a building or structure or a change of use in an existing building undertaken on or after  1920 project review special permit 1921 purpose it is the intent of this to ensure that new construction or changes of use in existing buildings 1 are consistent with the urban design objectives of the city and 2 do not impose substantial adverse impacts on city traffic a special permit process is established by which the planning board may make such findings  purpose of traffic impact review the planning board shall assess the impact of the vehicular service and passenger car traffic and pedestrian and bicycle circulation and expected to be generated by a proposed development project the procedures and requirements of this are intended to encourage applicants to adopt a development program that reduces the number of single occupancy vehicles coming to the site such a program would encourage pedestrian and bicycle access to the site and throughout the neighboring district and reduce potential negative impacts on abutting properties of the vehicles coming to the site while the review will focus especially on the impacts affecting abutting properties and the immediate environment the impacts on streets and locations more distant from the site and on transit and bus facilities serving the site will also be assessed  purpose of urban design review the board shall review the specific design details of buildings and their site layout to ensure that the design of the building and its location on the lot minimize any potential negative impact on abutting properties and on the environment along public streets and sidewalks particular attention will be paid to the design of the ground floor  the layout of service facilities including driveways and parking and loading facilities  the location and screening of mechanical service equipment and waste disposal facilities  landscape amenities  and similar building and site layout details 1922 applicable zoning districts the project review special permit shall apply to construction and changes of use located in the following zoning districts 1 all

criteria in granting a special permit under this the planning board shall make the following findings  traffic impact findings where a traffic study is required as set forth in 3 above the planning board shall grant the special permit only if it finds that the project will have no substantial adverse impact on city traffic within the study area as analyzed in the traffic study substantial adverse impact on city traffic shall be measured by reference to the traffic impact indicators set forth in in areas where the planning board determines that areaspecific traffic guidelines have been established in the the board recognizes written agreements between project proponents and the city dealing with transportation mitigation strategies  traffic impact indicators in determining whether a proposal has substantial adverse impacts on city traffic the planning board shall apply the following indicators when one or more of the indicators is exceeded it will be indicative of potentially substantial adverse impact on city traffic in making its findings however the planning board shall consider the mitigation efforts proposed their anticipated effectiveness and other supplemental information that identifies circumstances or actions that will result in a reduction in adverse traffic impacts such efforts and actions may include but are not limited to transportation demand management plans  roadway bicycle and pedestrian facilities improvements  measures to reduce traffic on residential streets  and measures undertaken to improve safety for pedestrians and vehicles particularly at intersections identified in the traffic study as having a history of high crash rates the indicators are 1 project vehicle trip generation weekdays and weekends for a twentyfour hour period and a m and pm peak vehicle trips generated  2 change in level of service at identified signalized intersections  3 increased volume of trips on residential streets  4 increase of length of vehicle queues at identified signalized intersections  and 5 lack of sufficient pedestrian and bicycle facilities the precise numerical values that will be deemed to indicate potentially substantial adverse impact for each of these indicators shall be adopted from time to time by the planning board in consultation with the tptd published and made available to all applicants  urban design findings the planning board shall grant the special permit only if it finds that the project is consistent with the urban design objectives of the city as set forth in in making that determination the board may be guided by or make reference to urban design guidelines or planning reports that may have been developed for specific areas of the city and shall apply the standards herein contained in a reasonable manner to nonprofit religious and educational organizations in light of the special circumstances applicable to nonprofit religious and educational activities 1930 citywide urban design objectives 1910 the following urban design objectives are intended to provide guidance to property owners and the general public as to the citys policies with regard to the form and character desirable for new development in the city it is understood that application of these principles can vary with the context of specific building proposals in ways that nevertheless fully respect the policies intent it is intended that proponents of projects and city staff the planning board and the general public where public review or approval is required should be open to creative variations from the detailed provisions presented in this long as the core values expressed are being served a project need not meet all the objectives of this where this as the basis for issuance of a special permit rather the permit granting authority shall find that on balance the objectives of the city are being served nor shall a project subject to special permit review be required to conform to the required building and site plan requirements set forth in further indicators of conformance with these policy objectives shall be found in planning documents and plans developed for specific areas of the city or the city as a whole to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the objectives set forth in this these documents include the harvard square development guidelines the central square action plan the central square development guidelines the north massachusetts avenue urban design guidelines handbook the university park at mit urban design guidelines the north point policy plan and design guidelines the cambridge institutional growth management plan the east cambridge riverfront plan the eastern cambridge plan the eastern cambridge design guidelines the alewife revitalization alewife urban design study phase ii and its draft update of 199 and toward a sustainable future cambridge growth policy document 1931 new projects should be responsive to the existing or anticipated pattern of development indicators include 1 heights and setbacks provide suitable transition to abutting or nearby residential zoning districts that are generally developed to low scale residential uses 2 new buildings are designed and oriented on the lot so as to be consistent with the established streetscape on those streets on which the project lot abuts streetscape is meant to refer to the pattern of building setbacks and heights in relationship to public streets 3 in mixeduse projects uses are to be located carefully to respect the context eg retail should front onto a street new housing should relate to any adjacent existing residential use etc 4 where relevant historical context are respected eg special consideration should be given to buildings on the site or neighboring buildings that are preferably preserved 1932 development should be pedestrian and bicyclefriendly with a positive relationship to its surroundings indicators include 1 ground floors particularly where they face public streets public parks and publicly accessible pathways consist of spaces that are actively inhabited by 1911 people such as retail stores consumer service businesses and restaurants where they are allowed or general office educational or residential uses and building lobbies windows and doors that normally serve such inhabited spaces are encouraged to be a prominent aspect of the relevant building facades where a mix of activities are accommodated in a building the more active uses are encouraged facing public streets parks and pathways in commercial districts such active space consists of retail and consumer service stores and building lobbies that are oriented toward the street and encourage pedestrian activity on the sidewalk however in all cases such ground floor spaces should be occupied by uses a permitted in the zoning district within which the building is located b consistent with the general character of the environment within which the structure is located and c compatible with the principal use for which the building is designed 2 covered parking on the lower floors of a building and ongrade open parking particularly where located in front of a building is discouraged where a building faces a public street or public park and publicly accessible pathways 3 ground floors should be generally 2550% transparent the greatest amounts of glass would be expected for retail uses with lesser amounts for office institutional or residential use 4 entries to buildings are located so as to ensure safe pedestrian movement across streets encourage walking as a preferred mode of travel within the city and to encourage the use of public transit for employment and other trips relating building entries as directly as possible to crosswalks and to pathways that lead to bus stops and transit stations is encouraged  siting buildings on a lot and developing site plans that reinforce expected pedestrian pathways over the lot and district is also encouraged 5 pedestrians and bicyclists are able to access the site safely and conveniently  bicyclists should have secure storage facilities conveniently located onsite and out of the weather if bicycle parking is provided in a garage special attention must be aid to providing safe access to the facilities from the outside 6 alternate means of serving this policy objective 1932 building design siting or site design can be anticipated where the building form or use is distinctive such as freestanding parking structures large institutional buildings such as churches and auditoriums freestanding service buildings power plants athletic facilities manufacturing plants etc 1933 the building and site design should mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a development upon its neighbors indicators include 1912 1 mechanical equipment that is carefully designed well organized or visually screened from its surroundings and is acoustically buffered from neighbors consideration is given to the size complexity and appearance of the equipment its proximity to residential areas and its impact on the existing streetscape and skyline the extent to which screening can bring order lessen negative visual impacts and enhance the overall appearance of the equipment should be taken into account more specifically a reasonable attempts have been made to avoid exposing rooftop mechanical equipment to public view from city streets among the techniques that might be considered are the inclusion of screens or a parapet around the roof of the building to shield low ducts and other equipment on the roof from view b treatment of the mechanical equipment including design and massing of screening devices as well as exposed mechanical elements that relates well to the overall design massing scale and character of the building c placement of mechanical equipment at locations on the site other than on the rooftop such as in the basement which reduces the bulk of elements located on the roof  however atgrade locations external to the building should not be viewed as desirable alternatives d tall elements such as chimneys and air exhaust stacks which are typically carried above screening devices for functioning reasons are carefully designed as features of the building thus creating interest on the skyline e all aspects of the mechanical equipment have been designed with attention to their visual impact on adjacent areas particularly with regard to residential neighborhoods and views and vistas 2 trash that is handled to avoid impacts noise odor and visual quality on neighbors eg the use of trash compactors or containment of all trash storage and handling within a building is encouraged 3 loading docks that are located and designed to minimize impacts visual and operational on neighbors 4 stormwater best management practices and other measures to minimize runoff and improve water quality are implemented 5 landscaped areas and required green area open space in addition to serving as visual amenities are employed to reduce the rate and volume of stormwater runoff compared to predevelopment conditions 6 the structure is designed and sited to minimize shadow impacts on neighboring lots especially shadows that would have a significant impact on the use and enjoyment of adjacent open space and shadows that might impact the 1913 operation of a registered solar energy system as defined in of this zoning 7 changes in grade across the lot are designed in ways that minimize the need for structural retaining walls close to property lines 8 building scale and wall treatment including the provision of windows are sensitive to existing residential uses on adjacent lots 9 outdoor lighting is designed to provide minimum lighting and necessary to ensure adequate safety night vision and comfort while minimizing light pollution 10 the creation of a tree protection plan that identifies important trees on the site encourages their protection or provides for adequate replacement of trees lost to development on the site 1934 projects should not overburden the city infrastructure services including neighborhood roads city water supply system and sewer

residential construction are permitted and 3 future residential construction on suitable sites is not inhibited the overlay district is intended to facilitate a mixed use environment supportive of housing construction within the district in the future while permitting existing non residential activities to operate and adjust to changing circumstances expansion in built area in ways that will not negatively impact residential activities 2022 permitted nonresidential uses and new construction a use not otherwise permitted in the base residential district may be permitted in the mixed use residential overlay district where such use is allowed or conditionally allowed in the industry a1 district subject to the following conditions and limitations and the procedures established in below

planning board shall take into consideration the following and make appropriate findings related thereto 1 the proposed new use or expansion of an existing use will contribute to a physical and use environment that is supportive of residential uses as for example the introduction of ancillary retail and consumer services  2 in its operations scale building design and location on the lot the proposed use or new constriction will not significantly impair the health safety and welfare of current residential occupants of the district or impair the prospects for construction of new residential uses on adjacent lots or within the district or alternately will positively contribute to the health safety and welfare of residents in the district  3 in its design the new construction could be reasonably converted to residential use in the future  4 where it is proposed to construct a building on a vacant lot or where it is proposed to expand an existing facility not used for residential purposes by more than fifteen 15 percent of its existing gross floor area the lot is not suitable for residential use as indicated by its location and surrounding uses where the lot may be suitable for residential use the proposed construction is to serve an existing operation or enterprise now in the district that operation or enterprise shall be found to be an important contributor to

regulations and procedures specified in this purpose of this to allow for the creation of studio 2085 or onebedroom apartment units in appropriate unused basement level space of certain existing multifamily residential buildings that have one or more existing basement level apartment units given the increasing expense of unsubsidized rental housing in cambridge the shortage of reasonably priced affordable studio and one bedroom units and the difficulty this poses for local workers students and the elderly it is in the public interest to permit the creation of additional units under circumstances which promote the maintenance and improvement of older buildings including improved stormwater and wastewater management and which provide additional housing without building new structures or increasing the size of existing structures the corridor along massachusetts avenue between harvard square and porter square contains a significant number of buildings wholly or partially on lots with a base district among the residence c family of use categories res c c1 c1a c2 c2a c2b c3 c3a c3b which because of their age location current existence of one or more basement units and proximity to public transit options present an ideal set of circumstances for the city to encourage the creation of basement units and thereby explore the desirability and viability of possible expansion of similar development elsewhere in the city  applicability the regulations of this apply within the basement housing overlay district to existing structures designed and built for residential use which also meet all of the following standards a the structure is located wholly or partially within a residence c c1 c1a c2a c2 c2a c2b c3 c3a or c3b base zoning district  b the structure is currently occupied by at least thirty 30 dwelling units  c the structure was built before 1930 and its footprint or foundation has not been expanded or altered after the effective date of this as may be required and approved as a condition to the grant of a special permit hereunder  d the structure currently contains at least one dwelling unit located entirely at the basement level portions of those structures that meet the applicability requirements set forth above that are not located within a residence c family zoning district would be treated for all dimensional and use requirements as if wholly located within a residence c family zoning district  standards where it is proposed to create additional dwelling units by converting existing gross floor area which is not presently occupied by dwelling units into dwelling units at the basement level of the existing structure the dimensional and parking standards generally applicable in any base zoning district shall apply however where some or all of those requirements cannot be met the planning board may waive some or all of the dimensional and parking standards generally applicable in the base district upon issuance of a special permit subject to the following limitations a where the floor area ratio of the existing structure exceeds the maximum floor area ratio allowed in the base zoning district the gross floor area of the existing structure shall not be increased b where the existing structure or lot does not conform to the height yard or private open space requirements generally applicable in

registering such systems so that nearby developers can be aware of their existence and to provide limited zoning protections for such systems in some instances where developers of neighboring properties are seeking a special permit or variance  solar energy systems are viewed as potentially valuable contributors to meeting the citys objective of encouraging sustainable development and energy conservation however the complex nature of urban development in the city limits the extent to which the citys zoning regulations can be employed to guarantee longterm access to sunlight on a wide geographic basis therefore the following provisions are intended to provide limited support for such systems and to raise awareness of their contribution to the objectives of this the part of the general public and property owners 2262 a solar energy system shall be defined as a device or combination of equipment that converts radiant energy from the sun into heat or electricity that can be

department and made available to property owners by request 2264 protection of registered solar energy systems the impacts of a proposed development seeking a special permit or variance on a registered solar energy system shall be considered by the board of zoning appeal or the planning board whichever is applicable in making its determination as described in of this zoning protection shall be provided by this zoning a solar energy system that does not meet the definition of a registered solar energy system 2270 wind turbine systems 2271 purpose it is the intent of this to permit the limited use of wind turbines throughout the city a for the purpose of small scale generation of electricity for onsite consumption as an accessory use to other activities located on the same lot b for the purpose of researching testing evaluating or demonstration of the efficacy in an urban setting of such instruments as a means by which renewable sources of energy might be employed to generate electricity at a larger scale for both a domestic and commercial purposes and c in appropriate locations in non residential districts for the generation of electricity for commercial sale as a principal use these provisions are intended to ensure that such facilities are well designed carefully sited and operated in a manner that will not pose a nuisance or hazard to the general public or nearby neighbors 2272 wind turbine systems permitted by special permit a wind turbine system may generally be permitted anywhere in the city after the granting of a special permit from the planning board subject to the conditions and limitations described in this in special cases there is a limited provision for the permitting of wind turbine systems asofright without the granting of a special permit as described in below  dimensional limitations 1 height there shall be no maximum height limit for a wind turbine but the permitted height of a wind turbine shall be specifically approved by the planning board 2 setbacks there shall be no required minimum yard setbacks for a wind turbine but the permitted placement of a wind turbine with respect to public street lines and adjacent lot lines shall be specifically approved by the planning board all equipment and structures accessory to the wind turbine shall be subject to the yard requirements of the applicable zoning district unless waived by the planning board  application material at a minimum the special permit application shall contain the following material 1 plans of the site showing the location of the wind turbine system and its relationship to other uses and buildings on the site including elevations of wind turbines and other features on the site  plans descriptions illustrations andor photographs describing the

any proposed screening and landscaping 2 a detailed description of the wind turbine system including number size materials noise rating operational plan maintenance schedule 3 a narrative discussion of the extent to which the operation of the proposed wind turbine system will generate continuous shadows intermittent shadows aka flicker andor noise that may be detected from adjacent properties and from the public street 4 photo simulations or other representations from at least two vantage points one of which should be from a public street illustrating the proposal in its physical context 5 a detailed estimate of the cost of removal of the wind turbine system  standards for granting of the special permit in addition to the limitations requirements described in below and the criteria established in of the zoning the granting of a special permit the planning board shall consider the following specific criteria 1 the visual impact of the wind turbine system on the abutting properties and the neighborhood in recognition of the fact that a wind turbine of any significant size will introduce a physical structure and form not typical of most residential and commercial neighborhoods in the city the planning board shall consider the following when assessing whether a proposal has any unreasonable negative impacts on neighborhood character or adjacent uses a the size scale and bulk of the proposed wind turbine system in relationship to the scale of typical buildings and other elements in the neighborhood  b the visibility and impact of the proposed wind turbine system from important view corridors and viewsheds with the understanding that reasonable efforts should be made to make the system visually unobtrusive although in many cases a system may not be reasonably expected to be screened from public view  c the nature of adjacent uses including the historical and architectural quality of surrounding buildings the consistency of that architectural character over an extended area and the extent to which the proposed wind turbine system is visually integrated with that character and with the larger urban landscape  and d in the case of buildingmounted wind turbine systems the visual relationship between the system and the architecture of the building upon which it is installed 2 the extent frequency and duration of continuous and intermittent shadows and their relationship to interior spaces and places people will regularly occupy such impacts should be minimized and directed away from sensitive spaces in residential environments it shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that there shall be no significant adverse impact on adjacent properties 3 the extent of detectable noise and vibration impact on neighboring uses 4 where a wind turbine system is proposed in an open space district or near an open space facility particularly one with a significant natural aspect the systems impact on any conservation historic or recreational value should be carefully analyzed 5 other factors with regard to the operational and visual impacts of the wind turbine system that may suggest that a time limitation should be imposed on the special permit 2273 wind turbine systems permitted asofright a wind turbine system shall be permitted asofright without the granting of a special permit only if the conditions and limitations of this the requirements of below are met any proposed wind turbine system not meeting all of the conditions and limitations of this may be permitted only after the granting
