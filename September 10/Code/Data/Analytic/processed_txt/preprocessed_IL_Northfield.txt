example one may receive a variation from a 10 foot setback requirement but one may not receive a variation to operate a gasoline service station in a residential zoning district there are two 2 types of variations in the village a a class i variation provides for relief when more than a ten percent 10% variance from a standard of appendix a of this code is requested a class i variation is applicable when the applicant is able to use his or her property in a manner permitted by appendix a of this code but not as intensely as desired by the applicant b a class ii variation is a variation in which the owner claims that he or she cannot use the property at all for any use permitted in the zoning district unless the variation is granted 3 requirements for application an application for any variation or mra may be filed with the community development and building department by the legal or equitable owner or a contract purchaser of the subject property an application for a variation

facilities and services such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the motion to grant the variation or mra violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of appendix a of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variation or mra by the zoning board of appeals 7 occupancy certificates any structure for which a variation or an mra has been granted shall comply with all conditions imposed on the grant of variation or mra before a final occupancy certificate may be issued 8 fee schedule the application fees and escrow amounts for variations and

complete the structure for which a building permit was issued in the time specified in this code for building permits the variation or mra shall lapse and be of no further force or effect 10 matters to be considered in deciding whether or not to grant an mra or a variation the applicant must provide actual evidence on each of the following issues as it pertains to the applicants request and the village manager or the zoning board of appeals shall consider the following a with respect to an mra class i and class ii variation 1 to what extent is the applicant responsible for the condition that is the subject of the request a was the regulation from which relief is sought in existence when the applicant either purchased or improved the property b has the applicant changed the property in some way so as to create the problem condition c might the applicant have taken some action in the past to prevent or avoid the problem which is the subject of the request 2 will the relief requested adversely affect public health safety or welfare 3 is there a reasonable alternative which is consistent with the zoning ordinance if there is such an alternative but the applicant believes the additional cost is prohibitive then it is the applicants burden to set forth the cost of each alternative 4 will the relief requested exceed the minimum necessary to accomplish the applicants stated purpose 5 will the relief requested be out of character with the neighborhood 6 are there other structures within the same zoning district in the village which either violate or have received a variation from the same regulation b with respect to class i variations only 1 will the variation have a negative effect on the value of neighboring properties 2 in cases where the applicant is claiming that the cost of compliance with the zoning ordinance is extraordinary what is the ratio of the following cost differential to the value of the entire property the differential between a the cost of constructing the improvement in compliance with the zoning ordinance  and b the cost of constructing the improvement with the variation cost of construction without variation minus cost of construction with variation current market value of entire property  sterling codifiers inc  44377 the higher the cost differential in relation to the value of the property the more positive weight that should be given to this consideration 3 can the property in question yield a reasonable return without the variation if used only under the conditions allowed by code a variation may not be granted based solely upon a desire to extract additional income from the property where a reasonable return is possible without the variation this standard where applicable contemplates a practical difficulty which does not rest upon the particular personal financial situation of the applicant and is applicable only to nonresidential or multifamily rental property c class ii variations only 1 if the strict terms of the zoning ordinance are applied may any reasonable improvement be erected or continue to be used that is intended for a use permitted in the zoning district 2 does the negative impact on the applicant in not being able to use the property in the specific manner requested substantially outweigh any negative impact on adjacent properties if the variation is granted 3 is the relief requested the minimum necessary to use the property in a manner reasonably similar to other uses in the neighborhood 11 procedures when an mra is requested an application for an mra shall be

preserve the character of the residential and commercial areas of the village is perhaps the most essential function performed by the village 3 the village is predominately a singlefamily residential community with ninety one percent 91% of the total land area of the village zoned and used for residential school park library and governmental purposes 4 the regulation of adult uses serves a substantial governmental interest while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of communication 5 the supreme court of the state of illinois has judicially confirmed that the regulation of adult uses serves a valid governmental interest 6 the proposed regulations are not aimed at the content of adult entertainment but at the secondary effects associated with it including but not limited to a a negative impact on the real estate market where adult entertainment is offered  b urban blight as a result of the decrease in property values  and c an increase in the need for police patrols and services 7 sexually oriented businesses in the incorporated area of the village of northfield require special supervision from public safety and health agencies in order to protect and preserve the

sexually oriented businesses in other cities including but not limited to the attorney general of minnesotas report of 1989 which summarized the following studies indianapolis indiana 1984  village of los angeles california 1984  phoenix arizona 1979  and st paul minnesota 1978 9 from review of other cities studies and their own surveys and testimony from its citizens there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing among other adverse secondary effects increased crime and downgrading of property values 10 it is recognized that sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are operating in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to crime lower property values urban blight and downgrading of the quality of

harmful materials possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 13 concern over

sexually oriented business uses  b areas where children could be expected to walk patronize or frequent should be free of sexually oriented business use  c sexually oriented business uses should be

on property values and business would cause the loss to some commercial districts within the village leading to deterioration of the commercial quality of the  sterling codifiers inc  177377 village  and g no evidence has been presented to show that location of sexually oriented businesses within the village will improve the commercial viability or qualify of life of the community 15 zoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to ensure the operator of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places which minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation 16 the village recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the avoidance of such businesses which necessitate children walking visiting in the immediate neighborhood of such businesses 17
