1222008 by   5122009 by   30023 scope and purpose a policy statement 1 it is hereby determined that the waterways within the city of long branch are at times subjected to flooding that such flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public  that such flooding is also a danger to the natural resources of the city of long branch the county and the state  that development tends to accentuate flooding by increasing stormwater runoff due to alteration of the hydrologic response of the watershed in changing from the undeveloped to the developed condition  that such increased flooding produced by the development of real property contributes increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and tends to increase channel erosion  that such increased flooding increased erosion and increased pollution constitutes deterioration of the water resources of the city of long branch the county and the state  and that such increased flooding increased erosion and increased pollution can be controlled to some extent by the regulation of stormwater runoff from such development 2 it is therefore determined that it is in the public interest to regulate the development of real property and to establish standards to regulate the additional discharge of stormwater runoff from such developments as provided in this chapter flood control groundwater recharge and pollutant reduction or lowimpact techniques shall be explored before relying on structural best management practices bmps structural bmps should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed

345124 findings and purpose a in adopting this article it is the intention of the city council of the city of long branch to designate and regulate historic sites within the city consistent with and pursuant to the municipal land use law of the state of new jersey njsa d1 et seq and as interpreted by court decisions in this state b a commission is hereby created to review the potential effect of development and permit applications on designated historic sites and to work with and advise the planning board and zoning board and individual property owners on the effect of applications coming before either board on designated historic properties or improvements within an historic district c this article is intended to regulate only those activities on designated sites which require a permit from a municipal officer or employee or which require an application for development to the planning board or zoning board nothing herein shall prevent review of other activities by the commission but such review is not required by the adoption of this article d this article does not require or prohibit any particular architectural style  rather its purpose is to preserve the past by making the past compatible with and relevant to the present to that end new construction upon or near an historic site should not necessarily duplicate the exact style of the site  rather it should be compatible with and not detract from the historic site e this article does not require or mandate the creation of any historic districts a the city council of the city of long branch finds and determines that the city has many historic and architecturally significant properties together with groupings of properties of generally vernacular structures these properties contribute visually to the character and integrity of the city and are important in assessing the historic patterns 235 editors note these historic preservation provisions were added as  3451 were subsequently renumbered 9222009 by  vehicles storage of  345124  of development and the citys history maintaining preserving and rehabilitating these visual links to the past is an important function of government not only to provide a sense of stability and continuity for future generations but to provide impetus for the revitalization of the citys economic base and for the resulting increase in property values b moreover the citys master plan adopted by the city council in 1988 contained many elements related to historic preservation designations including a list of more than 60 properties which were identified as qualifying for landmark status c these historic preservation regulations are intended to effect and accomplish the protection enhancement and perpetuation of especially noteworthy examples of the citys environment in order to 1 safeguard the heritage of long branch by preserving resources within the city which reflect elements of its cultural social economic and architectural history  2 encourage the continued use of historic landmarks and facilitate their appropriate use  3 maintain and develop an appropriate and harmonious setting for the historic and architecturally
