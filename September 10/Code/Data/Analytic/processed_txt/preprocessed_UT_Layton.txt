the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts   print preview  7593 n sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of

persons view adult oriented films  p the findings noted in paragraphs a o raise substantial governmental concerns  q sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  r a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a

operator of the sexually oriented business falls in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  s prohibiting doors or similar partitions on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres  t requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  u the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in
