and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for cass county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in subsection b1 of

applicants should use the recommended site analysis required site plan criteria see city of pleasant hill zoning  as a basis in developing a conceptual plan the site analysis and conceptual plans are extremely useful in preapplication meetings probably the most important step in the development process is obtaining correct and clear information in the initial stages of design as such applicants are required to meet with staff and the planning commission prior to application submittal this affords the applicant an ability to discuss initial concept plans necessary approvals and design and development criteria prior to submitting an application table a1 residential lot area and density regulations outlines the minimum lot area size allowed in the citys various zoning districts as well as the maximum density allowed for multifamily dwellings in the r3 district reductions in the minimum lot sizes or increases in the development density can be granted with approval of a pd planned

targeted development percentage indicates the communitys desired mix of residential density within the entire city each development should strive to provide a mix residential uses that help the community achieve this mix conceptual plans the site analysis and discussions with staff and the planning commission should then be used to generate site plans site plan application may then be submitted according to the approved application submittal and review schedule of the planning commission available at the office of the city clerk in pleasant hill city hall each development proposal should be evaluated by the evaluation forms in this appendix and bonus density awarded on that basis   earning density bonuses incentives each residential development whether singlefamily twofamily or multifamily entails different site characteristics impacts and opportunities it is the responsibility of the planner architect and developer to provide the highest quality neighborhood environment however the city recognizes that developing highquality residential uses comes at an added cost in order to help offset these added costs and encourage highquality residential development this document provides for density bonuses use of design incentives this is a mechanism to recognize unique and innovative developments and reward good design this approach acknowledges the value and potential costs of incorporating certain design elements within a neighborhood and is subject to caps as expressed in minimum lot sizes within each residential zoning district a range of densities dwelling units per acre are permitted by meeting the minimum requirements of the residential district the lowest project density for that district is achieved by meeting the minimum requirements of the district and applicable design objectives listed on the following pages project densities may reach the upper end of the density range for example in the r1 zoning district singlefamily development which meets only the minimum requirements of the district should be rewarded only with a maximum density of one to threeunits per acre singlefamily development that meets the intent of the design objectives listed herein should be allowed to reach a maximum density of five units per acre see table a1 residential lot area and density regulations unitsperacre are expressed as gross density which includes rightsofway and easements for streets and utilities whichas a rule of thumbcomprise between 25 percent and 30 percent of the land in a typical subdivision gross density does not include common areas dedicated to public or private use such as areas or reserves for storm detention and recreation if higher densities are desired they may be achieved successful incorporation of the design incentives and bonuses listed herein to earn design incentives the applicant must apply for each specific incentive as part of the site plan or planned development application in doing so the applicant must supply the necessary information to represent the requested design incentives once received the planning commission will review each incentive and will approve or deny the requested incentive when considering each of the incentives it should be clear that bonuses are not a right the use of the design requirements design objectives and design incentives outlined within this document do not insure that applications will receive the maximum density permitted rather permitted density and density bonuses will also be greatly influenced by considerations such as compliance with the future land use projections land use compatibility zoning patterns environmental impacts traffic impacts and other relevant considerations as a result the planning commission may require proposed densities to be reduced as part of their deliberations during the site plan review process this may occur even if the application has implemented some or all of the standards set forth in this document the amount of density bonus awarded for the successful incorporation of a design incentive is entirely at the citys discretion based on consideration of the developments compliance with these regulations the comprehensive plan land use compatibility zoning patterns environmental impacts and traffic impacts it is the intent of the guidelines to require the maximum possible density be achieved application of bonus incentives from more than one category of the guidelines   design objectives and density standardsincentives the following density and design standards and incentives articulate design principles common to strong neighborhoods these criteria should be applied throughout the design process and will be applied in review of all residential projects design standards and incentives are organized into design objectives and density incentives design requirements represent minimum standards and are codified into other sections of the zoning regulations design objectives listed herein reflect community design expectations and are policies to be followed in project review density incentives listed herein are design strategies that may be incorporated to achieve higher unit densities   transitions between largelot and urban subdivisions the planning and design of areas adjacent to largelot residential developments is important in providing an orderly and appropriate transition to higher density developments and differing lot sizes transitional development designs should achieve a character and appearance comparable to the largelot subdivision extra sensitivity must be used when locating a subdivision with urban densities adjacent to existing platted largelot residential subdivisions new developments should provide an orderly and appropriate visual and physical transition between the developments with different densities urban residential lots adjacent to largelot developments should be similar in size with a gradual reduction in lot sizes as the distance from the largelot development increases the developments should be designed to create a seamless visual transition a strong visual divider between the two types of development is highly discouraged new lots in the first tier adjacent to an existing platted largelot subdivision should be similar in total area and have a comparable width at the building line the area differential should be no greater than onequarter 14 but may not be required to exceed a lot area of more than one 1 acre the width and depth of lots adjacent to existing platted large lots significantly greater than an average of one 1 acre will be reviewed with appropriate standards determined on an individual basis as lots transition beyond the first tier adjacent to a largelot subdivision the area differential of lots in the second tier should be no less than fifty 50 percent of the typical lot area in the adjacent largelot subdivision the width of the lot at the building line should continue to remain comparable in appearance the second tier may transition to smaller lot sizes at higher densities as typically found in conventional urban subdivisions existing natural features tree areas andor hedgerows should be preserved and incorporated as buffers whenever possible utility easements must not be placed within the drip area of trees to be preserved planned zoning districts should be used in all areas adjacent to largelot subdivisions   singlefamily residential density standards the zoning ordinance references the comprehensive plan as a guide for future zoning decisions the land use categories of the future land use map are defined in table 62 of the plan and are replicated in table a1 to indicate zoning bonus density available to be awarded developments that meet the intent of the residential density standards and design guidelines the bonus densities would be allowed based on site plan review approval by the city given amenities provided by the developer to meet good urban design to accommodate neighborhood infill  natural features  open space  building orientation  pedestrian circulation  landscaping  grading  architectural design  and appropriate transitions between neighborhoods   neighborhood infill existing residential neighborhoods in pleasant hill have strong patterns of form activity and character infill development should strive to strengthen these characteristics and enhance the positive elements of neighborhoods for the purpose of these standards infill residential projects shall be any development proposed within an existing established residential area a design objectives 1 the physical form and pattern of existing established residential neighborhoods should be maintained to the greatest extent possible infill design should incorporate the following principles a building orientation should reflect the predominant neighborhood pattern the fronttofront backtoback relationship of typical residential neighborhoods establishes security privacy and a very identifiable streetscape that should be maintained b vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns should be maintained by infill projects c neighborhood open space patterns and side front and rear yards should be visually preserved the spacing of infill units front rear and side yards should generally reflect the spacing of existing homes in the neighborhood d building heights should be compatible with the average height of homes in the neighborhood each project should be particularly sensitive to planning and design of contiguous parcels e the streetscape and landscaping should be designed to reflect existing neighborhood forms rhythm and spacing 2 the visual character of a neighborhood is in part formed architecture and various activities such as parking infill development should a provide parking and garages in a matter and scale similar to the surrounding neighborhood parking should be screened from view to minimize its negative visual impact infill development should maintain consistent placement and orientation of garages as those within the neighborhood b the architectural design of infill development should strengthen the existing forms of the neighborhood architecturally project design should represent compatible building form  roof types slope and overhand  horizontal and vertical proportions  exterior materials finishes and details c the style and image of the neighborhood should be reinforced by infill development where style and image may be lacking infill design has more latitude and should strive to achieve a stronger neighborhood image   natural features a design objectives 1 the following elements should be used to strengthen the neighborhood recreation areas internal and external focal points and provide physical separations and buffers natural site features should be used to create neighborhood amenities and may include a floodplains and surface drainage channels  b bodies of water  c prominent ridges bluffs or valleys  and d existing vegetation  e implement stream buffer standards as presented in the comprehensive plan 2 every reasonable effort should be made to preserve existing tree cover including tree masses wind rows and significant individual trees these features should be incorporated as neighborhood amenities 3 in most cases excessive cut and fill and similar changes to the sites natural topography are not acceptable site planning and building orientation should work with natural slopes and grades to create individual neighborhoods b design incentives 1 upon the recommendation of the planning commission a two percent 2% increase in density may be approved if existing significant natural features in unimproved common area are preserved and stream buffer standards are met if applicable unimproved common area does not include private patios narrow strips of land around and between units areas reserved for the exclusive use of an individual tenant and setbacks at site perimeters   open space a design objectives 1 sufficient neighborhood open space should be provided to meet active and passive use requirements of the neighborhood a open space is any parcel or area of land or water set aside dedicated designated or reserved for public or private use or enjoyment or for the use and enjoyment of owners and occupants of land adjoining or neighboring such open space open space may include common active and landscaped areas as well as areas of passivenatural preservation unpaved land areas within private or public street rightsofway are not considered as open space unless such areas are in excess of minimum rightofway standards b common areas should be centrally located within and highly accessible to the neighborhood such areas should be of adequate size and designed to reduce impacts of various functions and activities common areas may include pools and larger recreational paths c active or landscaped open space is that part of the net site area of a development that may be improved or set aside dedicated designated or reserved for recreational use such as swimming pools play equipment ball fields picnic tables sports courts etc such open space may also include turflawn areas shrubs and trees walkways paved terraces sitting areas and outdoor recreational areas d passive or natural open space is essentially unimproved land or water area not individually owned that is part of the net site area of a development and is designed and intended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of a development such open space may include natural features which are physical characteristics of properties that are not manmade eg soil types geology slopes vegetation surface water drainage patterns aquifers recharge areas climate floodplains aquatic life and wildlife 2 in some instances it may be appropriate to use open space common and semicommon areas to buffer negative impacts 3 where possible open space should be designed to provide linkages with larger community open space systems 4 pedestrian access to open space should be provided using sidewalks or recreation trails that link sidewalks along area streets with the open space areas 5 every attempt should be made to minimize the amount of unusable and unassigned open space b density incentives 1 upon the recommendation of the planning commission a four percent 4% density increase may be allowed for developments that provide outstanding open space which may include one of the following a the dedication of acceptable public park land which significantly exceeds the citys minimum land area dedication requirements b a minimum of fifty 50 percent of the open space area is improved as active open space for recreational use by all persons who reside in the subdivision such area does not include common areas for storm detention or retention   pedestrian and vehicular circulation a design objectives 1 pedestrian access should be designed to provide reasonable linkages of dwelling units to neighborhood facilities such as parks and open space recreation services mail and neighborhood retail services 2 pedestrian systems should incorporate landscaping details to increase the visual interest and character of the neighborhood 3 the design of pedestrian facilities should respond to their intended use and meet the following design standards a sidewalks along streets and drives shall be a minimum five 5 feet in width b recreational and bike paths shall be a minimum ten 10 feet in width 4 the design of streets should respond to topography intended traffic speed and views the following points apply a streets should not fight the topography or ignore local conditions for purposes of maximizing the number of units in a development align the street with local conditions such as topography watercourses greenways and existing street systems of neighboring developments b excessively straight and wide streets encourage high speed traffic and do not have a residential scale streets should be laid out such that their use by will be discouraged however the street network must consist of interconnecting streets with alternative routes neighborhood to diffuse automobile traffic and shorten walking distances c as streets serve as primary open space the views along and within streets are important views along residential streets should be clearly defined street trees building orientation and street layout should create a residential scale and character b density incentives 1 upon the recommendation of the planning commission a four percent 4% density increase may be allowed for neighborhood circulation systems which provide outstanding design and which may include a pedestrian paths within the development and to the development edge that link with amenities open spaces parks and other destinations b pedestrian path linkages to regional walking path improvements   landscaping landscaping should be designed in sufficient form quantity and location to reduce to the greatest extent possible negative impacts affecting the site and adjacent properties and to increase the sense of neighborhood scale character and identity a design objectives 1 landscaping is an important element of the site plan a diversity of plant materials including overstory and understory trees deciduous and coniferous shrubbery ground cover and turf should be used a successful landscaping plan should include a overstory and understory trees which can be used to provide enclosure tree canopy larger trees can reduce the perceived scale of larger structures b understory trees and shrubbery provide eyelevel vegetation typically these materials should be used as foundation plantings which tie the structure to the ground and soften hard edges create visual focal points to frame desirable views and provide privacy screens 2 landscaping should define the neighborhood by providing a scale and enclosure of open space streets parks and recreation areas b visual separation and screening of interior and exterior private areas c gateways and defined entries to the neighborhood d a minimum of two 2 trees for every singlefamily lot the trees shall be no less than two 2inch caliper deciduous shade trees as measured six inches 6 above the ground and conifers six to eight feet in height  as specified by the american association of nurserymen e attractive streets by the use of street trees such trees when placed along a street provide shade for streets and sidewalks improve aesthetics and generally encourage pedestrian use of sidewalks street trees also maintain a ceiling or canopy that further imbues a pedestrian scale to the streetscape f well landscaped perimeters of the development installation of a master landscape buffer plan welllandscaped areas along a neighborhoods perimeter have a tremendous impact on the perception and impression of residents experience in their daily lives 3 environmental and site impacts should be minimized by a buffering adjacent higher and lower intensity uses such as commercial and singlefamily residential b addressing regional and microclimatic factors which include reducing radiant heat and heat gain providing solar access and wind protection c reducing perceived density view corridors providing visual focal points and softening and enhancing pedestrian paths and open areas 4 berms and walls or a combination thereof can be used with landscaping to increase neighborhood privacy security and to reduce negative impacts along adjacent major roadways and adjacent properties walls should be designed to be compatible with neighborhood materials and forms b density incentives upon the recommendation of the planning commission a maximum five percent 5% density increase may be permitted for site landscaping in addition to the required minimum landscaping standards set forth in the city of pleasant hill zoning installation of street trees in addition to the required number of trees per singlefamily lot street trees shall be placed a maximum average of forty 40feet oncenter along the street the trees shall be no less than 212inch caliper deciduous shade trees as measured six 6inches above the ground and conifers six to eight 68 feet in height  as specified by the american association of nurserymen b installation of a master landscapebuffer plan around the perimeter of the development adjacent to major roadways perimeter landscapes shall include a mixture of shade coniferousevergreen and ornamental trees to provide a variety of foliage shade and seasonal interest earth berms and shrubbery should be used to accentuate the landscape improvements   grading a design objectives 1 berms channels swales etc should be designed and graded to be an integral part of the landscape 2 the maximum slope of any grade should not exceed three feet in the horizontal to one foot in the vertical 31 grade changes in excess of 31 should be made by natural or constructed retaining walls 3 where retaining walls are required they should be of a material compatible with the primary building architecture the extensive use of railroad ties and gabion type retaining walls should be avoided 4 grading should occur in a manner to preserve existing trees vegetation and natural topographic features as much as possible   architectural design the architecture of residential development is a key element in determining the character and function of a neighborhood the character of a neighborhood should create a strong feeling of identity the function of housing should meet the needs of the occupants and be specifically tuned to regional and site features building designs that create variety and do not look monotonous if replicated throughout the development are required such designs should include the following 1 side and rear building elevations garages carports and all accessory structures with the same level of design aesthetic quality and architectural detailing 2 porches varied rooflines and varied facade depths to create variety and individuality of each dwelling within the building 3 windows and projecting wall surfaces to break up larger wall surfaces and establish visual interest and to provide visibility of the street and other public spaces to encourage social interaction 4 garages designed to be integrated with the building design rather than projecting in front of the habitable living space so as to avoid monotonous rows of garage doors garages shall be oriented so that they do not visually dominate the building facade or the streetscape 5 40 year laminated composition shingles or equivalent a design objectives 1 the architectural design of each unit or building should be designed to a residential neighborhood scale specifically architecture should respond to perceived density building mess and details a a strong sense of neighborhood should be created by reducing the perceived density of a project b use porches railings fascia boards and trim to enhance buildings character c locate and orient garages so they are deemphasized and do not visually dominate the building facade or the streetscape alternative garage orientations may include access from the side or rear of the structure or setback a minimum two 2feet from the front wall of the habitable living space for frontoriented garages d decorative durable building materials on the front facade and all other facades visible from the street e a useable covered front entry porch with a minimum depth of seven 7 feet and a minimum area of seventy 70 square feet f heavy textured dimensional roofing material g the sense of scale is another factor in establishing a strong sense of neighborhood architecturally the massing of individual building should reinforce a neighborhood scale providing vertical and horizontal offsets in units this serves to break up rooflines define private outdoor areas allow greater views light and air to unit interiors b density incentives upon the recommendation of the planning commission a five percent 5% density increase may be allowed for enhanced architectural design for homes within the development that meets the stated objectives of these regulations or by including other architectural design elements determined by the commission to represent enhanced design quality above and beyond the quality that is otherwise found in a typical pleasant hill singlefamily residential subdivision   neighborhood

parking should be located within 200 feet of the respective dwelling units the overall layout and configuration of parking areas should be designed to control excessive amounts of paved area the following points apply a doubleloaded parking areas along private streets or drives are generally not acceptable every attempt should be made to cluster and separate parking areas from the street landscaping changes in grade etc should be used to break up these spaces b clustered parking spaces should not exceed 100 spaces in total any area consisting of two doubleloaded parking aisles should have a landscaped area separating each aisle perimeter areas should be substantially screened from view see landscaping 4 the location and design of covered parking dramatically affects the character of the site it is important to plan for the covered parking requirements at an early stage to avoid structures that detract from the neighborhood image a the location and grouping of parking enclosures should compliment the primary building arrangement and design in clustered parking areas carports should be used to provide enclosure the larger the parking area the greater the need to break it up with carports and landscaping b carports can also be used to reduce negative offsite impacts such as noise in this manner carports can form a visual enclosure which increases the security of the neighborhood c on sloping sites carports can be integrated into the site this can be used to accommodate changes in grade minimize the visual appearance of the carport and buffer negative impacts d the materials and structural members of the carport should be of a dimension that ties the structure to the ground some carports appear spindly due to the proportion of the materials to the

permitted for site landscaping in addition to the required minimum landscaping standards set forth in the city of pleasant hill zoning 1 installation of street trees in addition to the required number of trees per dwelling unit street trees shall be placed a maximum average of forty 40feet oncenter along the street or private drive the trees shall be no less than 212inch caliper deciduous shade trees as measured six 6inches above the ground and conifers six to eight 68 feet in height  as specified by the american association of nurserymen 2 installation of a master landscapebuffer plan

and seasonal interest earth berms and shrubbery should be used to accentuate the landscape improvements   grading a design objectives 1 berms channels swales etc should be designed and graded to be an integral part of the landscape 2 the maximum slope of any grade should not exceed three feet in the horizontal to one foot in the vertical 31 grade changes in excess of 31 should be made by natural or constructed retaining walls 3 where retaining walls are required they should be of a material compatible with the primary building architecture the extensive use of railroad ties and gabion type retaining walls should be avoided 4 buildings should be located above adjacent street and parking areas the average grade adjacent to a structure should slope away from the structure for a minimum of ten feet 10 at a five percent 5% slope 5 grading should occur in a manner to preserve existing trees vegetation and natural topographic features as much as possible   noise a design objectives 1 site planning should be sensitive to offsite noise sources affecting the neighborhood every attempt should be made to reduce offsite noise impacts such as interstate highways by a increasing the distance from the noise source b planting dense overstory and understory landscaping c building solid walls between the noise source and receiver d constructing berms between the noise source and receiver b density incentives 1 upon the recommendation of the planning commission a two percent 2% density increase may be allowed for the effective reduction of offsite noise to qualify for incentives the offsite noise affecting the site should be greater than 75 dba typically a thoroughfare or interstate highway to reduce exterior noise the applicant may use perimeter screening blocking the line of sigh between the noise source and the receiver walls berms or a combination thereof may be used if walls are used they must be of heavy construction and without cracks or breaks   architectural design the architecture of residential development is a key element in determining the character and function of a neighborhood the character of a neighborhood should create a strong feeling of identity the function of housing should meet the needs of the occupants and be specifically tuned to regional and site features building designs that create variety and do not look monotonous if replicated throughout the development are required such designs should include the following 1 side and rear building elevations garages carports and all accessory structures with the same level of design aesthetic quality and architectural detailing 2 porches varied rooflines and varied facade depths to create variety and individuality of each dwelling within the building 3 windows and projecting wall surfaces to break up larger wall surfaces and establish visual interest and to provide visibility of the street and other public spaces to encourage social interaction 4 protective entry courts common vestibules covered breeze ways or enclosed stair halls to reduce the number of visible doors unless designed in a row house or townhouse manner oriented toward the street 5 garages designed to be integrated with the building design or sites so as to avoid long monotonous rows of garage doors and building walls locate and orient garages so they are deemphasized and do not visually dominate the building facade or the streetscape a design objectives 1 the architectural design of housing units should be designed to meet the regional climate and specific site characteristics the regional climate is temperate and requires protection from wind rain and snow although there is a significant number of heating and cooling days there are moderate temperatures as a result the following architectural elements should be provided a protective entry courts covered breeze ways or enclosed stair halls  b sufficient roof overhang to shield summer sun and still allow winter sun penetration where applicable  and c individual units with adequate outside air ventilation doubleloaded units typically do not offer adequate natural air flow 2 specific site characteristics such as topography and amenities should help determine the building footprint a steep sloping sites may require variations of two or threestory units and attached garages b elongated sites with linear amenities may require linear building footprints c clustered units are well suited for both flat and sloping sites clustering offers greater site efficiency and welldefined common areas d the rectangular doubleloaded building configuration should be avoided these designs typically lack interest and fail to create a strong sense of neighborhood 3 the architectural design of each unit or building should be designed to a residential neighborhood scale specifically architecture should respond to perceived density building mess and details a a strong sense of neighborhood should be created by reducing the perceived density of a project common vestibules and enclosed breeze ways can reduce the number of visible doors b the sense of scale is another factor in establishing a strong sense of neighborhood architecturally the massing of individual building should reinforce a neighborhood scale by 1 providing vertical and horizontal offsets in units this serves to break up rooflines define private outdoor areas allow greater views light and air to unit interiors if horizontalvertical offsets are to be used they should be of sufficient dimension to achieve the desired effect c use porches railings fascia boards and trim to enhance buildings character d locate and orient garages so they are deemphasized and do not visually dominate the building facade or the streetscape alternative garage orientations may include access from the side or rear of the structure or setback a minimum two 2feet from the front wall of the habitable living space for frontoriented garages e decorative building materials on the front facade and all other facades visible from the street f a useable covered front entry porch with a minimum depth of seven 7 feet and a minimum area of seventy 70 square feet g heavy textured dimensional roofing material b density incentives upon the recommendation of the planning commission a fifteen percent 15% density increase may be allowed for enhanced

the site plan review process the residential and infill design criteria will be applied in addition to existing city ordinances and policies   residential design guidelines the intent of these guidelines is to increase the livability and the appearance of singlefamily and moderatedensity and multifamily complexes the design of such development contributes to the overall image of the city and is a significant component of the communitys residential mix where multifamily buildings are clustered into complexes rather than integrated into mixeduse traditional neighborhoods it is expected that such complexes will be designed to establish strong neighborhood environments a as much as possible developments should include a mix of housing styles such as townhomes condominiums garden apartments duplexes and singlefamily residential units to create a mixeduse community with housing options for residents of all ages and incomes b when located adjacent to singlefamily dwellings the design and appearance of multifamily dwellings shall incorporate similar massing height roof pitch and architectural features  including front porches  cornice lines  horizontal lines of windows  and architectural embellishments such as shutters dormers belvederes chimneys etc to create the appearance of single family dwellings c site designs should create a sense of neighborhood which includes 1 an internal vehicular circulation system reflective of a singlefamily residential street system as opposed to looped systems which may appear disjointed and confusing 2 buildings sited with front entrances and porches oriented toward streets drives and plazas rather than clustered around parking lots 3 parking lots located behind buildings or screened from view from internal streets unless it is deemed appropriate to use a parking lot as a buffer from an arterial street 4 walkways that connect all buildings with parking areas play areas club houses and sidewalks along adjoining streets as well as neighboring stores offices and transit stops 5 centrally located plazas clubhouses pools and recreational facilities 6 access to transit stops and neighborhood retail centers whenever possible   residential design guidelines for residential singlefamily residential moderatedensity residential and apartments development the following design guidelines are recommended during site plan review of moderatedensity and multifamily development proposals andor in r2 and r3 pd reviews the city should implement the following residential design guidelines in plat reviews of singlefamily subdivision and r1 pd proposals the city should refer to the guidelines to the extent applicable   site planning 1 respect the street and locate buildings on the site so that they reinforce street frontages 2 respond to existing and planned adjacent uses 3 respond to traffic parking circulation and safety issues light and glare noise odors dust control and security 4 provide as many private ground level entries to individual units as possible 5 ensure that all building entries are prominent and visible 6 provide each unit with its own visual identity and individual address whenever possible 7 maintain existing setback patterns projects should not be located in front or behind the average setback line of the neighborhood 8 provide pedestrian accessibility to adjacent uses with gates pedestrian walkways crossings etc 9 locate common facilities  such as community rooms and laundries  centrally and link them to common outdoor space 10 locate buildings and landscaping to maximize solar access during cooler months and to control it during warmer months maximize natural ventilation sunlight and views for each unit 11 adopt lot coverage limitations a limit lot coverage for moderatedensity developments to no more than 50 percent for principal and accessory structures and 60 percent including offstreet parking b limit lot coverage for moderatedensity and multifamily developments to no more than 40 percent for principal and structures and 70 percent including offstreet parking   parking  multifamily 1 parking does not dominate the site the building or the street 2 place parking lots at rear or side of the site to allow a majority of dwelling units to front on the street 3 build multiple small parking lots in lieu of one large lot 4 plant trees and shrubs to soften the overall impact of parking areas and to provide shade and noise reduction 5 avoid blank walls facing the street on buildings with parking garages 6 if blank walls are unavoidable decorate with artwork display cases vines and good quality durable materials 7 place parking lot in proximity to dwelling units to allow for casual surveillance and to minimize walking distance 8 separate bicycle and pedestrian paths from vehicular traffic 9 designate vehicle free areas for bicycle and pedestrian safety and enjoyment   public open spacemultifamily 1 design outdoor open space as outdoor rooms and avoid undifferentiated empty spaces 2 provide public open space for social or cultural activities 3 provide direct access to open space for each dwelling unit while controlling nonresident access 4 locate public open spaces so that they can be viewed from individual units preferably from the kitchen living room or dining room 5 locate play areas centrally and to allow for adult supervision from dwelling units andor from a central facility such as a laundry 6 provide lighting from a variety of sources at appropriate intensities and qualities for safety 7 provide energyefficient lighting   private open space 1 provide each household with some form of private open space including patio porch deck balcony yard or shared entry porches or balconies 2 private open space should be easily accessible  physically and visually  from individual units 3 screen balconies for privacy but avoid solid walls that prevent residents particularly small children from looking out 4 provide fencing to insure privacy and to help define boundaries between public and private open space   landscaping 1 design landscaping as an integral part of the project 2 provide a variety of hardy native plant species  trees shrubs groundcover  that are easy to water and maintain 3 avoid large empty paved areas 4 provide a variety of seating in landscaped areas 5 include paths to accommodate children adults bicycles skate boards shopping carts walkers pets furniture moving etc 6 provide appropriate lighting to insure that paths are safe   architecture 1 maintain overall height of structures to that of other buildings in the neighborhood except where the local plan calls for redeveloping the area at much greater height and density 2 relate first floor to the street and insure that it is consistent with the first floors in neighboring buildings 3 relate size and bulk of project so that it is consistent with buildings in the immediate neighborhood 4 eliminate boxlike forms with large unvaried roofs by using a variety of building forms and roof shapes this may be accomplished by creating clusters of units variations in height setback and roof shape 5 give the building visual and architectural complexity by varying the height color setback materials texture landscaping trim and roof shape 6 enhance views and make spaces feel larger by maximizing the number of windows 7 screen ground floor windows from walkways to provide privacy 8 respect the placement and quality of front doors in neighboring homes 9 break up the facade of horizontal buildings into smaller components by utilizing vertical adjacent structures 10 ensure that rhythm size and proportion of openings windows doors are similar to good quality buildings in the neighborhood 11 use porches stairs railings fascia boards and trim to enhance buildings character 12 select building materials and color that are complementary to the surrounding area and have high levels of recycled content whenever possible   moderatedensity examples recommended the design creates visual relief from concrete and driveways in duplex and fourplex site plan also interest use of varying roof planes materials recommended landscaping softens the density public and private open space adds to the residential feel recommended grass and landscaped areas provided separation between drives and soften the main entrances these additional pervious surfaces define private space and help create a residential character combined with the side yards and rear private areas density is controlled   multifamily examples recommended the design of multifamily housing can make high density development more acceptable such as use of brick and similar materials private access to the outdoors makes the housing livable undulating facades and use of a variety of architectural details create interest graphic from city of overland park kansas design guidelines manual recommendedelderly housing design standards for elderly housing can allow for greater density while protecting appearance and use values such as private open space not recommended the main entrances are varied but grass areas are not sufficient extensive concrete areas compromise the livabilityunless softened by greater side yards and rear yards   neotraditional planning guidelines the following neotraditional planning guidelines should serve as guidelines when reviewing proposals for new residential development the purpose is to make varieties of residential density more acceptable in pleasant hill in order to diminish local resistance to higher density rezoning requests they could also be applied to infill residential development  and the second set of standards is geared specifically to infill housing 1 encourage the development of logical interconnected street grids and avoid jigsaw street systems interconnected gridlike street systems allow for a more dispersed traffic pattern because there are multiple routes to move from one place to another within the city a grid configuration of streets helps to minimize peak hour traffic flows in addition these interconnected systems are more comprehensible and thus easier for visitors and residents alike to find their way around the city on the contrary jigsaw street systems with no apparent repetition or order can be disorienting and tend to funnel traffic to collectortype roads even for short distance travel this situation contributes to unnecessarily heavy traffic on main roads at peak traffic periods it should be noted that a gridded street pattern does not necessarily require all streets to be straight the design of the roadway system should work with the land the basic goal for the citys overall road layout is a system of northsouth roads that regularly intersect with eastwest roads 2 promote the development of treelined streets pleasant hill should adopt an ambitious street tree program for new development street trees provide shade for streets and sidewalks improve aesthetics and generally encourage pedestrian use of sidewalks street trees also maintain a ceiling or canopy that further imbues a pedestrian scale to the streetscape 3 require landscaping primarily of mature trees and existing vegetation trees shrubs flowers and other elements of the surrounding environment of a housing area greatly contribute to the quality of life within that area shade wind breaks beautification and attraction of songbirds and other wildlife are all benefits of substantial plant communities within housing areas 4 require grass or planting strips between curbs and sidewalks this space provides safety for pedestrians on the sidewalks and creates an area suitable for streettree plantings 5 encourage front porches and other private areas in multifamily town homes front porches allow homeowners to comfortably spend more time near the front yard and street this creates a greater opportunity to know ones neighbors maintain a casual surveillance of the area and thereby maintain a safe residential neighborhood this also reinforces a smalltown village ambiance 6 require sidewalks on both sides of public streets one of the most significant elements of pedestrian atmosphere and function is that residents can easily walk to other places within the community by placing sidewalks andor bike lanes on each side of all streets pedestrian use is indicated as a priority in the community because of a prominent safe and accessible system 7 promote flexible standards to allow differing setback requirements encourage more green space within a residential community by providing room for more backyard shade trees landscaping and in instances where existing vegetation is nearby more beneficial wildlife habitat 8 encourage visually appealing points of beautification within subdivisions the development of points of beautification within new subdivisions can enhance the perception of neighborhood a characteristic that is important in the development and maintenance of smalltown atmosphere beautification areas should be encouraged particularly at entrances but should not encourage the inclusion of subdivision identification monument signs 9 develop fence specifications to control type of fencing used along arterial and collector roads in residential areas privacy fences prohibit visual access to residential property and make casual surveillance by law enforcement and neighbors more difficult therefore they should be allowed as partial screens around small private areas only not as perimeter fending visual surveillance is an important part of creating a safe residential neighborhood environment   infill housing development guidelines without direction from adopted standards infill development may damage the existing neighborhood fabric figure b1 inappropriate infill housing shows how typical infill housing with little consideration of surrounding development meets the goal of filling a vacant lot but detracts from rather than complements or enhances the existing character in this example a moderate sized single story house center is shown in relation to two houses with historical features ends although the infill house has an appropriate orientation and similar scale the mass proportion rooflines pitch and architectural features are inconsistent with the character of the established neighborhood figure b1 inappropriate infill housing the infill house center has little relation to existing houses with little or no change in the footprint and square footage a functional house can be complementary to the surrounding development and an asset to the neighborhood figure b2 appropriate infill housing shows how additions such as a stoop dormers window treatments and a steeper roof pitch can substantially change the character of a house figure b2 appropriate infill housing with a few additions and no change in square footage the infill house center blends with existing houses massing proportion rooflines pitch and character are similar to surrounding development additional considerations should include building setbacks entry features and orientation garage locations and dominance landscaping and screening of mechanical equipment figure b3 inappropriate infill lot development shows common mistakes made by infill development the lot to the furthest left illustrate show the garage often becomes the dominant feature this lot also shows how the entry is recessed and shielded from view by the rest of the house which is inconsistent with the traditional development patterns although greatly reduced in dominance the second lot from the left illustrates a prominent garage with no variation in the front facade the second lot from the right shows no variation in rooflines and no architectural detailing finally the lot to the furthest right shows an inappropriate setback that disrupts the rhythm of the existing pattern of the block figure b3 inappropriate infill lot development inappropriate infill development disrupts the rhythms and patterns established by the existing development figure b4 appropriate infill lot development shows how simple modifications to site plans can improve infill housing this figure shows how garages can be located to the rear or side of the lot to be accessed from the street or alley and reduce their dominance the second lot from the left shows how an attached garage can be recessed to reduce its dominance and provide variation in the front facade this figure also illustrates how the addition stoops dormers porches and variation in rooflines can be used to substantially change appearance without substantially changing the building footprints or square footage consistent setbacks and dominant entries as shown below help retain the blocks streetscape and rhythm figure b4 appropriate infill lot development appropriate infill development complements and continues the rhythm and patterns of the neighborhood in addition to providing general housing opportunities infill housing development is recommended to fill the need for smaller singlefamily housing although smaller housing can help fill the need for entrylevel housing development considerations do not have to be put aside figure b5 sample plans for 1000 square foot house provides an example of how a house with modest floor plans can be designed to provide traditional character to address infill development additional consideration should be given use infill development guidelines for residential neighborhoods these guidelines should be promoted to preserve and perpetuate the character of the pleasant hills existing residential development and ensure compatibility between new and existing development in order to help ensure that guidelines do not hamper development these guidelines should be promoted by staff when advising developers and builders on infill development projects figure b5 appropriate infill housing although modest in size exterior details such as dormers a porch and multiple rooflines provide character and emulate traditional development styles to achieve the above objectives the following guidelines are recommended 1 applicability prior to the issuance of a building permit all infill residential projects shall be reviewed by the city staff as applicable according to the following standards for the purpose of these standards infill residential projects shall be any new development or redevelopment proposed within an existing established residential area unless otherwise approved as part of a restricted overlay historic overlay or planned residential overlay district 2 guidelines the physical form and pattern of existing established residential neighborhoods should be maintained to the greatest extent possible infill design should incorporate the following principles building orientation should reflect the predominant neighborhood pattern the fronttofront backtoback relationship of typical residential neighborhoods establishes security privacy and a very identifiable streetscape that should be maintained new construction should address the street in a manner consistent with surrounding buildings in most cases building facades should be parallel to the street front entries and walkways should address the street directly or in a manner consistent with the adjacent properties vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns should be maintained by infill projects neighborhood open space patterns and side front and rear yards should be visually preserved the spacing of infill units front rear and side yards should generally reflect the spacing of existing homes in the neighborhood building heights should be compatible with the average height of homes in the neighborhood each project should be particularly sensitive to planning and design of contiguous parcels the streetscape and landscaping should be designed to reflect existing neighborhood forms rhythm and spacing architecturally project design should represent compatible building form  roof types slope and overhang  horizontal and vertical proportions  exterior materials finishes and details architectural details such as gables porches windows shutters and awnings should be used to create interest in the street facade and minimize monotony the style and image of the neighborhood should be reinforced by infill development where an established style and image cannot be established infill design has more latitude and should strive to achieve a stronger neighborhood image garages should be visual or physically secondary to the primary residential structure to maintain the residential and pedestrian character of the street where possible garages should be recessed garages for corner lot development are encouraged to be located and accessed at the rear or side of the primary structure in no case should the garage dominate the street facade heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment should be located at the rear of the structure and screened from adjacent properties appendix c  moderatedensity and multifamily development procedures footnotes  4
