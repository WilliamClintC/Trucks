areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art i  b 4142010 purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area art i  c 4142010 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood

of the city then the user if he elects may install additional approved meters at the users expense in such a manner as to measure the quantity of water actually entering the potw system from the premises of such user and the quantity of water used to determine the wastewater service charge and abnormal wastewater surcharge shall be the quantity of water actually entering the potw as so

commission austin texas and dated  which is attached to this article and made a part hereof the various zones are hereby established and defined as follows 1 approach zone approach zone is established beneath the approach surface at each end of all runways on the municipal airport for nonprecision instrument landings and takeoffs the approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10200 feet beyond each end of the runway its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway 2 transition zones transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the zoning map transition surfaces symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map transition surfaces extend outward from a line 250 feet on either side of the centerline of the runway for the length of such runway plus 200 feet on each end the line is parallel to and level with the runway centerlines the transition surfaces along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the horizontal surface further transition surfaces are established adjacent to approach surfaces for the entire length of the approach surfaces these transition surfaces have variable widths as shown on the zoning map such transition surfaces flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach surfaces from the base of such surfaces and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontal and conical surfaces 3 horizontal zones the area beneath a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of

surface at a slope of  for a horizontal distance of 4000 feet  141979 height limitations a except as otherwise provided in this article no structure or tree shall be erected altered allowed to grow or

extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces 3 horizontal zone that area beneath the horizontal surface which is located 150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 419 feet above mean sea level 4 conical zone that area beneath the conical surface which is one foot in height fore each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation 5 excepted height limitations nothing in this division shall be construed as prohibiting the growth construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 20 feet above the surface of the land b where an area is covered by more than one height limitation the more restrictive
