sewer main the first indication of sewer failure or potential failure may vary it is the intention of the water pollution control division to cooperate with the individual property owners and the plumbers in the resolution of these sanitary failures within the following guidelines bsewer failure  excavation 1settlement of ground surface in some cases failure of a sewer line is first indicated by settlement of the ground surface near a failure this can happen before there is any apparent malfunction in either the building service line or the city sewer main when this occurs over or near the connection of the building service line to the city sewer main it is not always possible to determine before excavation whether the failure is in the building service line the city sewer main or both if there is no indication at this time that the building service line has failed the water pollution control division will make an attempt to determine the problem by inspection of the city sewer main if the problem is with the city sewer main or if the city is unable to inspect the city sewer the division will make the initial excavation to determine the source of the problem 2sewer stoppagebackup if the backup of sewage is the first indication of failure the water pollution control division will assist by investigating to determine if there is a stoppage in the city sewer main iif the city sewer main has deteriorated to the point where it appears to be the source of the problem or if the city sewer main contains a stoppage that cannot be removed by conventional methods then the water pollution control division will make the initial excavation to determine the extent of the failure iiif the city sewer main is not obstructed but is open and flowing and the private sewer line has failed it then becomes the responsibility of the property owner to make the necessary repairs within seven days in this case the water pollution control division will not make the initial excavation 3excavation requirement it shall be the total responsibility of the party making the excavation to make it of adequate size for water pollution control division personnel to work safely for inspection of the sewer andor repairing of the wye connection csewer repairs 1city sewer is broken if the city sewer main is broken or in such poor condition that it is impractical to make a new wye connection

and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and

of the smallest square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any panel or material forming an integral part of the background of the display against which it is placed other than structural supports but including structural supports for temporary or incidental signs image 2computation of area of multifaced signs the sign area for a sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area measured as provided in this subsection a of all sign faces visible from any one point when two sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart the sign area is computed by measuring one of the faces as provided in this subsection a image bsign area  attached signs 1where sign size is prescribed as a percentage of wall area the wall area is a continuous portion of a building facade below the roofline or major architectural feature as viewed by a person approaching the building 2where sign size is prescribed as a factor of building frontage the building frontage is the width of the exterior wall on which the sign is located as viewed by a person approaching the building for the purpose of measurement the wall used as building frontage need not be on the same wall plane image 3for an attached sign which is framed outlined painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display the area and dimensions include the entire portion within the background or frame image 4for an attached sign comprised of individual letters figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure with no distinct mounting surface such as a board or plastic face other than the wall the area is calculated by applying the smallest regular geometric shape possible rectangle circle trapezoid triangle etc around all letters figures or elements 5when separate elements are organized to form a single sign but are separated by open space the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form or combination of forms which comprises all of the display areas including the space between different elements 6the sign area does not include any supporting framework bracing artistic elements not part of the sign copy or decorative fence or wall when the fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself image image csign height the height of a freestanding sign means the vertical distance from the top of the highest part of a sign whether the highest part be the sign copy or support structure on which the sign is

the appearance and existing investments downtown image the design guidelines offer a vision for an approach to downtown design that can be beneficial both to developers and to the community the concepts for downtown development encourage the highest level of design quality and creativity while emphasizing key downtown design concepts such as but not limited to  maintaining the street wall at the front property line   enhancing the design of street facades   ensuring pedestrian compatibility   designing public spaces at a pedestrian scale   creating visual interest  and  maintaining design integrity and compatibility with surrounding structures a mix of uses including office retail housing or other uses within a given project is encouraged whether it is a single building or a

properties for these exceptions projects must follow the applicable design guidelines or other standards that specifically govern alterations to those properties in place of these guidelines within the boundaries of the d zoning districts designated national register historic districts these guidelines are amended by separate design guidelines as adopted any project requiring a building permit must comply with approved design guidelines the guidelines established herein are not intended to restrict creative solutions these guidelines describe ways to achieve the stated purpose of the

fences row of trees hedges or any combination of these elements the height and placement of such features should be in accordance with cpted crime prevention design principles 6 while it is important to provide adequate interior lighting for safety and comfort it should be controlled to avoid spill out on the adjacent streets creating excessive glare architecture and context 1 the architectural design of new buildings and the rehabilitation of existing buildings should be sensitive to the existing built and natural environment within which they are constructed the architecture of the existing downtown buildings should provide examples of architectural themes rhythm materials and forms image 2 new construction is not required to implement any particular architectural style but should be designed to be compatible with the scale form and materials of surrounding structures by applying these guidelines public infrastructure improvements 1 all new public infrastructure projects roads sidewalks public buildings and streetlights should meet high standards of design quality and provide significant secondary benefits in the form of major public space improvements these projects

amenities such as follows   image  landscaping    open space    seating    public art    however walls fences and dense planting that visually seclude the interior space from the sidewalk should be avoided   history and identity 1 all projects are encouraged to express local history and identity ornamental design elements and works of public art image 2 new development projects or renovation of existing structures should be designed to preserve the historic resources that exist on the site and reinforce the historical context within which they are developed 3 in the event that it is not possible to preserve the entirety of a historic building the retention of historic facades is encouraged street and block organization 1 new buildings and development should respect the existing organization of the city and the street and block patterns that exist 2 superblock developments that join together one or more blocks are discouraged 3 where it is feasible street grids should be extended reestablished or newly created in areas of largescale redevelopment 4 new buildings or pedestrian bridges should not bridge across or block access to existing streets entrances and vistas 1 buildings and new development projects should be sensitively designed and sited so as to preserve the key vistas and gateways to downtown and views of the state capitol 2 new buildings should not

its informal proposal for the technical upgrade of the topeka cable system the following pages outline the companys proposal for the upgrade including the technical specifications and standards for the operation of the upgraded system and a preliminary construction timetable for completion of the project tci of kansas inc is committed to the longterm goal of maintaining excellence in service to its customers the upgrade of the system plays an important part in accomplishing that goal in topeka tci of kansas inc proposes upon the effective date of a renewed franchise agreement for a term of 15 years to commence an upgrade of the topeka system to a 550 mhz 80plus channel capacity system utilizing fiber optical technology in fibertofeeder architecture design upon completion of the upgrade the company proposes to initially activate 10 additional channels of programming on the system the proposed system will provide integrated stereo sound where available and emergency alert capability we look forward to our continuing relationship with topeka with confidence in our commitment to future excellence technical upgrade tci of kansas inc proposes upon the signing of a 15year franchise renewal document to technically upgrade the topeka kansas cable system incorporating optical fiber technology our proposal for the topeka cable system is a fibertothefeeder design the optical fiber technology is one of the newer tools which the cable industry employs to enhance system capability and reliability and to increase channel capacity upon completion of the upgrade the cable system will be built to a 550 mhz bandwidth capable of providing in excess of 80 channels it is estimated that this upgrade will be completed within 36 months of the effective date of the franchise renewal agreement the upgraded system will also provide twoway interactive links serving all three current outside origination points city hall washburn university and usd 501 additionally we propose dark fiber links between three additional locations topeka high school highland park high school and topeka west high school would be ideal sites for interactive hubs all interactive sites would connect back to a single centralized point such as the system headend or an access center fiber optic construction optical fiber technology uses very thin strands of glass to carry light signals generated by laser transmitters or other light sources information can be carried by light in much the same way as information is carried by electronic signals over the copper twisted pair wire used by telephone systems for voice and data and over the coaxial cable used by cable systems for transmitting video and data fiber has wider bandwidth or carrying capacity than traditional copper twisted pair wire although fiber in its current applications does not have more usable bandwidth than coaxial cable the primary advantage of fiber over coaxial cable is that a signal can be carried greater distances with lower loss of power and subsequent need for amplification amplifiers are needed to strengthen cable signals where long stretches of coaxial cable exist long stretches of cable requiring cascades of amplifiers can result in poor signal quality or a loss in the number of channels that can be delivered fiber has a greater ability to carry signals without losing power and thus fiber allows systems to reduce the number of amplifiers between the headend and the customer or to eliminate amplifiers in longer supertrunk lines the elimination of amplifiers results in improved quality and reliability other advantages from the cable industrys installation of optical fiber include cost effective upgrades of channel capacity the existing coaxial cable to every home is theoretically capable of carrying 100  200 channels reducing the number of amplifiers on a cascade between headend and customer use of fiber allows significant channel upgrades without expensive replacement of the cable to each individual home or local loop improved reliability because there are fewer amplifiers in a typical cascade to fail in a fiberenhanced system there are fewer customers affected by any given individual amplifier failure improved signal quality because of the reduced number of amplifiers between the headend and customer transmissions along fiber optic cable degrade far less quickly and result in stronger clearer picture at the receiving end cable industry use of fiber  pointtopoint communications fiber technology is being employed by the cable industry to improve communications that require high capacity connections between two locations known as pointtopoint communications for example linking separate headends together this application is sometime referred to as supertrunking other pointtopoint fiber applications in use by the industry include linking remote production studios for example facilities which record local government meetings for the government access channel with the headend or connecting the headend with a satellite dish or antenna which for some reason must be located away from the headend cable industry use of fiber  evolutionary applications the more evolutionary application of fiber is currently known by a number of names such as fiber backbone and cable area network in such application a fiber link is constructed between the system headend and a point somewhere in the distribution network evolutionary applications bring fiber closer to the customer which means that the signal that reaches the customer has not been degraded by as many amplifiers and other electronics the highly flexible system that results from evolutionary fiber deployment allows cable systems to deliver more channels to improve system reliability and to reduce operating costs fiber backbone or cable area network applications are considered evolutionary because placing fiber in this portion of the network not only makes technical and economic sense today but also sets the stage for further developments in fiber and other cable technologies which will lead to significant channel capacity expansion and the introduction of innovative program services another new application of fiber is called fibertothefeeder ftf the 550 megahertz mhz ftf design takes fiber all the way to the feeder plant which is the last stage before the actual connection to the home the 550 mhz ftf design is the latest in a series of logical costeffective steps which the cable industry has taken to deploy the useful technology of optical fiber growth in cables use of fiber the 20 largest multiple system operators msos have begun installation of fiber within their systems the amount of fiber installed by these companies has increased by 400 percent since 198 with over 13 million subscribers now served by systems utilizing fiber optics current estimates indicate that cable industry deployment of fiber is expected to grow at an annual rate of 25 percent over the next decade cable systems of the future programmingbandwidth expansion fiber optics high definition television hdtv compressed digital video interactivity telephony and personal communications networks pcn are among the advances for which cable operators must plan in plant construction today the cable industrys research and development consortium cable labs currently envisions future cable systems to be hybrid fibercoax systems this design melds the evolutionary fiber thinking applications as they are being implemented today with coaxial cable used to connect to the home the resulting hybrid looks like a star architecture but it has none of the costburdens of the switchedstar system used by tide telephone industry further it has construction economies similar to a treeandbranch system but none of the growth barriers cable industry use of fiber optics provides all excellent platform for future evolutionary growth specific futureready provisions include the following bandwidth expandable all cable and feeder electronics housings and chassis are qualified for full channel loading at 550 mhz or more future bandwidth expansion is expected to be further eased by new hybrid amdigital transmission schemes see compressed digital video section below lasers photodiode detectors and optical transmission fiber all facilitate relatively easy expansion toward 1000 mhz bandwidths advanced amplifiers line extenders use costefficient powerdoubled or quadrapower technology these advanced amplifiers further facilitate bandwidth expansion and future channel additions optical splitters todays system optical splitters are located in the headends rather than in the field this allows all option of more easily converting the optical network in the future future fieldsplitting and wavelength division multiplexing wdm expansion options are available for additional expansion optical amplifiers based on laboratory performance of erbiumdoped fiber amplifiers operating at 1550 nm fiber optic node location decisions incorporate projected future plant upgrades using narrow linewidth light sources laboratory experiments have demonstrated that 1550 nm transmission over standard 1310 nm fiber can be accomplished with no dispersionrelated increase in noise or distortion other experiments have shown high optical amplifier outputs of with no measurable contribution to system distortion and manageable noise figures dualwindow 13101550nm fiber and optical passives are used in current construction high definition television ftf systems provide the bandwidth expansion and system flexibility required to handle an hdtv transmission system currently envisioned cable televisions growth plan assumes that hdtv technology will prove in first for premium services and that all digital hdtv transmission will become the norm therefore provisions for hdtv are similar to those for compressed digital video below compressed digital video the cable industry is ready for expected amdigital video hybrid transmission schemes based on a david grugg iii analysis published in the ncta 91 technical papers a 4 to 6 db distortion improvement factor is projected for amdigital systems compared to all analog channel loading systems the use of digital carriers above 550 mhz also will ease high frequency tap level requirements because the digital signals can tolerate more noise cable will not only increase its reach in the future but the capabilities of the cable infrastructure will be dramatically improved industry plans call for spending $18 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade plant and equipment optical fiber will be an integral part of this upgrading and by 1999 will account for almost forty percent of the total annual investment in trunk and feeder cable fiber is viewed not as an end in itself but as a complement to already sophisticated cable systems which will improve system performance and will enable operators to deliver a wider variety of programming and services our proposal for topeka is the fibertothefeeder design through continued development and application of fiber optics and other innovative technologies the cable industry is guaranteed to be at the forefront of communications technology offering the video network of the future today service area the upgraded cable system will be accomplished in a manner that continues to serve all areas currently served and so that newly annexed or currently unserved areas can be served in accordance with the criteria stated below new or unserviced areas for areas annexed after  grantee will extend service to businesses and residences requesting service at no charge to the subscriber beyond normal installation charges where such business or residence is within 150 feet of existing cable plant or where residential density meets or exceeds 15 homes per quarter mile measured from existing cable plant where a subscriber requesting service does not meet the above criteria the grantee will extend service to such subscriber on a cost sharing basis according to the following formula total cost per quarter mile   grantees share 15 total cost less grantees share   subscribers share number of requesting subscribers initial programming we at tci of kansas inc are committed to providing our customers with a comprehensive and wellbalanced mix or programming this mix should be reliable and proven both in terms of subscriber popularity and longterm success following franchise renewal a wide variety of services will include at a minimum television broadcast signals and an array of satellitedelivered cable programming the company recognizes that its programming fare should be in harmony with the needs and interests of the community ensuring customer satisfaction and commercial viability the company feels it must cave ultimate flexibility in its programming decisions so it can respond to market conditions and customer demand it reserves that right to make changes from time to time should for instance a service become unavailable or should programming become available that better responds to the needs and interests of customers at completion of the system upgrade project we propose an initial activation of 10 additional channels in addition to those currently being carried two of the 10 would be set aside for additional peg use the new and extremely popular low priced premium service encore would be added a regional sports network such as prime sports network would be a positive addition to the expanded basic package two channels would be dedicated to pay per view with the remaining slots being added to the basic service the service lineup would then consist of 46 activated channels a 32 channel basic service including four channels dedicated to peg a seven channel expanded basic service five premium channels and two pay per view channels emergency alert capability the company has installed a device in the headend that can override the audio portion of each cable channel and substitute an audio emergency message with this system in place fire flood severe weather warnings and civil defense alerts can be cable cast over the system to the entire topeka cable community by authorized community officials the civil emergency alert system is installed in the headend where it is backed up by the standby power facility it is remotely activated by using either a dedicated line a touchtone telephone or a radio control link once the proper code is introduced into the system the telephone can be used to deliver the emergency message the company requests that the city of topeka hold tci of kansas inc its agents employees officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the citys emergency use of its facilities the company will work with the city to incorporate the emergency alert notification into the communitys disaster plan high definition televisionadvanced television enhancing the picture quality for our customers is an ongoing objective of tci of kansas inc and its ultimate parent telecommunications inc high definition television hdtv is one technology that potentially offers viewers a more lifelike picture by providing sharper colors and contrasts and an enhanced perspective of real depth the company has invested a significant amount of money and energy in researching and developing hdtv so that it is prepared for the advent of this exciting advance in picture quality currently however no national standards or policies for hdtv have been established by the national television standards committee this must occur first because not only will this technology affect cable operators it will have a dramatic impact on the broadcast and equipment manufacturing industries in addition most presentday television sets in consumer households are not able to receive or retransmit this type of quality another technology that can provide hdtvlike picture quality is called advanced television with this technology which may be available in the nearer term customers will be able to receive an enhanced video signal by using their existing televisions sets offering our customers a new and enhanced visual experience of these new technologies represents a longterm commitment by the company pay per view the upgraded system will maintain and enhance our current pay per view capability with channel space dedicated to pay per view use stereo the system upgrade will include the additional headend equipment necessary to provide integrated stereo sound on those channels and programs that are originated and available to the company in stereo technical specifications and standards the technical specifications and construction procedures which the company strive to maintain throughout the topeka system are detailed below construction standards materials and components used will be of the highest quality and of technical conservative design for example distribution or feeder lines shall be constructed using lowloss aluminum coaxial cable to ensure reliability and continuing good service system components will be carefully selected to maintain system rf shielding integrity all splices and connectors will be of the integral sleeve type housedrop cable will be doubleshielded with a layer of foil and 67 percent braid coverage to minimize the occurrence of major system outages and other problems the company will take the following precautions  all indoor headend components will be in an airconditioned environment to insure optimum functioning  the system will be bonded and grounded  all towers antennas satellite receive stations and other exposed equipment will be properly grounded standard construction practices to be followed by tci of kansas inc dictate that coaxial cable splices shall be held to a minimum be properly waterproofed and contain adequate thermal expansion loops to absorb the expansion and contraction of the cable due to temperature variation reliability of service the company considers reliability of service second only to safety in the design and construction of a cable system with respect to the latter construction practices shall be accordance with standard utility pole regulations and the statutes and regulations currently in effect listed below  rules and
