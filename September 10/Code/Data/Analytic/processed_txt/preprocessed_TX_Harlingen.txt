insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the elective commission of harlingen texas does ordain as follows  iiexh a 272018 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  iiexh a 272018 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 provide information to potential buyers to determine if property is in a flood area as defined by fema  8 avoid increasing flood levels or flood hazards or creating new flood hazard areas  9 minimize public and private property losses due to flooding  and 10 preserve the natural floodplains where at all possible  iiexh a 272018 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish reduction of flood loss this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or control the construction of flood barriers by grading dredging excavation and filling which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 imposing a regulatory 1% annual chance floodplain that requires using the ultimate development of the watershed to determine the 1% annual chance water surface elevations new developments must
