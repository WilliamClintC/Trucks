watershed and drainageway buffers a purpose watershed and drainageway buffers provide strips of natural vegetation that serve to remove pollutants from stormwater runoff before they can reach a water supply source or a watercourse that drains to the water supply source they do so by allowing infiltration of runoff and filtration of pollutants ground and soil slowing down runoff flow to allow settling and deposition of pollutants and providing vegetation that absorbs pollutants roots the provision of vegetated undisturbed buffers within water supply watersheds therefore serves as an important and effective method of maintaining the quality of public water supply sources and protecting those sources from the potential polluting activities associated with development within the watershed b required watershed buffers 1 100footwide watershed buffers shall be maintained around water supply impoundments or intakes measured perpendicular to the shoreline of the water supply
