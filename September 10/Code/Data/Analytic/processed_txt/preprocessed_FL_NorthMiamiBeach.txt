findings purpose intent 1 the mayor and city council of the city of north miami beach desire to adopt an ordinance prohibiting rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors on certain streets located in the city because such vendors peddlers and solicitors pose a danger to themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic  2 based upon statistics collected by the surface transportation policy project on average five hundred sixtyfive 565 pedestrians are killed every year in florida of which ninetynine 99 are in miamidade county and the miamifort lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous areas in the united states for pedestrians  3 numerous types of rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors operate or may seek to operate within the city of north miami beach including but not limited to children adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities  vendors who sell flowers newspapers and other products and people who seek donations or to distribute information  4 rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city  5 roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors  6 over the past ten 10 years at least ten 10 rightofway vendors peddlers or solicitors have been killed by motor vehicles in the south florida area and many more have been seriously injured including a sun sentinel newspaper vendor who was struck by a car while carrying papers on us 1 and broward boulevard in fort lauderdale on   7 the presence of rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic  8 the road network in the city is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic  9 it is the intention of the mayor and city council to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and consequently the city staff has analyzed each of the major roads within the city and has determined that the roads listed in paragraph c below pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by rightofway vendors and solicitors and therefore the city council has determined that the prohibition on rightofway vendors peddlers and solicitors shall be limited to those listed roads   10 it is the finding of the city council that many other alternative channels of communication other than rightofway vending peddling and solicitation exist for persons who seek to exercise their first amendment freedoms such as but by no means limited to solicitation of funds or distribution of literature mail or at alternate locations such as houses of worship shopping areas and special events  the sale andor distribution of newspapers delivery vending machines and retail stores  and the sale of items of all kinds at retail stores

therefore the city of north miami beach florida does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of north miami beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended lifespan  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life health and to eliminate or minimize property damage  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by

is essential to the health or safety of the city residents c measurement of levelofservice capacities the miamidade county concurrency information center and miamidade county administrative order #485 july 1989 may be used as sources of facility capacities more specifically 1 water and wastewater measurement of the water capacity will be based on the design capacities of both the lines serving the property and the potable water supply system city sewer capacity will be measured by the city treatment system capacity water demand and sewage generation rates will be based upon the city impact fee tables tables i and ii at the end of this article or an alternative method acceptable to the director of utilities 2 roadways the standard for measuring highway capacities shall be the florida dot table of generalized daily levelofservice maximum volumes the measurement of capacity may also be determined by engineering studies the county concurrency information center the countys administrative order cited above or other data provided that analysis techniques are technically sound and acceptable to the director of public works traffic generation shall be based upon the institute of transportation engineers manual the impact shall be presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot 3 solid waste table iii may be used to calculate solid waste generation rates projections are subject to approval by the director of public works 4 drainage measurement of drainage shall be based on assumed runoff rates for example from the south florida water management district or fdot tables subject to approval by the director of public works typically this shall be achieved by a combination of onsite detention and french drains 5 recreation measurement shall be based on data in the city comprehensive plan and the latest city population estimate with any necessary interpretation provided by the director of community development d determination of capacity availability for purposes of these regulations the capacity availability shall be determined by 1 adding together a the total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and b the total design capacity of any new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one 1 or more of the following is shown for water sewer solid waste and drainage 1 the necessary facilities are in place at the time a site plan or plat approval is issued or 2 such approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur or 3 construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of site plan or plat approval or 4 the new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to florida statutes or an agreement or development order pursuant to florida statutes for recreation 1 paragraphs #13 above 2 the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of facilities to be completed within one 1 year of the time the development permit is
