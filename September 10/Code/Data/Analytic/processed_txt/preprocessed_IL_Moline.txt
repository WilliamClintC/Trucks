  not applicable sec 32106computations the following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height 1computation of area of individual signs the area of a sign face which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one 1 face shall be computed by means of the smallest square circle rectangle triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed but not including any supporting framework bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself in determining the sign area for a monumentstyle freestanding sign the sign structure or base shall not be included in the calculation of the sign area 2computation of area of multifaced signs the sign area for a sign with more than one 1 face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point when two 2 identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than fortytwo 42 inches apart the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one 1 of the faces 3computation of height the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of 1 existing grade prior to construction or 2 the newly established grade after construction exclusive of any filling berming mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign in cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoning lot whichever is lower the height limits contained in this ordinance pertain to the sign itself but in no case shall any portion of the structure to which a freestanding sign is attached extend more than two 2 feet higher than the permitted height of the sign 4computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a lot of record the permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a lot of record shall be computed by applying the formula contained in table 321052 maximum total sign area to the lot frontage building frontage or wall area as appropriate for the zoning district in which the lot is located on two 2 or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage however the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lots total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot building or wall area frontage on that street sec

standards shall apply to dynamic display signs and electronic offpremises advertising signs erected after the effective date of this ordinance athe luminance of a sign shall not exceed 5000 nits during daytime hours and 500 nits from dusk until dawn the sign manufacturer vendor or installer shall submit written certification that the sign has been designed or preset to not exceed these luminance levels and that the sign includes security features to limit the end users ability to manipulate the preset luminance levels ba sign shall not exceed the minimum luminance necessary for clear and adequate visibility during any given ambient condition the sign manufacturer shall submit written certification that a sign is equipped with a sensor device so that the luminance of such sign will automatically adjust to ambient light conditions cthe luminance of a dynamic offpremises advertising sign shall not increase ambient light levels by more than 03 footcandles when measured perpendicular to the sign at a distance of 250 feet furthermore when adjacent to a residential district illuminance shall not exceed one footcandle when measured at any boundary line with an adjoining property dthe sign installer shall file with the city complete contact information for the sign manufacturer vendorinstaller property owner and tenant as applicable 5any illuminated sign shall not create such intensity or brilliance that impairs vision conflicts with an official traffic sign or device or causes unusual distraction which may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle

manhole must be constructed and approved according to city standards jiepa requirements 1iepa construction permit  if the potential user is required to install pretreatment equipment to control the pollutants in the erw discharged then the potential user would have to contact the illinois environmental protection agency division of water pollution control iepa dwpc concerning the need for a construction permit for the potential pretreatment system the iepa dwpc permit section would make the determination as to whether an iepa construction permit would be necessary 2iepa connection permit  the potential users will have to obtain a connection permit if 1 the erw will be hauled to the potws or 2 if the user is not already connected to the sanitary sewer or 3 is already connected to the sanitary sewer but the proposed erw is substantially different than the normal process wastewater discharged to obtain an iepa dwpc connection permit the potential user must fill out the appropriate iepa dwpc forms 3operator class k license  if a pretreatment system is constructed the iepa may require a certified class k operator for the pretreatment system the iepa operator certification unit

prohibitions in a2 of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in a3c a3u excluding 343401a3h of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permits and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements cbypass 1for the purposes of this section abypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility bsevere property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 35 of this section 3if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior

actions verbal telephone notices letters of violation site visits administrative orders enforcement compliance schedules and administrative fines are administered by the director of public works or in some cases delegated to other personnel enforcement actions which require legal action are made by the director of public works with review and recommendations by the city attorney of the city of moline violations and discrepancies that have been identified during the review process are to be evaluated as to the type of enforcement response necessary by the director of public works in order to ensure equitable treatment of violators and provide a stronger basis for selection of appropriate responses to violations the following enforcement response guide erg should normally be followed unless mitigating circumstances can be shown the erg indicates the type of noncompliance the circumstances which might vary the type of response and the range of responses for that particular category of noncompliance the erg has been developed with the intention of serving the following three main purposes 1it recommends enforcement responses that are appropriate in relation to the nature and severity of the violation and the overall degree of noncompliance  2it provides a guide to encourage a uniform application of enforcement responses to comparable levels in types of violations and it can be used as a mechanism to review the appropriateness of the response  and 3it allows the industrial community to realize the importance of the pretreatment program along with proper operation of equipment and meeting standards and limits along with responses by the wpc division if and when various violations occur babbreviations and definitions of responses the following abbreviations and definitions in order of severity when used in this section shall have the designated meanings vtnverbal telephone notice  is meant to describe a response to a very minor type of violation which is normally conveyed verbally to the contact person at the industry and no further followup is expected this is utilized when there is a very minor infraction such as a report being received one or two days late svsite visit  a visit to the industrial site to discuss and observe the problem this can be a substitution for vtn or nov the sv can also be made in conjunction with a written nov the sv also can require a response within ten 10 days indicating a reason for the noncompliance and what steps are being taken to eliminate any future violations of this nature novnotice of violation  is the most widely used and is a written notification to the industrial user indicating the type of apparent violation and requesting a response within ten 10 days indicating a reason for the noncompliance and what steps are being taken to eliminate any future violations of this nature coconsent order  a consent order would be in such cases where the wpc division believed the industrial user was committed to providing necessary corrective measures to correct previous violations and would utilize the consent order to outline minor compliance schedules along with other conditions that might be required such as additional monitoring more reporting etc the order would normally contain a short time frame of above one 1 month to six 6 months schshow cause hearing  is a meeting to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting the proposed enforcement action the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken the notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail return receipt requested at least five 5 working days prior to the hearing such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user whether or not the use appears as ordered immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date a show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user comcompliance order  this is a formal enforcement compliance order signed by both the wpc division and the industry involved this control mechanism is used when serious or long term violations of discharge limits occur that require the design and installation of new or additional pretreatment equipment usually the timeframe will be six 6 months to one 1 year violations of the com can result in the next step consisting of administrative penalties apadministrative penalties  an administrative penalty would be in such cases where all lower types of enforcement responses have failed andor where deemed appropriate by the director of public works because of the nature andor intent of the violation the next response step is court action the administrative penalties step exists to try to prevent court activity and yet to correct the problem and or show the seriousness of the problem to the industry involved the maximum fine is seven hundred fifty dollars $75000 per violation with each day being considered a separate violation the administrative fine may also be part of a co consent order andor a com compliance order litlitigation  litigation is utilized to define several courses of action including civil suits for injunctive relief andor civil penalties criminal suits termination of service etc these types of actions would all involve the courts the city attorney and would follow the procedures necessary for due process cutilizing response guide a screening process for identifying likelihood of violations will be conducted by the city within five 5 days of receiving information criteria for screening includes categorical and local limits prohibited discharges and potential violation items with corresponding range of responses listed in eh utilizing the enforcement response guide the pretreatment coordinator will initiate the appropriate response and see that the files have been updated to show the type of action being taken and the response date if one 1 is so indicated and the type of action taken the pretreatment coordinator will initiate any field sampling which he feels appropriate to substantiate previous data received or to double check the response of an industrial user to the action which they have indicated that they have taken at the end of each six 6 month period the pretreatment coordinator will be responsible for reviewing the industry files to determine any sncs and if so the pretreatment coordinator shall be responsible for seeing that the sncs are tabulated on an annual basis and that the name of all sncs are published in the local daily newspaper regular surveillance sampling and unannounced inspections to detect incidence of noncompliance not revealed by report submittals will be conducted by the city these include unannounced annual inspections of all ius to confirm iu classification waiver conditions and compliance to pretreatment program regulations dsignificant noncompliance instances of significant noncompliance snc are industrial user

gross density requirement nonresidential and nonparkrecreation uses are limited to those that typically require large expanses of land but have minimal impacts on natural features and resources and which are not subject to damage from periodic flooding and other natural occurrences on individual lots buildings and site improvements typically are clustered in order to protect the natural features

density and intensity regulations sec 353600purpose the purpose of this division is to assist developers in determining the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development rationale this division regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this division is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of moline comprehensive plan many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for minimum flexibility andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this division relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum green space ratios gsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area rations fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives sec 353601how to use this division this division contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this division to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by this division should be reviewed this division recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners all developerspersons seeking development permits are encouraged to complete the worksheets and follow the steps contained herein however the requirement to complete the worksheets shall apply only to applications for certain types of development permits as established as part of the administrative policies of the city a copy which may be obtained from the zoning administrator sec 353602natural resources site evaluation apurpose an important goal of the city of moline comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include shorelands wetlands drainageways steep slopes and woodlands these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water ground water and soil quality  habitat provisions and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects bmitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed site development standards and

permitted on the site  the maximum gross density mgd identified in step 5 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step 3 above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this chapter inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site gstep 7  check the minimum permitted lot area  the minimum lot area mla requirement given in the zoning district identified in step 2 above is the smallest size lot permitted within the zoning district the mla must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in step 4 above if the mla given in the zoning district is larger than the lot size requirement

minimum lot area requirement against the gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum lot area mla given for the applicable zoning district identified in table 3533011 should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step 3 above if the gsa is less than the mla required by the zoning district then additional property should be acquired fstep 6  check minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the required resource protection area present on the subject property  the required landscape surface ratio lsr given for the applicable zoning district identified in table 3533011 should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step 5 above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step 3 above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required then more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site gstep 7  determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site  the maximum floor area ratio far given for

council specifically finds provide sufficient community benefit to offset the proposed deviation sec 353704pud types provides the procedures and review criteria for all puds these apply to the following types of planned unit developments 1planned unit development district under a planned unit development district a comprehensive set of development standards are approved that apply to a lot or a subdivision as opposed to a specific site plan showing building footprints in addition to including comparable standards to the default district the pud district also includes standards for perimeter landscaping and buffering vehicular and pedestrian circulation and other standards as necessary to ensure that future development will be of an intensity and quality as represented by the applicant and envisioned by the city council typically planned unit development districts are approved for larger developments greater than five acres which include several different types of uses that are expected to be built over a long period of time 2planned unit development site  under a planned unit development site a detailed site plan showing building footprints setbacks parking areas and other details is approved with which all future development must comply at the time of planned unit development approval standards for future building additions or minor modifications may be included but generally the approved site plan controls all development on the lot indefinitely typically planned unit development sites are approved for smaller developments which include a small number of buildings that are expected to be built shortly after pud approval sec 353705pud stages the two pud types described in above may be approved in the following three stages 1outline development plan an outline development plan odp is an optional but encouraged first step prior to an application for a preliminary development plan for a parcel of at least 20 acres the purpose of an

development prior to the approval of a preliminary plan at odp the proposed zoning for the entire property or for each pod designated for development on the plan is established this step is recommended for larger more diverse projects that are expected to be developed over a long period of time through this process the general pattern of development is established with a range of densities and intensities assigned to individual pods that will be the subject of future more detailed planning acontrolling document  all subsequent preliminary and final plans and all future

division 1 natural resources protection standards sec 354100purpose the purpose of this division is to set forth the requirements for the mandatory protection of natural resources and permanently protected green space areas within the jurisdiction of this in part the provisions of this division are designed to ensure the implementation of the adopted moline comprehensive plan sec 354101how to use this division this division contains the standards which govern the protection disturbance and mitigation of disruption of all natural resource and other permanently protected green space areas the provisions of this division are intended to supplement those of the city of moline rock island county the state of illinois and the federal government of the united states which pertain to natural resource protection this division recognizes the important and diverse benefits which natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type and is designed to accomplish several objectives 1first a definition of the natural resource is provided 2second the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural resource type are provided 3third the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given 4fourth mandatory protection requirements are identified 5fifth where permitted mitigation standards are provided sec 354102natural resource protection standards acompliance all new development including building construction other site improvements andor site preparation additions to existing development including building construction other site improvements andor site preparation along with all new subdivision plats condominiums and site plans in all zoning districts shall comply with the resource protection standards set forth in table 3541021 bnatural resources to remain undisturbed  all of the natural resources required to be protected under this division shall remain undisturbed and in a natural state except those natural resources where mitigation is permitted and where that mitigation is in strict accord with those requirements set forth in this division cdestruction of existing natural resources removal of protected natural resources as defined in this division from a property before any development approvals from the city are sought shall not be allowed unless the property owner obtains a site plan approval and meets the standards of this division for natural resource preservation all clear cutting and destruction of natural resource features shall 1require a site plan review and approval as per shall be in compliance with the provisions of this division 2be required to meet the protection levels described in this division 3where such clear cutting andor destruction violations occur be required to meet the mitigation standards set forth

share a common boundary even if they are divided by a public road or navigable waterway or if they connect at only one point dwhether mitigation is permitted shall be determined by the zoning administrator on a casebycase basis based on the findings of the field survey conducted in accordance with c eif not otherwise restricted by state or federal regulations the zoning administrator may allow the filling or alteration of up to one acre of wetland without mitigation if such filling or alteration is essential for public safety purposes as defined under state law sec 354103natural resource measurement anatural resources measurement all land area within a proposed development site plan subdivision plat or condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in this division shall be accurately measured by the petitioner the total square feet and acreage of each natural resource feature shall be multiplied by its respective natural resource protection standard as set forth in table 3541021 to determine the amount of each natural resource feature to be protected by a conservation easement if two or more natural resource features are present on the same area of land only the most restrictive natural resource protection standard shall be used sec 354104natural resource features mitigation aintent of mitigation the city of moline recognizes that property owners subdividers or condominium developers may wish to develop in portions of those protected natural resource feature areas shown as eligible for mitigation in table 3541021 provisions in this division set forth the conditions for mitigation and mitigation standards for the various natural resource features for which mitigation is allowed under the provisions of table 3541021 the intent of these provisions is not to permit greater destruction of natural resource features than is permitted under the requirements of this division for a typical property or development this division sets specific standards for use when the extent of the natural resources on a site and the use of the regulations would create a major hardship for said natural resource feature protection thus mitigation is intended to be used instead of a variance request when severe hardships would result from the strict enforcement of the natural resource protection standards and requirements set forth in this division boffsite mitigation offsite mitigation may be permitted if such offsite mitigation occurs within the same watershed as the natural resource feature or property being mitigated and follows the methods requirements standards andor criteria set forth under this division all permitted offsite mitigation shall occur within the corporate limits of the city of moline sec 354105steep slopes adefinition   three categories of steep slopes are defined herein for use in this these categories are based upon the relative degree of the steepness of the slope as follows 1slopes of 20% to 30% inclusive 2slopes greater than 30% 3no land shall be considered a steep slope unless the steep slope area has at least a 20% vertical drop and has a minimum area of 5000 square feet bpurpose  steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption primarily related to soil erosion such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil results in exacerbated erosion downhill and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways wetlands streams ponds and lakes beyond adversely affecting the environmental functions of these resource areas such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in affected areas beyond these threats to the public safety disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumping  unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties buildings and public facilities such as roads and utilities cdetermination of presence   steep slopes are to be determined by using the following sources andor methods in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used 1a topographic survey prepared by and certified by an illinois registered land surveyor at the petitioners expense at a contour interval of not less than 2 feet 2topographic maps on file with the city of moline 3usgs 75minute topographic quadrangle maps the area of steep slopes in square feet or acres shall be measured and graphically delineated on a topographic drawing and on the natural resource protection plan such steep slope drawing shall graphically indicate those steep slope areas by slope type of the property pursuant to the steep slope definition set forth in this dprotection standards steep slope areas shall be retained to the extent shown on table 3541021 protected portions of steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of sec 354106woodlands and forest adefinition 1woodlands young  an area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of onehalf acre or more and at least 50% of which is composed of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of at least three inches however no trees grown for commercial purposes shall be considered a young woodland 2woodlands mature  an area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of one acre or more and at least 50% of which is composed of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of at least 10 inches  or any grove consisting of eight or more individual trees having a dbh of at least 12 inches whose combined canopies cover at least 50% of the area encompassed by the grove however no trees grown for commercial purposes should be considered a mature woodland 3woodlands include all tree species listed as large deciduous trees and evergreen trees as listed in appendix a bpurpose woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions these include atmospheric benefits such as removing airborne pollutants carbon dioxide uptake oxygen production and evapotranspiration returns water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers greatly reducing runoffrelated soil erosion woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion finally under proper management techniques woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources cdetermination of presence 1the determination of woodland and forest boundaries shall be determined by using the following sources andor methods in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used aa field

section in cases where the drip line or canopy areas overlap the areas of overlap shall only be counted once in cases where drip line or canopy areas overlap property lines the property lines are to be used as the boundary for the woodland or forest area with only that portion of the drip line area located on the subject property counted toward the woodland or forest area the location size and summary of species types of all healthy trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of 10 inches or greater that are located in woodland and forest areas within 25 feet of any proposed improvement andor in woodland and forest areas to be demolished due to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically shown on the natural resource protection plan or submitted as a separate drawing for the remaining undisturbed areas of the site whether they are mature or young woodlands is required the natural resource protection plan shall include an estimate of the percentage of all healthy trees within each woodland or forest area that have a diameter breast height dbh 10 inches or greater dprotection standards woodland areas shall be retained to the extent shown on table 3541021 protected portions of woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of emitigation woodlands and forest areas may be mitigated under either of the following two alternative requirements applicable to the mitigation of woodland and forest areas except that the zoning administrator may approve different sizes and types of plantings

354107drainageways adefinition a course of running water either perennial or intermittent flowing in a channel bpurpose drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement cdetermination of presence drainageways are to be determined by using the definition of drainageway as set forth in division 2 of of this ordinance and the sources in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used 1a topographic survey prepared at the petitioners expense by and certified by an illinois registered land

the ordinary high water mark of all ponds streams lakes wetlands and navigable high water mark of all rivers bpurpose shore buffers serve to protect landwater margins from erosion due to site disruption because of regular contact with wave action currents and runoff such areas are highly susceptible to continuous and in some cases rapid erosion shore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy and filters significant amounts of waterborne pollutants and sediments shore buffers also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin cdetermination of presence shore buffers are to be determined as the land within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of all navigable waters and parallel to that ordinary highwater mark where required navigable waters are to be determined by using the definition of navigable water set forth in division 2 of the sources in
