establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  1711 hereof this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  1711 storm sewers  1712   1713 statutory authority in

changes including changes in lifestyles which have occurred since the time that most homes in ardsley were built have created a demand for significantly larger new homes as well as the teardown and redevelopment andor major expansion of existing homes the village board hereby finds that the scale of these new or expanded homes has in some cases been out of character and scale with the neighborhoods in which they are located similarly a combination of larger houses and increased land utilization for uses and structures accessory to such homes has caused excessive disturbance of the land increased stormwater runoff and resulted in a reduction in green space ie trees and other forms of vegetation such intensive development and increased stormwater runoff results in increased downstream flooding erosion and sedimentation as well as impacting the aesthetically pleasing parklike character of the villages established neighborhoods it is therefore the intent of the village

by their very nature have serious objectionable characteristics which can have a significant impact on the neighborhood and community in which they are located the board of trustees further finds that the uncontrolled proliferation of such uses would be inconsistent with the nature of the village as a primarily residential familyoriented community  such uses can contribute to the blighting or downgrading of neighborhoods in which they are located as a result of their related potential for an increase in crime and the undermining of the economic moral and social welfare of the community

children reside or may regularly assemble is of great concern to the village of ardsley therefore it is the purpose of this section to prevent a concentration of these uses in any one area and to specifically reduce their potential accessibility to children a the remaining contiguous property of such owner or owners shall not be deemed nonconforming in any respect whatsoever merely by virtue of such dedication  b the owner or owners and their successors in title shall be entitled in applying the provisions of  andor  2009   andor  20017   andor  20025 to have the same applied as if the

of the village of ardsley hereby finds and declares it to be the public policy of the village of ardsley to preserve its wetlands including water bodies and watercourses its steep slopes and its trees so as to protect both the environment and the aesthetic character of the village the following specific purposes and findings are related to each of these areas of environmental concern a wetlands 1 population growth has produced increasing demands upon the villages land and natural resources the resulting development is encroaching upon despoiling polluting andor eliminating some of the villages wetlands water bodies watercourses and other natural resources including the natural processes associated therewith the village board finds that it is necessary to preserve protect and conserve ardsleys wetlands including water bodies and watercourses so as to prevent their despoliation and destruction and to regulate the use and development thereof the preservation and maintenance of such natural features in an undisturbed condition is important for physical ecological social aesthetic recreational and economic reasons related to promoting the health safety and general welfare of present and future residents of the village and of downstream drainage areas in particular wetlands serve multiple functions including but not limited to the following a protecting water resources by providing sources of surface water recharging groundwater and aquifers serving as chemical and biological oxidation basins and functioning as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation b controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or regulating natural flows c providing nesting migratory and wintering habitats for diverse wildlife species including many on the new york state and federal endangered species lists d supporting vegetative associations specifically adapted for survival in lowoxygen environments e providing areas of unusually high plant productivity which support significant wildlife diversity and abundance f providing breeding and spawning grounds nursery habitat and food for various species of fish  20092 visual obstructions  20092  g serving as nutrient traps for nitrogen and phosphorus and filters for surface water pollutants h helping to maintain biospheric stability by supporting particularly efficient photosynthesizers capable of producing significant amounts of oxygen and supporting bacteria that process excess nitrates and nitrogenous pollutants and return them to the atmosphere as inert nitrogen gas i providing open space and visual relief from development j serving as outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for the study and appreciation of natural history ecology and biology 2 some of these important natural resources have been lost or their function impaired by having been drained dredged filled excavated built upon or polluted or by other actions which are inconsistent with their proper protection remaining wetlands water bodies and watercourses are in similar jeopardy it is the intent of this article to promote the public purposes identified in this section by providing for the protection

watercourses and other related features of the terrain  and by providing and protecting appropriate habitats for natural wildlife the avoidance or minimization of development on wetlands or wetland buffers will also require appropriate adjustment of development density to achieve the stated purpose b steep slopes 1 population growth and increased land values have resulted in the development of steep slope areas which were once considered to be unbuildable or prohibitively expensive to develop the village board hereby finds that it is necessary to preserve protect and conserve ardsleys steep slope areas so as to prevent their unnecessary and improper disturbance with the resultant impact which that may have upon the public health safety and general welfare the preservation of such areas in an undisturbed condition is important for physical ecological social aesthetic recreational and economic reasons related to promoting and protecting the health safety and general welfare of present and future residents of the village and surrounding areas the village board finds that it is particularly important to preserve steep slopes for the following reasons among others a the improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can cause erosion and sedimentation to occur at rates in excess of those  20092 ardsley code  20092  experienced under normal conditions erosion and sedimentation often includes the loss of topsoil a valuable natural resource and can result in the disturbance of natural habitats the degradation of the quality of surface water the alteration of drainage patterns the gullying of land the obstruction of drainage structures and the intensification of flooding both on and off the subject site b the inadequately or uncontrolled disturbance of steep slopes can lead to the failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth which creates safety concerns for persons wildlife and manmade structures c sleep slopes including vegetation and rock outcroppings located thereon contribute to the attractive visual character of the village and surrounding areas since such slopes are more highly visible from roadways and neighboring properties than are more level lands 2 regulation of development on steep slopes can eliminate or at least minimize the degradation of these important environmental features while still allowing the reasonable use of private property this can be done by encouraging flexible development design which seeks to avoid the disturbance of steep slopes or where that is impractical requires that any such disturbance be conducted in accordance with acceptable engineering practices the avoidance or minimization of development on steep slope areas will also require appropriate adjustment of development density to achieve the stated purpose c trees population growth and changing lifestyles have resulted in increasing demands for the clearance of trees to provide space for various forms of human activity including roadways driveways parking areas buildings patios decks swimming pools and other such uses the village board hereby finds that the preservation of trees is necessary to protect the health safety and general welfare of the village because trees provide shade impede soil erosion aid water absorption and water retention in the soil inhibit excess runoff and flooding enhance air quality offer a natural barrier to noise and glare provide a natural habitat for wildlife provide screening enhance property values and add to the general aesthetic quality of ardsley in particular trees benefit the community in the following specific ways among others 1 by providing shade and cooling the air ground and buildings 2 by reducing wind thereby resulting in greater energy efficiency for the heating of buildings during winter 3 by reducing noise levels and glare 4 by reducing soil erosion especially on slopes  20092 visual obstructions  20092   20093 regulations the regulations established in this
