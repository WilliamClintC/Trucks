building and housing s note the arrangement and numbering of the city component codes chapters articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes chapters and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the city the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the city indicates whether a given ordinance was

a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in a or the specific prohibitions in b3 18 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass through or interference and that either 1a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference  or 2no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the board was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with

offpremise and billboard sign regulations the city recognizes that billboards are by their nature different in scope and purpose from other types of signage in the city billboards are significantly larger in size than other types of signage allowed in the city and their principal purpose is to dramatically attract the attention of the travelling public the potential impact of a billboard on adjacent areas is significantly greater than other types of signage advancements in technology and efficiencies enable signs to change static message or copy electronically eg utilizing an led or digital type of sign these newer technologies exacerbate the potential impact of a billboard in terms of adversely dominating the environment in which they operate due to light spillover and light pollution unless regulated in a reasonable fashion the intent of this section is to establish standards and regulations for billboards including addressing those utilizing these newer technologies in order to minimize the secondary effects that can accompany the unregulated display of these types of signs  preserve the character and repose of adjacent areas with a principal focus on residential

interpretations to the board of zoning appeals where in the opinion of the planning director the proposed use is not sufficiently similar to a use expressly listed as a permitted or conditional use on the permitted land use table  to allow staff interpretation b purpose the interpretation authority established by this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this zoning though detailed and extensive cannot as a practical matter address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied in particular certain categories of uses are listed as either conditional or permitted uses but certain specific proposed uses may not clearly fall within the common meaning of any of the listed uses many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this zoning light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority an interpretation shall not have the effect of adding to or changing the essential content of this zoning but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases c parties entitled to seek interpretations applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation provided that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion dprocedure 1 application applications for interpretations of this zoning be filed on a form provided by the planning department and shall contain information describing the nature of

unless such use is substantially similar to other uses specifically listed as permitted or conditional in such district and is more similar to such uses than to other uses listed as permitted or conditional in another zoning district 4 if the proposed use is most similar to a use allowed only as a conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located then any use interpretation authorizing such use shall be subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to of this zoning 5 no use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in question unless such use meets the standards of subsections e3 and 4 hereof f effect of favorable use interpretations use interpretations shall only authorize a use in a specific district and shall not allow the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure use interpretations shall merely authorize the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the city including but not limited to a building permit a certificate of occupancy subdivision approval and site plan approval g limitations on favorable use interpretations 1 a use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or allowed as a conditional use in a particular district shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it is issued and such interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has not been issued 2 once a use interpretation is made for a particular use in a particular district that use shall be permitted as a conditional use for the entire district and shall be available for other property owners in that district conditional use process h appeals from planning director decisions the board of zoning appeals shall

the comprehensive plan if the amendment is inconsistent then city council with the advice of the planning commission must find that there have been major changes of an economic physical or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated when the comprehensive plan was adopted and those changes have substantially altered the basic characteristics of the area d zoning map amendments ie rezonings often become issues of significant contention between applicants and residents living adjacent to and in the vicinity of the property to be rezoned too often this results in difficult and argumentative public hearings before the municipal planning commission and city council in most cases opposition to a rezoning request is based on legitimate concerns over the wellbeing and preservation of a neighborhood but sometimes opposition results from a simple lack of communication and understanding between the applicant and the neighborhood residents the city therefore strongly advises any person that is considering applying for a zoning map amendment ie rezoning to discuss the proposal with residents living within 200 feet of the property to be rezoned and with the leadership of any organized neighborhood organizations that represent the area before making application to the planning department the department can assist by providing contact information for

forms prescribed by the planning department and follow established submittal deadlines bmajor development projects often become issues of significant contention between applicants and residents living adjacent to and in the vicinity of the property to be rezoned too often this results in difficult and argumentative public hearings before the municipal planning commission and city council in most cases opposition to a rezoning request is based on legitimate concerns over the wellbeing and preservation of a neighborhood but sometimes opposition results from a simple lack of communication and understanding between the applicant and the neighborhood residents the city therefore strongly advises any person that is considering applying for a development of significant impact dsi to discuss the proposal with residents living within 200 feet of the property to be rezoned and with the leadership of any organized neighborhood organizations that represent the area before making application to the planning department the department can assist by providing contact information for individuals who should be consulted call site plans for development in the b4 district also shall be submitted
