regulations 1 statutory authorization finding of fact purpose and objectives statutory authorization the legislature of the state of connecticut has in of the general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the planning and zoning commission of the town of plymouth does hereby promulgate the following i the flood hazard areas of the town of plymouth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 38 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages ii it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion hazards or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands iii the objectives of these regulations are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and g to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 39 2 general provisions these regulations shall

regulations all provisions shall be a considered as minimum requirements  b liberally construed in favor of the governing body and  c deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes  vi the degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes these regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage these regulations shall not create liability on the part of the town or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
