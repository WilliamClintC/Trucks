rightsofway the city strives to keep its rightsofway in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rightsofway a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rightsofway is their frequent excavation by persons whose equipment is located therein 2 rightofway obstruction is a source

equipment in the rightofway and charging the citizens of the city for goods and services delivered thereby are using this public property for private gain and profit 4 the state legislature has recognized that it is in the publics interest that the use and regulation of rightsofway be carried on in a fair efficient competitively neutral and substantially uniform manner while recognizing such regulation must reflect distinct engineering construction operation maintenance and public and worker safety requirements and standards applicable to various users of rightsofway further the legislature has determined that because increasing numbers of persons may seek usage of rightsofway municipalities such as the city must be and have been authorized to regulate use of rightsofway consistent with this mandate the city has endeavored to model its rightofway standards and regulations of general applicability 5 in response to the foregoing the city enacts this article relating to rightofway permits and management together with an ordinance making necessary revisions to other this article imposes fair efficient competitively neutral uniform and reasonable regulations on the

transitoriented and mixeduse development the cor district envisions a distinctly different development pattern with a more urban structure of streets and blocks than the suburban and rural patterns that have shaped the community to date the cor area is comprised of a number of distinct subdistricts intended to define the type and intensity of uses location of amenities and overall character of development the cor district incorporates the cor development plan and development framework by reference to provide necessary building and site design features that are essential to a pedestrian environment b the cor subdistrict definition the cor district consists of five subdistricts that define the type and intensity of land use 1 cor1 mixeduse core subdistrict the mixeduse core is intended to provide a mix of residential retail service professional community service recreational and similar uses on every block near and within easy walking distance of the transit station the broadest variety and highest intensity of uses including high density housing and lodging facilities are encouraged near the station verticallyintegrated mixed use projects with retail restaurant and service uses especially at corner locations are strongly encouraged this district incorporates the highest architectural and design standards to encourage pedestrian mobility and street activity the majority of the uses within this district will rely on parking structures to accommodate the parking needs of customers and employees in order to contribute to an active pedestrian environment each block within the cor1 subdistrict shall include at least two of the following uses commercial office civic andor residential use 2 cor2 cor2 and 2b commercial subdistrict the cor2 commercial subdistrict is designated to provide a location for retail commercial that has building andor site designs inconsistent with the cor1 subdistrict including larger scale retail and other autooriented commercial uses such uses tend to benefit from direct highway access and good visibility and may have market areas that extend beyond the community these commercial and autooriented uses shall be clustered in compact identifiable areas and not present the look of typical strip suburban development buildings shall be designed with a pedestrian orientation and relationship to the primary street that is compatible with the adjacent cor1 subdistrict the cor2 subdistrict is further defined by a cor2b subdistrict that allows for additional flexibility in allowing largerscale retail that is intended to anchor the development and support the mixeduses within the development 3 cor3 and cor3a workplace subdistrict the workplace area is intended to accommodate medical and technologyrelated office and research uses as well as other office uses and ancillary retail and service uses designed to support serve employees and office visitors uses with high concentrations of employees are most desirable the cor3 subdistrict is further defined by a cor3a subdistrict that allows exclusively schools due to the unique design and site layout needs of a school different standards are in place in the cor3a subdistrict than other development within the cor3 subdistrict 4 cor4 cor4a cor4b and cor4c neighborhood subdistrict the neighborhood subdistrict is intended to include a full range of housing types from smalllot singlefamily detached to highdensity senior and general apartments as well as a limited number of smallscale retail and office uses at appropriate locations ie at corners neighborhood design incorporates many traditional singlefamily neighborhood features such as alleys carriage houses secondary units front porches and traditional street lighting neighborhoods shall be designed with suitable transitions between different housing types and with wellintegrated open space and natural amenities within walking distance of all homes traditional neighborhood design of streets sidewalks and paths provide easy pedestrian mobility throughout the subdistrict protection of natural areas and corridors that link the natural environment to everyday life is emphasized in this area the cor4 subdistrict is further defined into three categories according to the residential net density a the cor4a subdistrict is the lowest density area in the cor4 district allowing up to ten dwelling units per acre b the cor4b subdistrict is the medium density area in the cor4 district allowing up to 15 dwelling units per acre this area is located along higher volume roadways within the cor and along its perimeter c the cor4c subdistrict shall provide the highest densities in the cor4 district requiring a minimum of 15 dwelling units per acre this area is adjacent to the mixeduse core 5 cor5 park and open space subdistrict the park and open space subdistrict is intended to preserve environmental features provide amenities and create focal points and community gathering places
