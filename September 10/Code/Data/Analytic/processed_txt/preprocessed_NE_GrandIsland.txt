franchised mcs provider who does not abide by the system construction schedule shall be handled in the manner allowed under either this ordinance or where applicable a franchise agreement 977 system expansion for mcs providers a the councilfranchising authority recognizes that one of its primary purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest diversity of programming sources be available to the greatest number of city residents the councilfranchising authority is also cognizant that an mcs provider may have some constitutionally protected rights with respect to when and what areas of the city are provided service b in order to balance those interests the councilfranchising authority sets the minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part of a franchised mcs provider c a franchised mcs provider shall submit within six 6 months of the effective date of this ordinance a detailed plan for multichannel system expansion to any area not presently served within the city provided however no such plan shall be accepted by the councilfranchising authority as to any area less than the entire city limits if a nonexempt mcs provider has already submitted such a plan as part of a franchise such plan should not be construed as a requirement for universal service but rather as a means for achieving the councilfranchising authoritys goals mentioned in a however at a minimum a franchised mcs provider shall extend multichannel service to any area within the city that has a density of ten 10 homes or building passings per mile or fractional equivalent thereof as measured from the extremity of the system nearest the unserved area also in such a case a newly installed subscriber shall not be assessed or apportioned the cost for installation except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers so long as the system expansion is technically feasible d the detailed plan must include criteria for 1 extending the provision of service to isolated subscribers  2 extending the provision of service to new or existing developments with overhead cable construction  and 3 new or existing developments with underground cable construction e the detailed plan must be reviewed and approved by the councilfranchising authority f for purposes of this isolated subscribers means any potential customer of a franchised mcs provider who dwells in a house more than onehalf 12 mile from the nearest franchised mcs provider connection 978 permits and licenses an mcs provider shall obtain at its own expense all permits and licenses required by law

councilfranchising authoritys policy with respect to safety requirements a the councilfranchising authority requires that the mcs providers construction operation and maintenance of the multichannel system meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multichannel service b consequently the councilfranchising authority requires any nonexempt mcs provider to adopt the following safety requirements 1 emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this ordinance  2 minimum standby power as noted in this ordinance  3 the provision of an indoor signal or safety alert technology in the manner noted in this ordinance  4 implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set forth in this ordinance  5 follow all fcc rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative leakage index cli limits  and 6 comply with and abide by any construction safety or fire codes as noted in this ordinance 987 provisions to alert subscribers in the event of an emergency  standby power a in order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending imminent or actual natural or manmade emergency then all mcs providers shall ensure that the multichannel system providing multichannel service to all or part of the city is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the city to override the audio portion of all channels by touchtone phone or functional equivalent from any location b in addition to any other requirements listed in this an mcs provider shall 1 designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video  2 inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel at least daily on at least one 1 channel of the multichannel system  3 maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the needs of hearing and sightimpaired customers  4 test the emergency override system not less than once a month  5 cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system  and 6 develop a plan with the citys concurrence in order to provide continuity of multichannel service and response to service calls in the event of a natural or manmade emergency c as one method of providing continuity of multichannel services in the event of a natural or manmade emergency an mcs provider shall unless exempted by the councilfranchising authority have the capacity for four 4 hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable and all headends hubs and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable service to and throughout the city 988 provisions concerning safety alert technology a the councilfranchising authority considers the need for an indoor signal or safety alert technology available to both subscribers and nonsubscribers of an mcs providers lowest level of programming service of paramount interest and need and as such should be an integral part of an mcs providers system though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency alert override signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it may be used by both subscribers to basic service and nonsubscribers to the basic service of an mcs providers system moreover such safety alert technology is connected to the national weather service twentyfour 24 hour radio service including its new wrsamesite select weather and warning system which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an audio alert voice path regardless of whether an individual has a television receiver or monitor or an fm receiver and moreover can provide effectively instantaneous alert and warning as well as needed instructions in addition to allowing key communityoriented entities to communicate with both the general populace and selected ie target segments of the community b in realization and recognition of the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider shall offer for use throughout the city within twelve 12 months of the effective date of this ordinance a signal or safety alert monitoring technology for purposes of alerting both subscribers and nonsubscribers of a multichannel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies and allowing the city to communicate with both subscribers and the public as the need to do so may exist at any time c a nonexempt mcs provider shall cooperate with the city and the provider of said technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary onpremises alert receiving devices including the installation and replacement of such as may be needed from time to time d a nonexempt mcs provider shall install the necessary electronics processing and distribution equipment in the mcs providers headend and will ensure the maintenance operating condition and replacement of such equipment as is necessary to protect its continued use e notwithstanding the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider has no responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining in a timely manner replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components f it is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a multichannel system to use the safety alert device and receive the safety alert service so long as a drop is installed into the address to which said device is attached it is also understood that the user need not have a television receiver g the councilfranchising authority recognizes the positive effect on the safety of the public in general and the ability to save lives and property of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious warning or alert possible without such a device and technology consequently the councilfranchising authority requires that all nonexempt mcs providers shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate by the councilfranchising authority in cooperation with the councilfranchising authority and the manufacturer to inform the citizenry and noncable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert technology h an mcs provider shall assure that all subscribers to multichannel service receive printed material fully describing the technology and its benefits at least annually and at the time of installation i an mcs provider shall allow nonsubscribers of basic cable service the choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment which shall include the cost of installation on a nondiscriminatory basis and so inform such persons of both options j given the significant public safety and life and property saving benefits of this technology and the resultant need of as much of the general public as possible to be protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk to life limb and property associated with other alertwarning systems an mcs provider shall assure that the service is placed on the same level of service and is priced commensurate with that for like technologyservice in the midwestern united states k given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss of life and property and the need and ability of the councilfranchising authority to communicate directly with the public in any number of situations including but not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death and as this technology is clearly not a programming service the councilfranchising authority deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such technology as a governmental use of the system and it is the intent of the city that it be made available to all subscribers 989 implementation of a preventative maintenance program a it shall be the duty of an mcs provider that has more than three hundred fifty subscribers to devise and implement a quarterly preventative maintenance program for the multichannel system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multichannel system that would affect the citizens health safety and welfare or negatively affect the quality of multichannel services being provided b before the mcs provider implements such a program it shall be reviewed and approved by the councilfranchising authority within fortyfive 45 days after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program the mcs provider shall prepare and submit a written report to the councilfranchising authority detailing the results of the tests conducted and all items performed or addressed during the quarterly program although not exhaustive the following areas should be included in a preventative maintenance program and subsequent report 1 inspection and repair if needed of the headend  2 inspection and repair if needed of the antenna tower  3 requiring weatherproofing and protection of the antenna lead connectors and on any other exposed fittings  4 requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accordance with fcc requirements  5 removing tree roots limbs and branches that interfere with or come in contact with the mcs providers cable  6 requiring the periodic servicing testing and calibration of the mcs providers equipment including equipment on service vehicles and field test equipment  7 employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or situations in which the multichannel system electronics are operating outside preprogrammed parameters  8 testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function properly during an emergency situation  and 9 testing of the safety alert system or technology 990 construction fire and safety codes a an mcs provider shall construct operate maintain repair remove replace or restore the multichannel system in strict compliance with all current technical codes adopted by the councilfranchising authority the state or the united states b the codes referred to specifically include but are not limited to construction fire and safety and zoning codes 991 reserved 992 reserved 993 reserved 994 reserved 995 reserved 996 alternative user charge a this applicable to any unfranchised but otherwise authorized mcs provider and to any mcs provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional unenforceable or invalid for all franchised mcs providers the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable b where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this ordinance the councilfranchising authority may impose extract and collect a charge from an affected mcs provider for the use by such provider of the streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city c the alternative user charge shall be based on the following mathematical mode 1 determine the present value of all public streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city in which are located multichannel system facilities and equipment of the affected mcs provider  2 take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the city as determined by the property appraiser for the city for the five preceding years  3 take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  4 add the present value to the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  5 divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  6 multiply that figure by five percent 5% to arrive at the annual user charge that is to be collected from the affected mcs provider for purposes of illustration only the formula reads as follows present value   the dollar amount of the property value increase for remaining term of the franchise based on average percentage increase of land appraisals for past years of franchise term  divide the adjusted present value by the remaining years on the term of the franchise  multiply that figure by five percent 5%   equals the annual alternative user charge d the councilfranchising authority adopts such an alternative user charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected mcs providers use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such mcs providers annual gross revenues however an

class to include public facilities facilities limited to specific companies and attended or coinoperated establishments the director shall assess an industrial waste surcharge for each class based on waste strength determinations established by averaging grab or composite samples or both taken from a representative number of establishments in each class and shall apply this surcharge to the water consumption or metered wastewater of the establishment if the establishment is within a larger facility for which water usage is determined from a master meter the director shall determine an estimated volume for the establishment on which the surcharge is applied the director shall then add the appropriate industrial surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each establishment included in one of the classes if an establishment contains operations from more than one of the classes and the director determines that the surcharge for a particular class would not adequately compensate the city for its cost of treatment the director may assess a surcharge based on a proportional average of the class surcharges involved or may require the establishment to be billed under the requirements of 3070 the owner of an establishment classified into one of the classes may elect to have the industrial surcharge billed under 3070 rather than this section by making application to the director and paying the required sampling costs the director may revise the class surcharges in the future to reflect a change in the average strength of the wastes discharged or to reflect a change in the costs to treat these wastes 3076 contract for reserved capacity the director may with the approval of the council enter into a contract with persons discharging industrial

responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of grand island nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3methods used to analyze flood hazards this a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in 36117b1 herein by applying the provisions of this 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4 assure that
