a voluntary act or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing  2 the person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense b when the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c 1 when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2 c1 of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the traffic 3 c1 of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition incorporated into the offense d voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing

result or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature b a person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact c a person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist d a person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the persons conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature a person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist e when the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when

12192017 111105  stormwater management it is the intent of these minimum requirements to provide for the increased stormwater runoff from the development of land so as to minimize the impact on existing and natural drainage systems while the requirements set forth herein will not stop flooding or the damage caused by flooding they do establish a basis for design which will a minimize the damage and inconvenience of floodings  b provide drainage systems which continue to benefit their tributary area over the long term  c minimize the adverse effects of new drainage systems on existing systems  and d minimize the expense of maintaining the drainage facilities within the municipality    drainage policy a the drainage policy control guidelines and criteria do not provide solutions to all drainage problems nor is the engineer restricted to these designs or procedures exclusively although the policies as stated will hold true for most development work the municipality realizes that there may be individual projects involving special or unusual drainage design problems that should be reviewed prior to completing the development master drainage plan exceptions may be granted to the policies and criteria in such cases when engineering studies show justify modifications b experience has shown that most of the more serious flooding situations are created development can lead to ever increasing flooding problems unless wellconceived cooperative stormwater drainage and flood control programs are undertaken throughout the entire watershed for this reason the general policy of powell shall be 1 all information necessary shall be submitted to the municipality to determine if the stormwater rate of runoff should be controlled within the development prior to its release to downstream properties the tributary area and the upstream watersheds should be determined using natural land divides unless manmade alterations are approved by the city engineer as the basis for watershed delineations 2 all stormwater drainage facilities within a development shall be designed to have capacity and depth including sufficient invert elevations to permit future connections to serve that total tributary area at the design storm frequency and based on the rate of single family residential runoff except as noted in subsection 3 below the system for the upstream tributary area must be extended development upstream watersheds should be determined using natural divides unless manmade alternatives are approved by the city engineer as the basis for watershed delineations 3 all proposed development with a runoff rate greater than that which the downstream system has capacity for or will be designed for will be required to control the rate of stormwater discharge 4 all developments having existing controls located downstream from the site will be required to control the flow rate of stormwater discharge to that rate which existed prior to development 5 it is the responsibility of the property owner to not change or alter any drainage course ditch or drainage system on his property that will damage or cause flooding to adjacent upstream or downstream property owners    1 12192017   drainage requirements a purpose these design standards and specifications shall serve as the minimum requirements for the handling of surface water and drainage these procedures and standards shall govern the development of all new or modified drainage systems the development of such drainage systems shall include the conveyance of surface water to an adequate outlet which is capable of carrying the flow the engineers highest design priority shall be to eliminate the possibility of any major loss of property or any loss of life b adequate drainage outlet surface water runoff from a development shall be drained off site to an adequate drainage outlet the location of the outlet shall be approved by the city engineer and may consist of a ditch stream storm sewer or approved detention basin having sufficient capacity to accommodate the surface water runoff in an engineered manner c drainage easement 1 an adequate easement may be required along any tile detention basin drainage way ditch watercourse natural stream manmade stream storm sewer or any other watercourse deemed necessary by either the city engineer or the public service director hereinafter public service director or director which is not already within the street rightofway the easement shall be of sufficient width to allow cleaning widening deepening replacing or other general maintenance of such drainage course 2 when it is necessary to convey stormwater outside the property lines of a proposed improved area in order to discharge into an adequate outlet the developer i shall be responsible to obtain easements andor maintenance agreements in a form and substance satisfactory to the public service director from abutting property owners and ii shall remain responsible for maintenance of such drainage course unless the easements andor maintenance agreements require the abutting property owners to repair and maintain the drainage course satisfactorily 3 any required drainage easements shall be shown on the final plat and the final engineering and construction plan such drainage easements shall be recorded for public use relating to stormwater conveyance with the exception of city maintained publicly accepted storm sewers and appurtenances maintenance of such drainage easements shall be undertaken in the manner set forth in subsection c4 below 4 in addition to any applicable provisions of 03 the public service director is hereby authorized to inspect such drainage easement drainage courses and if the director determines that maintenance is needed the director shall notify the property owner on which the maintenance is required andor any other parties who in the sole determination of the director directly benefit from such easement that such maintenance is required as follows a the director shall cause written notice to be served on the property owner andor any other parties benefiting from the easement notifying such parties that maintenance of the drainage course is necessary and that a contract with a contractor acceptable to the director for such repair and maintenance should be delivered to the director within 14 days of the notice the notice shall be served upon the property owner andor benefited parties at the tax billing address for such premises reflected upon the records of the delaware county auditor service shall be accomplished by any means permitted for service of summons under the ohio rules of civil procedure each property affected by such notice shall also be posted with such notice by the director b in those instances where the address of the owner is unknown it shall be sufficient to publish a notice once a week in a newspaper of general circulation in delaware county ohio setting forth the substance of the notice and time frame for compliance the time frame for compliance shall be no less than 14 days after the publication c if the property owner andor benefiting parties fail to comply with the notice the city shall cause such repairs replacement maintenance and abatement procedures to be implemented as determined appropriate by the director the cost of such repair replacement abatement and other procedures deemed appropriate by the director shall be immediately due and payable to the city in the amounts and in the proportions determined by the director additionally the director may assess an administrative fee as the director deems appropriate against each property owner or benefiting party in an amount not to exceed $50000 per property owner andor benefited party for each instance where a notice is served under this section the cost and administrative fee shall be due and payable within 30 days after the same are assessed d if any fees or costs remain unpaid for a period in excess of 30 days in addition to any other remedy available to the city the city may authorize placement of a lien on the real estate to be certified to the delaware county auditor in the amount assessed together with interest thereon from the date of such certification at the then existing rate for payment of judgments in the state of ohio such interest shall continue on an annualized basis until paid e any owner or benefiting party aggrieved by an actions of the director under this section may take an appeal to the board of zoning appeals within 30 days of the date service of notice of such action upon the property owner andor benefiting party    1 12192017   general design criteria a acceptable methods of calculation the methods of calculation as listed in table a shall be used unless otherwise approved by the city  b design storm 1 refer to noaas atlas 14 point precipitation frequency estimates for rainfall depths for city of powell the appropriate cn factor may be determined by using technical release no 55 scs or its ohio supplement 2 the major storm must be based on a return period of not less than 100 years a return period of 200 years may be required as directed by the city engineer c drainage area determination the drainage area shall be determined from any of the following sources 1 us geological survey quadrangle 75 minute series contour maps 2 municipality of powelltopographic contour maps  3 delaware county auditor gis topographic information  andor 4 actual field investigation d routing path 1 capacity the routing path or the major drainage system is that part of the storm drainage system which carries the runoff which exceeds the capacity of the designed drainage facilities the major drainage system shall have the capacity to carry runoff from a storm with a return period of not less than 100 years without causing significant threat to property or public safety a return period of 200 years may be required if conditions warrant 2 surface routing paths generally it is not economically feasible to size a storm sewer system to collect and convey more than the frequent storm runoff essentially the complete drainage system of an urban area contains two separate drainage elements while the storm sewers are the primary element the storm drainageways must be provided for the emergency flow from more intense storms 3 intent in providing routing paths the intent of planning for the major drainage element or emergency flow is to insure that stormwater runoff in excess of the capacity of the primary drainage system has a route to follow which will not cause a major loss of property or any loss of life it should be remembered that the major drainage system exists even when it is not planned for and whether or not development exists 4 street rightofway paths street rightsofway are a common choice for conveying major drainage flows again such use must be anticipated when the street layout is established side and rear lot lines offer one alternative to the street the problem with this alternative is the possibility of individual property owners encroaching on the major drainage easement rarely is the problem recognized until the infrequent rainstorm occurs and the major system fails to operate properly where the street is designated as the major drainageway the depth of flow shall not exceed 12 inches at the gutter line for local and collector streets and shall not exceed the crown for arterial streets the same maximum depth criteria will apply where a major drainageway crosses the street where a major drainageway is located outside a street rightofway easements shall be provided all major storm routing easements shall be shown on the grading andor drainage plan also include elevation control points at the terminals of elements of the routing paths these are to be proof surveyed for as built conformance 5 multipurpose routing paths in order to protect the integrity of the nonstreet drainage rightsofway the engineer is encouraged to design routing paths for multipurpose functions pedestrian and bicycle paths lend themselves naturally to this application linear parks aligned along the major drainage corridor are also very effective but usually require greater width than would normally be necessary for drainage purposes 6 major storm runoff the major storm runoff is routed drainage system to determine if the combined capacity of the routing path and storm sewer system is sufficient the capacity of the storm sewer system at any given point is assumed to be the same for the major storm as for the five year storm frequency that is storm sewer system will be considered as conveying the flow q of a five year storm with the remainder of the 100year flow rate safely conveyed in the emergency storm route known as the routing path submit calculations showing conveyance of the routing path with details of critical segments such as near building structures    1

prior to recording the final subdivision plat and the acceptance of the final engineering and construction plan no lot sales will be permitted until this is done 2 types of facilities in development and developing urban and suburban areas several means for controlling stormwater runoff could be used this usually involves storing runoff on or below the ground surface the following types of storage facilities are suggested for detention a parking lot storage parking lot storage is surface storage where shallow ponding is designing to flood specifically graded areas of the parking lot controlled release features are incorporated into the surface drainage system of the parking lot parking lot storage is a convenient multiuse structural control method where impervious parking lots are planned design features include small ponding areas with slotted controlled release structures andor pipesize reduction and increased curb heights this method can easily be incorporated into a site development at approximately the same cost as that of a conventional parking lot the major disadvantage is the inconvenience to users during the ponding function this inconvenience can be minimized with proper design consideration clogging of the flow control device and icy conditions during cold weather are maintenance problems parking lot design and construction grades are critical factors for these reasons the functional effectiveness of parking lot storage is questionable this method is intended to control the runoff directly from the parking area and is usually not appropriate for storing large runoff volumes b dry basins or detention basins dry basins are surface storage areas created by constructing a typical excavated or embankment basin there is no normal pool level and a specific controlled release feature is included to control the rate of discharge the detention flow control structure is usually a multistage device and the retention flow control structure is usually a singlestage device dry basins are the most widely used structural method of stormwater management the soil permeability and water storage potential are not as important with dry basins as with wet basins  therefore dry basins have the greatest potential for broad applications they can be utilized in small developments because they can be designed and constructed as small structures dry basins are often less costly than wet ponds because they do not require extensive design and construction considerations they can be designed for multiuse purposes such as recreation and parks c wet ponds or

compilation of standards and guidelines is for the use the historic district commission in approving or disapproving applications for certificates of appropriateness in the historic district overlay district and for the use of residents and owners of property in the city of powell who are contemplating exterior modifications to existing buildings or new construction within the historic district overlay district this work begins by outlining the boundaries of the historic district overlay zone as created in the city of powell zoning first section describes the city of powell and those elements which create its unique character a series of guidelines follow which illustrate appropriate materials and methods for the preservation of existing architecture and new construction in the historic district overlay district these guidelines are based on the existing character of powell and research into construction methods and materials typical of late 19th and early 20th century vernacular midwestern architecture these guidelines are not intended to substitute for expert advice from a qualified architect engineer or contractor the primary purpose of these standards and guidelines is to provide a basis on which to evaluate the appropriateness of proposed modifications or new construction within powells historic district a very important secondary purpose is to educate owners residents and government officials about the character of powell and the means by which to preserve that character the historic district the boundaries of powells historic district overlay district correspond roughly to the original corporation limits of the city the historic district was originally established by resolution number 8740 of the powell city council on  the powell historic district overlay district will be referred to as the historic district throughout this guide history the land upon which the city of powell now stands was part of a 4000 acre land grant given to james parker in 1800 to satisfy warrants for military service the earliest settlers to the area came from connecticut they named the main northsouth street community middlebury street and the settlement came to be known as middlebury in 183 thomas r hall purchased the land around the tiny city hall started a small store at the main crossroads in about 185 and began calling the settlement hall corners at this time residents received their mail by carrier who delivered it on foot or by horseback to the general store for the residents to pick up themselves after a few years of this crude system the town decided to apply for its own post office with the help of judge thomas w powell of delaware ohio a post office was established in the community in 1857 in gratitude middleburyhall corners was renamed powell the columbus and toledo railroad was incorporated in 187 and a few years later tracks were laid on the west side of the city in 187 the town of powell was laid out defined by the intersection of olentangy street powell road and liberty street as it is to this day why preserve powell the city of powell retains much of its small crossroads town atmosphere today but development is beginning to threaten this image as the city of columbus spreads to the north land values in southern delaware county are increasing and the suburbs of columbus are encroaching on the city this growth will bring new business and more visitors to powell the expansion will strengthen the economy but will threaten the very character which makes powell an attractive place to visit and live in the recent past small cities in similar circumstances have been swallowed by surrounding development because they were considered too ordinary or not old enough to be of interest an important part of our history that of everyman has been lost to preserve these small towns powell is one of these small towns which has not been lost the city contains many excellent examples of vernacular midwestern architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries with its small town rural atmosphere still very much intact powell provides an important look into the everyday lives of small town residents at the turn of the century another of the charms of a city like powell is the sense of growth over time which it displays one can read history in these changes through careful planning and supervision of development powell can continue to grow and change to meet the needs of modern living while maintaining its basic character and integrity architectural character powell ohio is a small midwestern town rural in nature narrow streets small simple houses and tree lined streets create the rural charm of powell the historic district consists primarily of two main roads olentangy and liberty streets which intersect at the commercial center a series of smaller residential streets and alleys complete the street pattern farms of varying sizes along with new housing subdivisions surround the historic district the historic building stock of powell is primarily residential with some small commercial buildings clustered around the major intersection and a few industrial buildings lining the railroad tracks existing significant public buildings include the two story brick schoolhouse at 80 south liberty street the odd fellows hall at 5 south liberty street and the old post office at 14 west olentangy street most of the buildings in the city are frame construction finished in wood powell has a few masonry buildings most brick buildings are commercial or public in nature except for a couple of unusual glazed block residences high style buildings are designed according to the dictates of a specific readily identifiable national or international architectural style powells buildings represent rural vernacular versions of several late 19th and early 20th century high styles some city buildings are simple common building forms decorated by elements from one or more historical styles others represent common building types with simple detailing which do not reflect any particular architectural style although they are not ornate high style structures powells buildings exhibit fine craftsmanship and sound historical construction techniques architectural styles and elements italianate characteristics of this style include asymmetrical plans with octagonal bay windows or projections shallow hipped roofs and carved porches ornamentation includes curved carved brackets under roof overhangs and cornices and hood moldings over doors and windows windows are almost always tall and thin in proportion examples of italianate architecture in powell include the odd fellows hall 5 south liberty street with its prominent cornice supported by elaborate brackets  the brick schoolhouse 80 south liberty street with its shallow hipped roof and segmental arched windows  and 38 west olentangy street with its bay window porch with carved brackets and hood molding all of these buildings exhibit the vertical window proportion typical of the italianate style queen anne irregular massing and complex rooflines are the primary characteristics of this style roofs give the overall impression of steepness but often contain sections of varying pitches chimneys are of ten treated as prominent elementsand become part of the roof composition wall surfaces exhibit a variety of textures and colors combining siding patterned shingles and visible rough stone foundations porches bay and oriel windows are used to further enliven the facades windows occur in a variety of shapes and proportions a group of three windows with the center one taller or arched is a common detail other detailing is classical and small in scale the best example of the queen anne style in powell is found at 147 west olentangy street stick style the primary aim of buildings of this style was to promote truthfulness in construction by exposing or representing the structural frame buildings of this style were always wood frame construction and were faced in wood siding or patterned shingles roof eaves project considerably often supported by diagonal braces and framing members are sometimes exposed in gable ends the detailing on 57 case street suggests the roof framing members the overhang is also supported by diagonal bracing and the gable is faced with patterned wood shingles this gable sheltered a porch which has been enclosed the original house is faced in wood siding eastlake the eastlake style is almost purely a style of ornamentation which often appears on buildings otherwise classified as queen anne or stick style ornamentation is a product of the chisel gouge and lathe and has a robust three dimensional character curved brackets are used profusely and many elements bear a marked resemblance to furniture parts posts and balusters resemble table legs while knobs and motifs of circular perforations borrow from the art of cabinetmaking the porch at 15 north liberty street is powells most exhuberant example of eastlake detailing bungalow true bungalows are one story dwellings with the roof space made habitable by dormers or gable windows the term is also used to describe buildings which do their best to look like one story dwellings while actually providing a full height second story host of powells bungalows are actually two story simple in form and detailing and would be considered dormer front types these have a large low pitched roof with the ridge parallel to the street the roof often continues beyond the front wall to shelter a porch in most cases the front and back of the roof slope at different pitches and a dormer usually projects from the center of the front slope two of powells bungalows are located at 120 south liberty street and 71 west olentangy street site considerations the atmosphere of powell is that of a rural small town at the turn of the century the city is not purely urban or suburban in nature but with increased development some of the amenities of the city and its suburbs will become necessary the site guidelines which follow share two primary goals 1 maintain the rural city character of powells historic district 2 the provision of necessary modern conveniences which may not be characteristic of historic powell and use these contemporary improvements as opportunities to enhance and unify the character of the historic district roads and drives access to rear yard parking lots and storage or garage buildings should be from alleys whenever possible if no such access is possible private parking and roads should be designed to require the least amount of surface drives should be the shortest length possible and the minimum width necessary access roads should be located as unobtrusively as possible and landscaping should be planned to soften their impact commercial drives should be paved with asphalt brick concrete or tar and chips as required in the powell zoning or brick is the preferred material for residential drives but asphalt concrete or tar and chips may be acceptable parking parking for residences turned into businesses or newly constructed businesses along olentangy and liberty streets shall be provided at rear yard areas parking areas should be only as large as necessary to provide a reasonable number of parking spaces as determined by applicable code requirements commercial lots should be paved with asphalt brick concrete or tar and chips as required in the powell zoning or brick are preferred materials for residential parking areas but asphalt concrete or tar and chips may be acceptable sidewalks most turn of the century rural towns such as powell would have had boardwalks in commercial areas and gravel or dirt paths in residential areas some type of contemporary all weather path must be provided to allow for increased pedestrian traffic along olentangy street and at the center of the city sidewalks should be provided along olentangy street from the martin perry house on the east to the railroad tracks on the west sidewalks should also be provided in front of the commercial buildings along liberty street near the intersection with olentangy street see map next page for location in front of the commercial buildings at the center of town see map sidewalks should extend to the edge of the street sidewalks in these locations will require curbs and gutters new or salvaged stone curbs or concrete curbs may be used in residential areas of the city sidewalks should be set back from the edge of the road by a strip of grass curbs and gutters may be provided in these areas if necessary to ensure safety or proper storm drainage sidewalks in all areas of the historic district should be concrete curbs and gutters paved roads with curbs and gutters are not historically accurate in cities such as powell with increased traffic in the city asphalt surfaced roads have become necessary curbs and gutters may be required in some locations such as areas where sidewalks extend to the edge of the street where curbs and gutters are necessary curb cuts for handicapped access should be provided as required by state and local codes setbacks most buildings in powell are set back approximately 20 to 40 feet from the road with modest front lawns the exceptions are the commercial buildings at the corner of olentangy and liberty streets which are built right up to 272 their property lines at the sidewalks rear yards are generally long and narrow residential buildings on adjacent lots throughout the city are set approximately 20 feet apart from each other at their sides new construction should follow the setback lines appropriate to its location and purpose lighting one of the charms of rural areas is the complete darkness of nightfall away from the 24 hour light of the city however proper lighting fixtures can increase the safety of powell and may become more necessary as development continues exterior historic lighting district in should the be incandescent and low in wattage entrance lights and individual free standing path lights are acceptable lighting fixtures should be simple victorian or turn of the century in design with round or the commercial buildings along liberty street near the intersection with olentangy street see map next page for location eggshaped globes on metal posts with minimal detailing colonial style coach lights are not appropriate in the historic district these types belong to an earlier historical period and generally belong on coaches free standing pole mounted lamps may be used to light paths or drives these lights should not be taller than the height of the first story of adjacent buildings metal posts should be painted in dark muted colors such as black brown or dark green the more elaborate the shape of the globe the simpler the detailing of the post should be simple globes can be mounted on more detailed posts all pole mounted lights should be individual clusters of lights are not acceptable in the historic district contemporary lights which incorporate simple round or oval globes and modest posts or brackets may be appropriate in the historic district frosted globes should be used in all lights in the historic district as they will provide softer light than clear globes signage and graphics proposed signage should be in harmony with the building to which it is attached size scale material texture color style and location should be appropriate to both the building itself and the purpose of the graphics appropriate signage should convey the name and purpose of the business in a direct manner using small simple letters logos and graphics should be small straightforward and kept to a minimum the following themes are suggested for these elements history of the city of powell history building graphics related to the specific to which the are attached the traditions of a business represented by sign symbols or images from turn of the century rural america internally illuminated signs should not be used in the historic district exterior illumination is discouraged unless it is incandescent very low in wattage and designed as an integral part of the sign wood is the preferred material for signs and all graphics should employ subtle and natural colors such as those outlined in the section on painting and colors building mounted signs signs should not cover or obscure any doors windows or other architectural features on residential scale buildings signs should not be placed higher than the tops of first story openings or the eave line of a one story wing or porch on commercial scale buildings signs may be placed within a sign band above the first floor or at the cornice line if the graphics integrate carefully with the cornice detailing projecting signs these signs may not project more than 2 feet from the face of a building to which they are mounted or 3 feet from a freestanding support to which they are mounted projecting signs may not be more than 15 inches in height or 5 square feet in area a minimum clearance of 8 feet must be maintained where signs project over a public walkway supporting structures for signs should be appropriate to the detailing of the buildings to which they are attached flags and banners permanent banners must follow the same guidelines as other signage and graphics temporary flags and banners which are not specifically prohibited in the powell zoning code or which do not require a zoning permit are not subject to these restrictions proper display of the united states state of ohio or other historical flag is encouraged all flags and banners which project over a public walkway should maintain a minimum clearance of 8 feet free standing signs height should not exceed the first story of adjacent buildings overall size should not exceed 12 square feet supporting structures should be simple in design and in character with the adjacent buildings no more than three ground in the colors may be used in signs as is stated zoning regulations accessory buildings automobile garages storage sheds and other dependent buildings must be located at the rear of the property with entry facing away from major streets although access from an alley is permissible the accessory building should be compatible with the building it serves in massing materials and basic color scheme but it should not be an exact copy of the main building an accessory building should be obviously subservient to the building it is serving this means that it should be smaller in scale and simpler in detail than the main building roof type roof pitch and rhythm of openings should harmonize with those elements of the main building materials should be similar in nature and scale although not necessarily in refinement for example a house with special wood siding and shingles might have a garage with simpler wood siding special attention must be given to the relationship in scale and location between accessory buildings and the buildings they serve fences the preferred treatment for definition of property boundaries within powells historic district is the use of landscape elements such as low hedges corner or edge plantings and lines of trees fencing of entire yards or portions of them is discouraged within the historic district unless it is necessary for the safety of the owners and the community or to meet applicable code requirements these fences should be the minimum height necessary to serve their purpose tall privacy fences should be limited to rear yards these should be constructed of wood and stained in a natural wood color board or boardand board good neighbor fence styles are appropriate where required for privacy or safety small pieces of fence which define corners edges entries or paths are acceptable in front yards especially if they are integrated parts of landscape features front yard fences may not be higher than 3 feet tall front yards in the historic district these fences should be stained in a natural color or painted cream or white all fences in powells historic district should be built out of wood and be simple in design very ornate fences with intricate patterns or overly rustic fences built of hand hewn lumber are not appropriate wire fences are not appropriate in the historic district landscaping street trees should be planted along olentangy street between th east and west boundaries of the city and along liberty street between the north and south boundaries of the city the planting of street trees elsewhere is also encouraged street trees should be planted approximately 25 feet apart and 3 to 4 feet from the sidewalk it is recommended that the trees be planted in the lawn panels between the buildings and the sidewalk trees in this location will be less likely to send roots under a sidewalk a variety of street trees should be planted in order to ensure that the tree line will survive the failure of one species the following species are recommended for their resistance to the stress of traffic common name latin name size comments hedge maple

public views or can be blended into a more native landscape utilitarian kitchen vegetable and herb gardens are encouraged but should be located in a logical place such as the rear or side of the house near the kitchen or rear entry foundation and wall climbing plants such as ivy can damage historic materials such plantings should be kept to a minimum and carefully controlled on existing structures foundation and wall plantings should not endanger or obscure significant architectural features or historic fabric on new construction such plantings should not be used to hide inappropriate material or lack of proper detailing building materials building materials are very important in establishing the historic character of a structure this is especially true in smaller towns such as powell where most buildings exhibit simple detailing and minimal decoration materials can contribute the qualities of texture pattern tone and color to the surfaces of a building texture refers to the tactile qualities of a material such as its relative roughness or smoothness patterns are regularly repeated motifs shapes or forms which often have the effect of texture host patterns and textures are formed by the traditional methods of laying units of construction material such as bricks siding slate or shingles tone refers to the relative darkness or lightness of a material or color such as the varying grays of slate color can be inherent in the material such as red brick or can be applied like paint to siding more specific information on color tone and historic painting schemes can be found in the section on color and painting building materials with their qualities of texture pattern tone and color become character defining features on many of powells simpler buildings foundations the foundation of a building is the masonry substructure upon which a building rests a sound foundation is vital to the structural integrity of a building a foundation has two major enemies settlement and moisture settlement refers to the movement of ground beneath the building when this occurs the foundation responds to the movement and attempts to adjust to the new lay of the land this change in position can cause cracks in the masonry units or mortar joints host buildings settle gradually over the years or soon after they are constructed hairline cracks or cracks which appear old filled with debris are not generally a source of concern new or newly patched cracks in the foundation walls which bow inward daylight between the base of the house and the foundation and cracks around door or window frames are all signs of potential trouble excess water at the foundation can cause innumerable problems ranging from structural failure or flooding due to disintegration of mortar to deterioration of exterior sheathing materials and interior finishes due to rising damp one of the major causes of excess moisture at the foundation is improper drainage of water at the roof all roof surfaces gutters and downspouts should be inspected periodically to make sure that water is draining properly water runoff should not splash against the exterior wall of a building gutters and downspouts should be kept clear of debris and in good condition to avoid this problem inadequate ventilation of basements or crawl spaces and improper grading at the foundation are other major causes of excess moisture all underground spaces should be vented or dehumidified ground should slope away from the foundation to prevent water from pooling against the masonry foundation plantings trees and shrubs planted against a building are not historically correct and can cause serious damage to historic masonry these plants hold moisture in their root systems which can weaken mortar they will rob clay soil of its moisture opening cracks near the foundation in which water may pool and eventually freeze a weakened foundation can threaten the very structure of a building old foundations should be inspected periodically for signs of deterioration appropriate corrective 1995 replacement 292 steps such as repainting of mortar regrading of soil to ensure drainage and ventilation of underground spaces can solve many foundation problems in the case of extreme structural or moisture concerns consult an engineer or architect the foundations of powells buildings are built out of limestone concrete block or glazed block with about 1 to 2 feet exposed above grade the oldest foundations are limestone laid in a random or coursed rubble pattern later limestone was roughly shaped into rectangular blocks but maintained its natural or rock face manufactured masonry units began to be used at the turn of the century glazed clay tile blocks and a rock faced cast concrete block became popular foundation materials then in situations where a foundation must be entirely rebuilt or in cases of new construction the new foundation should be compatible with city foundation construction techniques in the case of additions new foundations should be as compatible with the existing ones as possible new foundations may be built entirely out of limestone in a random rubble or coursed pattern although cast rock faced concrete block and glazed clay tile blocks are no longer available commercially these materials may be used if they can be found an acceptable alternative to powells traditional foundations uses regular concrete block faced above grade with rubble or coursed limestone another alternative is to lay regular concrete block below ground and split face concrete block which has a rough rocklike surface above grade in general exposed regular concrete block is not an appropriate material for newly constructed foundations in some cases such as an addition to a building with a glazed block foundation it may be the most compatible material available in these special cases regular concrete block may be an acceptable material for foundations in new construction masonry brick there are a few buildings in powell which are built entirely out of masonry brick is used primarily for commercial and public buildings older 19th century bricks are soft and porous due to impurities in the clay from which they are made and variations in firing temperatures later turn of the century bricks are harder more dense and sometimes given special texture by wire cutting brick walls in powell are simple in pattern with the bricks laid either in common or running bonds glazed block glazed block is another type of masonry used on the exterior walls of a few of powells residences and the foundations of many others glazed block is a type of hollow clay tile which was produced in the appalachian regions of southern ohio and west virginia the blocks were manufactured out of the clay soil prevalent in those areas and were mass produced from the 1870s to the 1930s the blocks were fired with a salt glaze which made them durable impervious to water and suitable for exterior use the finished blocks range in color from a dark red to almost black existing masonry although masonry materials are durable and relatively maintenance free they can be damaged by neglect or improper treatment existing masonry walls should be inspected periodically for structural problems or failure of mortar joints spalling splitting off of small fragments from the face of masonry units efflorescence white powder stains resulting from salt deposits broken lintels and bulging or bowed walls can all indicate serious trouble the advice of an expert should be sought if any of these problems are detected repointing mortar is a cushion which gives a masonry wall the ability to expand or contract with temperature extremes or changing soil conditions the mortar must be softer than the masonry units which it cushions in order to perform properly the oldest bricks are the softest bricks and are laid in very soft mortar later harder bricks are laid in harder mortar old mortar may have deteriorated over the years from wall movement and weather first it should be determined if any mortar deterioration has been caused by factors other than time and weather and these problems should be corrected in many cases repointing of the mortar will be sufficient restore the visual and physical integrity of the masonry wall repainting should be done by a trained craftsman new mortar should match the original in composition color and detailing very old very soft bricks should be repainted with a very soft mortar modern mortars which are much too hard will force the stress of wall movement into the masonry units instead of the mortar causing the units to crack and crumble matching the composition of the original mortar will also help in matching the color many joints in 19th century brick walls were detailed with tools after the joints were laid this tooling produced a variety of profiles in the joints repainted mortar joints should match the orig replacement masonry if a masonry wall requires patching the replacement section should match the original as closely as possible new or salvaged masonry units should match the existing ones in size type and texture bricks or blocks should match the full range of tones in the original wall mortar should be of the same composition and color the units should be laid in the same bond as the originals and the width and profile of the mortar joints should match those of the original wall cleaning before cleaning a masonry wall consider that what often appears to be dirt is actually a patina of age and weathering which the brick has acquired over time this patina gives the masonry an aged historic character which contemporary manufacturers try unsuccessfully to imitate the patina also acts as a natural sealant and helps to protect the masonry units from weathering most cleaning methods will remove a thin layer of the masonry itself in the process of removing dirt unless pollutants are actively damaging the masonry it is often best not to clean the wall if masonry cleaning is required the gentlest effective means should be used in many cases the water from a garden hose a mild detergent soft bristle brush and a little elbow grease will vastly improve the appearance of a masonry wall if a pressured water or steam system is considered the lowest effective pressure should be used chemical cleaners are not recommended because of their uncertain results which can include permanent stains and efflorescence if chemical cleaners are being considered the advice of a professional should be sought and a test patch conducted on their instructions this is not a job for homeowners or amateurs do not sandblast masonry walls sandblasting will literally remove the outer crust of the masonry and ruin its ability to withstand weather waterproof coatings are not recommended as they interfere with masonrys natural ability to breathe moisture from interior condensation can get trapped in a waterproofed wall and cause many problems masonry should not be painted within the historic district powells masonry walls were not traditionally painted and paint is almost impossible to remove in the future without damaging the masonry new construction in the historic district brick should be used for commercial and public buildings only use sand mold red  bricks in standard brick sizes these should be laid in simple bonds similar to the ones found in powell very elaborate mosaic brickwork is not appropriate in the historic district wood siding most of the buildings in powell are sheathed in some form of wood siding beveled shiplap and rustic sidings are used commonly boardandbatten siding is used occasionally for small areas of a building board and batten siding is more appropriate for accessory buildings or small subordinate additions every effort should be made to retain and repair wood siding within the historic district deteriorated wood siding usually appears to be in worse condition than it actually is many problems with paint on wood siding are caused by excess moisture proper ventilation of the siding will often solve this problem in most cases a few minor repairs with glue nails putty paint and new sections of wood are all that is required often sanding and a new coat of paint will be sufficient to vastly improve the appearance of wood siding small cracks in individual boards can be repaired by filling the crack with glue or putty and nailing crack warped boards can be screwed flat or shimmed from behind and nailed flat deteriorated sections of siding can be cut out and replaced with a new section a general gapping or looseness of the siding may a be sign that new siding is required if the boards are not badly warped however renailing can solve the problem if complete residing is necessary it should be done in a material which matches the original siding as closely as possible in texture and pattern new wood siding in the same pattern as the original is the preferred replacement material for deteriorated wood siding wood siding is a very appropriate material for new construction within the historic district most of the types commonly  used in the city are horizontal with board widths of 4 to 5 inches a few of the houses have double v rustic type siding in which an extra groove is carved in the center of each board giving the appearance of 2 inch board width wood siding used in new construction should resemble these typical siding types in profile and board width any wood siding used in the historic district should be painted not stained in colors appropriate to the district as outlined in the section on painting and colors wall shingles wood shingles rarely cover an entire structure in powells historic district they are used primarily as decorative accents on queen anne stick and bungalow style buildings and in the gables of simpler buildings fishscale square octagonal arrow and diamond patterned shingles are found on structures throughout the city occasionally two or more patterns are used together for a lively textural effect existing wood shingles should be retained and repaired shingles in good condition appear as a perfect mosaic worn shingles appear ragged with individual shingles broken warped and upturned individual shingles can be replaced but if a large number of the shingles in a small area are damaged it may be easier to reshingle the entire area if replacement shingles are required the preferred solution is to use individual wood shingles which match the original ones the use of wood shingles in new construction within the historic district is encouraged shingles should be limited to smaller areas of a structure such as a gable or bay window all shingles used within the district should be painted not stained appropriate color schemes are outlined in the painting and colors section manufactured siding asbestos shingles during the 1940s many buildings in powell were covered with asbestos shingles these shingles were manufactured in one size 12 inches tall by 24 inches wide three patterns wavy straight and staggered and a few stock colors the thin brittle slabs were often corrugated to resemble wood shingles asbestos shingles were extremely popular with homeowners of the time because they were impervious to rain and rot and highly fire resistant asbestos shingles are no longer manufactured since it has been discovered that the fiber and dust from asbestos are hazardous to human health the shingles as they exist on the exterior of a building pose no threat to human health the safest course of action is to leave the asbestos shingles alone although these shingles may have changed the character of the buildings they cover they are a part of the history of powell their presence reflects one of the many changes the city has gone as well as the practicality and economy of its citizens the removal of asbestos shingles is not encouraged unless the condition of the original siding material has been investigated carefully removal of asbestos shingles may be appropriate in certain situations if the asbestos shingles are in poor condition and it has been determined that the old siding underneath is in good condition exhibits good design or fine craftsmanship removal may be desirable asbestos shingles should not be removed with the intention of replacing the covered material with an inappropriate contemporary substitute certain precautions must be taken when working with asbestos shingles in general they should be kept as moist as possible to prevent particles from becoming airborne and a respirator or mask should be worn at all times asbestos shingles should never be sanded drilled or cut owners and contractors are strongly encouraged to contact the ohio environmental protection agency in columbus for additional information about asbestos hazards before beginning work since asbestos shingles are no longer manufactured the best source for replacements is salvage from another building where they have been removed broken shingles can be turned upside down and the broken edge hidden under an overlapping shingle the shingles are most vulnerable along the bottom course and at the corners wood trim pieces can be installed to cover broken shingles and protect others another possible alternative is to cut an 18 thick piece of fiberglass or plastic to match existing shingles and paint it to match the rest of the wall in most cases asbestos shingles will take multiple coats of paint quite easily aluminum and vinyl siding the use of aluminum and vinyl siding in new construction or to replace existing wood siding should not be considered unless all other possible courses of action have been explored neither type of artificial siding is truly maintenance free aluminum dents easily and must eventually be painted vinyl siding can warp tear and crack neither type of siding has the true character of aged wood siding if aluminum or vinyl siding must be used care must be taken to detail it in a manner which is compatible with the wood siding types which are prevalent in the city the replacement siding should be two to five inches in width with a profile similar to those typically found in powell the siding should resemble the material it is trying to imitate artificial graining should be avoided as it does not appear on good wood siding original detailing such as fascia and soffit trim window and door frames lintels and sills must be maintained corner and sill boards should be retained or replicated in the new material in dimensions which match the originals roofing the roof of a building is important in establishing its character the materials which cover a roof are an important aspect of this character common roofing materials used in powell include slate metal and asphalt shingles slate with a life expectancy of 100 years slate is one of the most durable roofing materials in powell slate is a thin laminated rock which is used as a roofing and siding material host slate roofs exhibit a range of iridescent tones from a rosy pink range of grays to a greenish tint slate is used on both roofs and dormers in powells historic district most of the slate used in powell is octagonal shaped but these octagonal slates are sometimes combined with rectangular ones to enliven the surface of a roof existing slate roofs should be retained and repaired whenever possible in most cases a slate roof can be repaired a roofer who has experience with slate should be consulted before a decision to replace the slate is made deteriorated slates can be removed by cutting the nails which hold it in place and sliding in a replacement slate any replacement slates should match the patterning and color range of the roof in which they are being placed a number of artificial slate products have come on the market recently many of these imitation slates bear a remarkable resemblance to the genuine material these products may be appropriate for replacement roofing or new construction but they should be used with caution most of these artificial slates are new products and their performance in field conditions has not yet been proven metal a few of the buildings in powells historic district have metal roofs most of these roofs are built of tin and are either batten or standing seam types these types of roofs were popular in rural areas in the 19th century every effort should be made to retain and repair existing tin roofs tin or tinlike roofs may be used as replacements on structures which currently have such roofs if evidence can be found that a building had a tin roof historically then a similar metal replacement would also be appropriate replacement roofs should match the originals in color profile and spacing of seams metal roofs which are similar to those typically found in powell are appropriate for new construction modern metal roofing is available in a wide range of colors and profiles only silvergray tin colors are appropriate for use in the historic district metal roofs other than batten or standing seam types are not appropriate for use in the district asphalt shingles many houses in the historic district have already had their roofs replaced with asphalt shingles in many cases these types of shingles are appropriate as replacements for slate or for use on new construction asphalt shingles are now available in a variety of colors variated grays are the most appropriate for use in the historic district the more tones of gray in the asphalt shingles the more closely it will resemble slates range of tones white or very light colors should not be used asphalt shingles laid in a diamond pattern with rolled or thickened seams can create a roof texture which is reminiscent of octagonal patterned slate asphalt shingles which attempt to replicate wood shingles are not appropriate in the historic district and should not be used massing mass describes the visual effect of a solid object as seen from the outside mass is a three dimensional property which has dimensions of length width and height most buildings in powell are created from a number of masses for example a rectangular mass for the body of the house and a triangular one for the roof the term massing is used in this section to describe the form and shape of the overall structure which has been composed from simple masses building types building type massing refers to the shape and form of the main block of a structure and its roof all obvious additions and subordinate projections are ignored when determining the building type massing cottage dwellings of a variety of plan shapes which are characterized by a smallness of scale and a fineness of detail most of these buildings are one or one and a half stories in height they tend to be asymmetrical in plan and do not have the appearance of one single mass which bungalows exhibit powells best example of a cottage is located at 111 north liberty street upright and wing a two story front street facing gable upright is flanked by a recessed wing of one or one and half stories with its gable perpendicular to the upright a partial or full length porch often runs along the front of the wing typical upright and wings can be found at 92 east and 77 and 78 west olentangy street gabled ell in its simplest terms a two story house in the form of the letter l the ell is created by two sections with perpendicular gables which meet at a right angle the block parallel to the street is usually wider than its perpendicular wing often by twice as many bays a one story porch often runs along the block parallel to the street gabeled ells are abundant in powell a few examples are the martin perry house 57 west olentangy street and 37 south liberty street single gable buildings of this type have one recognizable main block rectangular proportions and are generally two stories in height the entire main block is capped with a simple roof with its single gable facing the street proportions may vary slightly from elongated with a very narrow front to almost square a one story porch may run either along the entire width of the front or surround three sides these elements are always subordinate to the main rectangular mass two of powells single gables are 40 case street and 57 scioto street american four square houses of this type are square in plan cubical in shape and two stories in height four squares are usually capped by a low hipped roof a dormer also low and square in proportion is usually centered in the front slope of the roof often a low stocky porch extends across the front of the house 119 north and 110 south liberty street are two of powells american four squares bungalow bungalows are technically one story houses with dormers or gable windows to light the roof space however many one and a half and two story houses of the early twentieth century were designed to have a one story appearance these bungalows have low horizontal proportions most bungalows have the appearance of one single block achieved use of a massive roof which may extend beyond the outside walls of a house to shelter any porches the only interruption to the mass may be a single dormer often centered in the front two examples of bungalows in powell can be found at 236 south liberty street and 71 west olentangy street commercial building these buildings generally appear taller than the surrounding two story residences most are actually two stories tall but each story is slightly taller than a standard residential story their flat or slightly sloped roofs and boxy massing also contribute to the sense of greater height one story commercial buildings may achieve an appearance of extra height by the use of a taller front wall which projects above the roof line of the back and sides of the buildings most of powells commercial type buildings can be found near the corner of olentangy and liberty streets irregular buildings whose main massing discounting obvious additions and subordinate projections does not fall neatly into one of the above categories queen anne style buildings such as 147 west olentangy street are almost always irregularly massed new construction new construction which is in harmony with the existing character of powell is encouraged within the historical district this does not mean that new buildings must be exact copies of older ones contemporary design which is compatible with existing structures in massing materials and detailing is encouraged in this manner powell will continue to experience the growth change and variety of architecture which has given the city much of its character and charm the buildings at the corner of olentangy and liberty streets should be commercial types in a scale similar to existing commercial buildings similar buildings slightly smaller in scale may also be appropriate on lots immediately adjacent to the corner lots these buildings should also be built right up to the sidewalk line as are the existing ones tall commercial building types are appropriate only at the corner of olentangy and liberty streets in other areas of the historic district the massing of new construction should reflect that of existing stuctures other than commercial types every effort should be made to break up the massing of these buildings use of wings projections porches roof slopes and dormers the typical building types which have been discussed provide a variety of massing types which can be used as guidelines most of these examples are made up of two or more masses even those which strive for the appearance of one block single gables american four squares and bungalows have their masses reduced by roof slopes porches and dormers massive blocky buildings and long linear buildings are not appropriate anywhere in the historic district roofs roofs play a significant visual role in the massing of powells historic buildings roofs can take many forms  the illustrations below show several common roof shapes found in late 19th century and early 20th century architecture most buildings in powell have traditional gable roofs slopes or pitches range from a rise of 7 feet in a run of 12 feet about 30 degrees to a rise of 14 feet in a run of 12 feet about 50 degrees the average pitch is a rise of 11 feet in a run of 12 feet about 42 degrees gable roof shapes occur in all types of buildings especially upright and wings gabeled ells and single gables a variation on this type which occurs frequently in the city could be called the bungalow roof in this variation the front plane of the roof is longer than the rear plane and the pitches of these planes may be the same or slightly different several buildings in powell have hipped roofs this type occurs primarily on american four squares a few buildings in powell have flat or shed roofs these occur primarily on taller commercial structures gambrel roofs are traditionally used on agricultural buildings 36 north liberty street is one of the very few buildings in powell with this roof shape most roofs in powell are composed of one or two simple forms such as intersecting gables forming an l or t shape some city roofs are a bit more elaborate enlivened by dormers and gablets dormers occur most frequently on houses which do not have a full second story they are used to light and ventilate the roof space making it usable for living space gabled dormers occur primarily on cottages single gables and some bungalows hipped dormers often enliven the hipped roofs of american four squares shed dormers occur most frequently on bungalows although they are occasionally used on the upright of upright and wings most upright and wing gabeled ell and commercial type buildings do not contain dormers of any type gablets are miniature gables which often top hipped roofs they are sometimes used to add complexity to the roofs of queen anne style buildings new construction new construction in the historical district should use the roof forms and slopes typical to the city these roof types should be used in an appropriate manner and location this does not mean that a roof type may only be used on the building type to which it is associated examining the ways in which certain roof forms were used can help to determine their appropriate use gable roofs are most appropriate for new construction in the historic district their breadth length and slope should be similar to those of existing gable roofs as excessively wide long or steeply pitched gables would not be appropriate bungalow roofs should be used only where a second story is being disguised as their size would cause taller buildings to appear too massive hipped roofs are very useful where a sloped roof is needed but a small roof desired cubical two story buildings such as american four squares can benefit from such a roof flat roofs should be used only on commercial type buildings built at or near the corner of olentangy and liberty streets see building types  new construction section shed roofs may be used for commercial buildings in the above location for accessory buildings and leanto type projections gambrel roofs should be used with caution as they belong primarily in the very rural areas outside the city limits roof forms can be used to break up the overall mass of a building in order to be effective they must look and function like roofs for example if the intention is to render an upper story like a roof simply siding the straight full height walls in a roofing material will not be effective the roof must slope preferably within the range of pitches typical to the city and be detailed like a roof with eaves gutters and typical roofing material natural light can be admitted use of dormers and gable windows dormers can be used to break up the mass of a roof or make an upper story habitable they can not take the place of projections and wings necessary to break up the mass of the building itself dormers should be scaled appropriately to their type and use gabled and hipped dormers should appear as small individual elements on a roof slope shed dormers on a bungalow roof may be somewhat wider running most of the length of a roof ridge dormers which run the entire length of a roof ridge are rarely appropriate as they add too much mass to a building additions much of the architecture of powell has a definite additive quality many buildings contain projections and wings subordinate to the main building mass in some cases these additions were actually constructed at the same time as the main structure but were detailed to look added on in other cases a building has collected extra rooms lean tos enclosed porches and perhaps even a second story over its lifetime these changes aver time are important to the history of a building and can add great charm to an otherwise simple mass appropriate additions to existing buildings in the historical district are encouraged a close look at additions made in the past can yield clues to sympathetic design of contemporary additions in general additions to an existing building should be compatible with that building in massing materials and level of detail it is not necessary nor desirable that additions match the existing buildings exactly contemporary design is encouraged as long as it is in harmony with the character of the historic district this will continue the tradition of growth and change in powell without completely altering the essential character of the city the mass of any addition should be kept subordinate to the mass of the main portion of the building this means that the addition should be smaller and shorter than the main portion of the building the roofline of an addition should not appear as a continuation of the main form or roof nor should it mimic or complete existing forms or rooflines if the proposed size of an addition threatens to compete with the main block of the building breaking the required space into two or more smaller masses should be considered another alternative is to construct all or part of the required new space as a separate accessory building following the guidelines for accessory buildings in the site considerations section innapropriate addition addition duplicates existing forms and rooflines exactly addition completes existing roof addition is very difficult to distinguish from original building symmetrical result is not in character with powell architectural elements architectural and decorative elements refer to the details of a building windows doors porches and ornamentation add character and flavor to buildings they give life to a facade by introducing light and shadow details can also help to identify the period and style of an historic building most of the detailing on powells buildings is simple in nature but there are several examples of more elaborate decoration even very simple detailing plays an important role in establishing the character of older buildings existing ornamentation within powells historic district should be retained and repaired whenever possible it is especially important to protect and preserve examples of skilled craftsmanship in the historic district if a major portion of the detailing on one of powells buildings is missing or beyond repair there are two appropriate solutions one option is to reproduce as exactly as possible the missing or deteriorated element this method requires thorough research especially if no physical evidence is available such as a deteriorated but recognizable element physical photographic or other type of reliable historic evidence should be used when reproducing missing elements another option is to design a simplified version of the missing or deteriorated element which replicates the important visual characteristics of the original these characteristics include composition size proportion texture and rhythm this second option is often cheaper than exact reproduction as it can use some standard contemporary materials simplified replacement elements do require careful attention to detail and design talent in many cases the services of an architect will be necessary when new construction is being contemplated in the historic district careful attention to details can help create architecture which is contemporary but compatible with the historic character of the city exact replication of typical architectural and decorative elements in the city is not necessary or desirable a more appropriate approach is to design new elements to reflect the important visual characteristics of typical powell elements whether architectural and decorative elements are being repaired replaced or used in new construction the effect of any one element on the whole composition of the building must be studied carefully although some elements such as an elaborate porch dominate visually it is the effect of all the elements working together which truly defines the character of a building windows windows are one of the most direct expressions of a buildings character their proportions influence the overall proportions of the building and their functional and decorative treatments are very important in the composition of a facade many of the buildings in powell have had their windows replaced over time as a result a wide variety of window types and proportions exists today although replacement windows are a part of the history of a building many of the changes which have been made in powell have radically altered the proportions and character of the buildings there are three basic types of windows which are historically correct within the historic district doublehung ribbon and fixed sash the most common type of window in the city is doublehung straighttopped and has tall thin proportions these windows range from two to three times as tall as they are wide twoovertwo or oneoverone pane divisions are typical a few exceptions to the standard type of doublehung window can be found in powell most of powells brick buildings such as the schoolhouse at 80 s liberty street have segmental arched windows in some early 20th century houses the upper sashes of doublehung windows are leaded in a pattern of four or five vertical divisions doublehung windows occur on all types of buildings in powell generally earlier types of buildings such as upright and wings and gabeled ells have taller and thinner windows in proportions approaching three times as high as their are wide later building types such as bungalows and american four squares have windows closer in proportion to twice as high as they are wide first story windows are generally taller than second story windows in all types of buildings a less common type of window in powell is a ribbon of three or four windows which occurs primarily in the dormers of bungalows true ribbon windows are separated only by their frames in some cases powells ribbon windows are actually separated by very thin pieces of wall since the overall effect is that of glass and frame only they can be considered ribbon windows these windows tend to have shorter proportions ranging from one and two thirds to two times as tall as they are wide the least common type of window in powell is the fixed sash fixed sash windows occur in various shapes ranging from fairly tall and thin to almost square the most common type is a single large pane one and a half to two times as high as it is wide in some cases fixed sash windows have an upper transom which is usually one third of the overall window height fixed sash windows are primarily used as an accent on a main facade they frequently occur on the upright portion of an upright and wing or the front facing gable of a gabeled ell a bay window is a combination of angled walls and windows which projects from a building and rests on a foundation some of powells italianate and queen anne buildings have such windows powells bay windows are composed of typical double hung windows surrounded by a variety of detailing every attempt should be made to retain and repair existing wood doublehung windows the doublehung system provides good ventilation by allowing the top and bottom of a window to be opened at the same time in addition wood windows provide better insulation than metal ones the major problems with old windows are broken glass inoperable sashes and decayed wood broken panes can be removed replaced and reset in fresh putty loose panes may simply need fresh putty inoperable sashes may be caused by a broken sash cord multiple layers of paint or a frame which is no longer square sash cords can be replaced easily there is usually an access panel at the bottom inside of the frame a window which has been painted shut can be freed gently with a dull knife and a little paint remover even window frames which are no longer square  due to settlement or weather can be repaired by squaring the frame in the rough opening deteriorated wood window parts can often be repaired by cutting out rotted portions and filling holes with putty plastic wood or a homemade paste of waterproof glue and sawdust severe deterioration or deterioration in structural members lintels and sills can sometimes be repaired with epoxy resins a final coat of paint will protect repaired wood windows and restore their original appearance parts of a window should be replaced only if they are deteriorated beyond repair or are missing replacement parts should match the originals in material and appearance sometimes it is necessary to replace an entire window replacement windows should match the originals in material size number of panes and type of operation in addition rails stiles and mullions should match the originals in thickness and depth under no circumstances should a significant window opening be made smaller to accommodate a stock window such a treatment will ruin not only the proportions of the window itself but those of the entire building in addition to the window itself the trim sills lintels and hood molding which surround it adds to the character of a building window trim has aesthetic and practical purposes first the trim provides a visual transition from the sheathing material to the window window trim also protects the joint between the window and the wall from the elements original window treatments should be maintained as much as possible deteriorated trim can usually be repaired by filling holes with putty plastic wood or epoxy and painting in many cases sanding and new coat of paint is all that is needed if window trim must be replaced new trim should match the original in width and detailing as closely as possible if replacement windows are installed care must be taken to preserve and protect all original wood trim if trim must be removed to install new windows it should be treated with care until it is back in place blocking of existing windows is not encouraged windows on major or highly visible facades should never be blocked in some cases it may be necessary to block a window on a secondary facade to accommodate changes in the interior arrangement of a building this should be undertaken only after all other possible courses of action have been considered if blocking an opening is the only practical solution it should be done in such a manner that the original opening and all trim will be preserved the infill should also be removable in the future without damage to the original opening the preferred method of blocking an opening is to infill the opening with a stud wall sheathing and wood shutters another alternative is to infill the opening with a recessed panel of the exterior sheathing material this panel should be recessed at least one inch in order to maintain the original opening and trim new construction new construction within the historic district should use window types and proportions characteristic of powell doublehung windows in tall thin proportions are appropriate in almost all types of powell buildings in general the proportions of windows should reflect the proportions of the building taller thinner buildings with more articulated masses should have taller thinner windows buildings which have the appearance of one single main mass can take shorter squarer windows ribbon windows should be used on dormers or facades which are not highly visible as they were not used extensively in the city except in dormers larger fixed sash windows with or without transoms should be limited to one or two as accents on the main facade square windows are appropriate only in limited situations such as dormers which require square windows windows which are wider than they are tall are not appropriate and should not be used in the historic district colonial type sashes divided into more than two panes sixoversix eightovereight etc are characteristic of 18th century architecture using these smaller paned windows will create a false earlier appearance which is not appropriate in powells historic district new construction should follow the proportions of window to wall found in typical powell buildings buildings with more articulated masses should have less window and more wall single mass buildings should have more windows to enliven their facades typical window to wall proportions are illustrated below if large expanses of glass are desired they should be limited to one area of a facade which is not highly visible they should be designed with vertical divisions which will create a module reminiscent of typical city window proportions these larger sections of glass should be integrated with other fenestration for example an odd number of units might have the middle piece centered on an existing upper story window most of the windows in powell are detailed with simple trim and this simplicity should be reflected in new construction it is not necessary for window surrounds in new construction to duplicate existing ones exactly it is more important that the sense of a lintel frame and sill be conveyed window trim should be substantial enough to reflect the dimensions width and thickness of window treatments typically found in powell aluminum windows wood windows are preferred for replacement or new construction in the historic district if aluminum windows must be used they must resemble as closely as possible typical wood window dimensions used in powell all of the guidelines discussed under replacement windows and new construction apply for aluminum as well as wood windows aluminum windows should have a permanent finish in white bronze black or a color which matches painted wood trim avoid natural silver colored aluminum finishes combination wood and aluminum windows may be acceptable for replacement or new construction these types of windows have wood rails stiles and mullions which are either clad or replicated in aluminum on the exterior often the wood parts have dimensions similar to those found in traditional windows since the wood is either clad or matched on the exterior in metal these windows can closely resemble traditional wood windows the guidelines for both wood and aluminum windows apply to combination windows storm and screen windows storm windows can help conserve energy in the winter and screen windows may be necessary for ventilation in the summer storm windows should be installed on the exterior of existing buildings to avoid condensation on original windows in this location they can also protect the historic windows from further weathering storm and screen windows are appropriate in the historic district if they are as unobtrusive as possible storm windows should be the same size and proportion as the windows being protected any rails should coincide with rails on the main windows aluminum or wood storm windows are acceptable all frames should be painted to match the main window frame color doors the front door of a building performs many functions it announces the entry visually and is often the first element which visitors encounter at a close range in older buildings the importance of the front door was recognized by the care given to its design most buildings in powell have a single front door with simple trim which matches the window trim on the building typical doors are simple in design with either four wood panels or a single glazed panel above a wood one glazed doors generally have modest moldings around the glass pane and either simple molding or carving in the solid panel below an elaborate version of this door can be found at 15 north liberty street and a simpler version appears on the martin perry house existing wood or glass paneled doors should be retained and repaired whenever possible many doors which appear badly deteriorated simply need to be sanded and painted paneled doors are constructed of slender wood or glass panels enclosed in a heavy structural frame the panels are the weakest part of an old door and usually the first part which requires repair wood panels generally stay intact but if they have been damaged they can be replaced with plywood and the whole door repainted broken glass panels should be replaced with glass ornamentation such as molding or carving should be preserved missing or badly deteriorated pieces should be replicated as closely as possible original wood door frames lintels and sills should be retained and repaired repair techniques for lintels frames and decorative molding will be similar to those outlined in the section on windows door sills are one of the first parts of a door frame which will show wear deteriorated wood sills can be repaired in two ways the rotted portions can be scraped out and filled with an epoxy stabilizer in many cases it will be easier to simply pry up the old sill and replace it with a new sill the new sill should be made out of wood in the same thickness as the original if the old sill can be removed in one piece it can be used as a pattern otherwise careful measurements of the original should be taken before removal new construction doors used in new construction within the historic district should be similar to those typically found in powell these doors should be simple in design and generally vertical in proportion three or four paneled wood doors or doors with a glazed upper panel are appropriate doors with more than four wood panels or several small panes of glass are generally too elaborate for the simple buildings typical of powell modern flush doors are too simple and are not appropriate in the historic district all exterior doors in the historic district should be painted to match or coordinate with building trim color guidelines are given in the section on painting door trim used in new construction should reflect the traditional trims which are similar to those illustrated for windows these trims need not be exact duplicates of existing powell door treatments it is more important that the scale and substance of the trim be similar to that of traditional door surrounds the expression of lintel frame and sill should be inherent in contemporary door treatments steel doors although wood doors are preferred steel doors may be appropriate for replacement or new construction wood doors provide better insulation especially when fitted with weather stripping but metal doors may desired for security or maintenance reasons steel doors used for replacement or new construction within the historic district should have some type of paneled or paneled and glazed design which reflects traditional city doors steel doors should be painted to match other trim according to the paint color guidelines storm and screen doors storm doors can be very useful in saving energy and screen doors may be necessary for ventilation in some of powells older homes which do not have air conditioning these doors may be appropriate in the historic district  but they must be as unobtrusive as possible this means that wood or metal storm doors should match the doors which they are protecting storm or screen door frames should coincide with framed areas on the main door areas of screen or glass should coincide with appropriate paneled or glazed areas on the door which they are protecting any solid portions of screen doors should be detailed to match the corresponding area of the main door the screen or storm door should be painted the same color as the main door porches almost every building in powell has a porch in many cases the porch is the focal point of the facade being the one element which exhibits any type of stylistic detailing powells porches come in a variety of sizes ranging from small barely covering a door to wrapping three sides of a house porches in powell fall into two basic categories simple porches have round or square columns and simple railings or no railings more elaborate porches have eastlake italianate or queen anne detailing with curved brackets turned posts carved areas and patterned shingles most of powells original porches were constructed of wood their bases were either framed up in wood or constructed out of the foundation material used for the main portion of the building wood porches generally had a wood floor and a wood base molding a very few porches in powell have columns built out of rock face cast concrete block porch stairs were originally built out of wood or limestone but most of these have been replaced with concrete stairs every effort should be made to repair and retain existing wood porches in the historic district repair techniques similar to those outlined for wood window trims can be used on porch detailing if pieces of the porch are missing or deteriorated beyond repair they should be replaced replacements should match the originals as closely as possible in material scale and detailing under no circumstances should a porch in the historic district be removed and not replaced in kind if an entire porch has deteriorated beyond repair it should be replaced with one which matches it in material scale and detailing if it is impossible to match the porch exactly it may be appropriate to construct a reasonable reproduction out of stock lumber in this case the size scale and overall form of the original elements should be replicated columns and entablatures should appear similar in strength to the original pediments should have the same pitch and should rest on an entablature of the same thickness as the original these should also be faced with a similar material such as patterned shingles railings should reflect the open or solidness of the original balusters should have the same form and spacing as the originals  moldings should reflect the replaced ones in scale and thickness although they need not be as elaborate bases and steps should be reconstructed out of wood or wood over masonry as the originals were special attention should be given to details such as base moldings and stair nosings the closing in of existing porches is not encouraged new construction all new buildings constructed within the historic district should have some type of porch element these porches should reflect the types and styles of porches which exist in powell once again exact duplication is not desirable new or reconstructed porches should reflect the size scale and level of detail of the buildings to which they are attached in general buildings which exhibit vertical proportions and articulated massing such as gabled ells upright and wings and buildings with irregular massing should have porches with vertical proportions columns should be taller and thinner and railings if used should be open and delicate in scale buildings which tend to be more of a single mass such as american four squares single gables bungalows or similar structures should have heavier more substantial porches columns should have thick and stocky proportions railings should be solid or made up of wider balusters closely spaced buildings with simple detailing and little or no stylistic ornamentation should have modest porches with plain round or square columns these simple porches may have a very simple railing or none at all buildings which have more elaborate stylistic ornamentation should have more elaborate porches new construction with italiante eastlake or queen anne type detailing or new buildings which are enlivened by a variety of patterned shingles will require porches with similar ornamentation these porches can have turned posts curved brackets patterned shingles elaborate railings and carved details new buildings which reflect some of the later styles such as stick style and bungalow should have porches with geometric detailing simple square posts and railings which are solid or made up of square balusters would be appropriate on these types of houses another alternative is to contrast an elaborate porch against a building with simple massing or detailing care must be taken to balance the level of detail in the porch and house so that one does not overwhelm the other and the building and porch appear to belong together 15 north liberty street is a successful example of contrasting a highly detailed porch against a simple mass an elaborate eastlake porch wraps a single gable building newly constructed or reconstructed porches in the historic district should be built primarily of wood porch bases may be constructed of wood or the foundation material used in the rest of the building the porch floor should be wood and should rest visually on a wood base molding stairs should be built out of wood in general masonry brick stone block or concrete porches are not appropriate in the historic district wrought iron columns and railings or aluminum replicas are inappropriate for replacement or new construction overly rustic wood porches with rough split or log posts and railings which resemble fences should be avoided in the historic district cornices and friezes cornice refers to the projecting piece of trim which terminates the upper part of a wall the frieze is the trim on the upper portion of a wall which supports the cornice in many cases the term cornice is used to refer to the entire composition of cornice and frieze this trim serves a practical purpose as well as providing an opportunity for stylistic embellishment the cornice and frieze seal off the critical junction of the roof and wall structures and help support the roof overhang elaborate cornices occur primarily on powells italianate eastlake and commercial buildings sometimes these elements occur on a portion of a building such as a bay window or porch in general italianate friezes consist of curved brackets separated by paneled areas in some cases the frieze is a simple flat molding such as a dentil molding existing cornices and friezes should be preserved if parts are deteriorated they should be repaired by cutting out rotted parts and filling cracks with putty or epoxy if elements are beyond repair or missing they should be replaced in kind cornices can often be duplicated using stock moldings brackets can be duplicated using thick boards and a jig saw if the brackets are quite elaborate it may be easier to make a mold of an existing one which can be duplicated in plastic or sheet metal under no circumstances should an entire cornice and frieze be removed if it is in repairable condition if these elements are beyond repair they should be replaced with trim which resembles the original since exact duplication of a very detailed frieze is difficult it is appropriate to imitate the size bulk and rhythm of the original with simplified detail new construction cornices and friezes will be optional decorative elements in most new construction the exception is on taller commercial scale buildings constructed near the intersection of olentangy and liberty streets the larger scale of these buildings will require a terminating feature at the roofline cornices used in new construction need not be exact duplicates of those existing in powell a simplified version which reflects the scale substance and rhythm of typical city cornices will be appropriate as with all decorative elements cornices should match the scale and level of detail of the other elements of a building cornices used on commercial scale buildings should be fairly large about one eighth to one sixth of the total height of the building and should extend along all facades visible from main roads cornices used on smaller scale buildings should be smaller in scale and less elaborate in detail gutters and downspouts most of the buildings in powells historic district have simple unobtrusive hung gutters hung gutters are steel troughs hung from the eaves of the roof the primary visual contribution of this type of gutter is another shadow or cornice line at the edge of a roof roof gutters in powell serve an important practical purpose they protect the roof walls and structure of a building by ensuring proper drainage of water from the roof existing gutters should be inspected periodically and cleared of debris as necessary original gutters in good condition should be retained and repaired as necessary deteriorated gutters may be replaced with aluminum gutters which approximate the size and profile of the original gutters aluminum gutters are appropriate for new construction as long as they have a visual impact similar to typical hung gutters all gutters used in replacement or new construction should be painted to match fascia trim color suggestions for trim can be found in the section on painting and colors downspouts also serve an important practical purpose but they are generally more visually obtrusive than roof gutters downspouts direct water away from the walls of a building and protect the sheathing materials from water damage downspouts should also direct water away from the foundation by either directing it down sloped ground or into a splashblock original downspouts should be retained and repaired especially if they are an integral part of the design of the building periodic inspection and clearing out of debris will insure that downspouts continue to perform their vital drainage function deteriorated downspouts should be replaced in order to insure proper roof drainage if the downspouts are an important visual element in the design of the building they should be replaced with similar downspouts in the original locations downspouts designed for replacement or new construction should painting and colors a good coat of paint is a buildings best defense against the elements paint protects wood siding and trim from deterioration by shedding moisture the exterior of a building will need a new coat of paint about every five to eight years this routine maintenance job is especially important to protect historic materials cracks blistering peeling or exposed bare wood are signs of paint failure in many cases this is due to normal weathering sometimes moisture problems such as improper roof drainage cause paint failure these problems should be solved before repainting or the new coat will fail almost immediately other causes of paint failure could be mistakes in application of previous coats inadequate surface preparation or incompatibility between the paint and the surface being painted in these cases the improperly applied coats will have to be removed and the exposed surface prepared for a new coat most of the existing buildings in powell have several layers of paint removing all of these layers is not necessary or desirable paint should be removed only to the next sound layer using the gentlest effective means if an existing layer appears to be adhering well to previous coats then it can be considered a layer and new paint adhere to it well when repainting an existing building it is appropriate to use original colors original colors can sometimes be determined by doing paint scrapings or analysis although scraping can be done by amateurs it is recommended that an expert be consulted colors may have changed due to chemical makeup of paint and weathering it may be difficult to determine the exact sequence of paint unless one has experience in paint analysis if the original colors can not be determined or are not desirable the color guidelines which follow should be used to create a suitable color scheme paint color is an important visual choice the color guidelines which follow apply for existing buildings or new construction within the historic district in general colors used in the historic district should be muted dark and earthtoned livelier colors should be limited to trim or one accent piece such as a door avoid extremely bright pure colors or using two colors of the same intensity do not use high gloss paint semigloss may be acceptable for high maintenance areas such as porch floors stairs and doors relatively simple color schemes were the most popular during the 19th and early 20th centuries and are the most appropriate for use in the historic district the simpler the building the fever colors should be used since powell architecture is relatively simple color schemes should be kept to two or three colors more elaborate buildings with recognizable styles such as italianate queen anne and eastlake may be enlivened by the use of a variety of tints and shades of basic colors a building can be divided into five basic parts for colors the base  the body  the trim  doors windows and stairs  and the roof the base usually the foundation will have the color inherent in the material out of which it is constructed the body or background color should be compatible with the foundation material especially if the foundation has strong inherent color such as the reds and purples of glazed block the trim includes corner boards cornices water tables door and window trims and porches windows doors and stairs provide other opportunities for color the moving parts of a window sash should be painted white black or another dark color contrasting window trim against a lighter or darker sash will retain the visual integrity of the window and its trim doors can be an excellent opportunity for a splash of brighter color however this color should be carefully coordinated with the rest of the color scheme porch floors and stairs should be painted with heavy duty paint in a neutral gray or dark brown the fifth part of a color composition is the roof in powell most roofs should be some shade of gray slate asphalt or tin these colors will blend well with almost any paint scheme a successful color scheme will unify the five basic parts of a building into a single composition without denying emphasis to distinctive features the color suggestions which follow are intended as guidelines for existing buildings and new construction the type and style designations are based on existing buildings new construction should follow the color groups for the building type and style closest to its form and stylistic detailing new or existing buildings which combine more than one type and style may be painted with colors from both groups in general body color should relate to the basic form of the building and trim color to its stylistic embellishment careful attention must be paid to the overall effect of any paint scheme on the building itself and adjacent buildings color schemes contact development department for approved color samples group 1  cottages a palette of delicate natural colors sand straw earth and clay group 2  italianate gabled ell upright and wing a palette of generally darker colors with a few of the earlier lighter colors persisting more vivid contrast
