from the building inspector that such extensions are not substantial where the nonconforming nature of a single or two family use is increased or where other nonconforming uses are changed or substantially extended the use may be reconstructed altered extended or structurally changed only if the zoning board of appeals determines that such reconstruction alteration extension or structural

town of reading community services health the pumping test was performed depth at which the pump was set for the test location for the discharge line static water level immediately before pumping

including both the pumping time and the recovery time during which measurements were taken recovery water levels and respective times after cessation of pumping and reference point used for all measurements in order to demonstrate that the well capacity can provide the required volume of water a pumping test shall be conducted in the following manner 1 the volume of water necessary to support the households daily need shall be determined using the following equation number of bedrooms plus one bedroom x 110 gallons per bedroom x safety factor of 2   number of gallons needed daily 2 the storage capacity of the well shall be determined using the measured static water level and the depth and radius of the drillhole or casing 3 the required volume shall be calculated by adding the volumes of water in 1 and 2 above it is this volume of water that must be pumped from the well within a twentyfour 24 hour period the pumping test may be performed at whatever rate is desired following the pumping test the water level in the well must be shown to recover to within eightyfive 85 percent of the prepumped static water level within a twentyfour 24 hour period example 1 a one bedroom house with a well six 6 inches in diameter containing 200 feet  of standing water 1 bedroom + 1 bedroom   2 bedrooms x 110 gallons per bedroom x safety factor of 2   440 gallons needed daily 2 the volume of a 6inch well is 15 gallons for every foot of water column length therefore 200 feet  of standing water x 1 5 galfeet    300 gallons 3 440 gallons + 300 gallons   740 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24 hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity recovery to at least 85% of the static water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation of pumping example 2 for a 4 bedroom house with a well that is six 6 inches in diameter containing 100 feet  of standing water 1 4 bedroom house + 1 bedroom   5 bedrooms x 110 gallons per bedroom x safety factor of 2   1100 gallons needed daily 2 the volume of a 6inch well is 15 gallons for every foot of water volume length therefore 100 feet  of standing water x 1 5 galfeet    150 gallons 3 1100 gallons + 150 gallons 1250 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24 hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity recovery to at least 85% of the static water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation of pumping viii water quality testing after the construction of the well has been completed and disinfected and prior to using it as a private drinking water well baseline water quality testing shall

involved in the transfer in the event that there is no buyer at the time the water is tested a copy of all water test results must be given by the owner to the buyer before the property is put under agreement for irrigation wells the board requires annual testing for e coli bacteria and nitratenitrite as accidental consumption could result in acute exposure the board reserves the right to require retesting of the above parameters or testing for additional parameters when in the opinion of the board it is necessary due to local conditions or for the protection of public health safety welfare and the environment all costs and laboratory arrangements for the water testing are the responsibility of the applicant following a receipt of the water quality test results the well owner shall submit a water quality report to the board which includes 1 a copy of the certified laboratorys test results 2 the name and contact information of the individual who performed the sampling town of
