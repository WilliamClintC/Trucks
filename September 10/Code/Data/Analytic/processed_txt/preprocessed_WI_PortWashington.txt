multiplying the area in each such district by the percentage factor given in the following table and then dividing the result by the number of square feet per family unit as required by the table for that district the total allowable density for the project is the sum of those individual computations in the case of a project which includes land classified as wetland floodplain the total allowable density may be increased by the percentage which such land is of the total project area but in no case more than 40% in the case of any such land which is reclaimed from its wetland floodplain characteristic as a result of the project development the total allowable density may be increased by the percentage which such reclaimed land is of the total project area an increase in the computed allowable maximum density not to  planned development projects 21  4 exceed 10% may be permitted upon recommendation of the plan commission that the increased density is justified in terms of the
