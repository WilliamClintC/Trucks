director or chief operator finds after investigation that any user is causing engaging in or maintaining a condition or activity which in his judgment presents an imminent danger to the public health safety or welfare or to the environment or is likely to result in irreversible or irreparable damage to the public sewer system and it therefore appears to be prejudicial to the public interest to delay action until notice and an opportunity for a hearing can be provided the director or chief operator may without prior hearing order such user by notice in writing wherever practicable or in such other form as in the directors or chief operators judgment will reasonably notify such person whose practices are intended to be proscribed to discontinue abate or alleviate such condition or activity or where the giving of notice is impracticable in the event of a users failures to comply voluntarily with an emergency order the director or chief operator may take all appropriate action to abate the violating condition as promptly as possible thereafter not to exceed 15 days the director or chief operator shall provide the user an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provisions of of this chapter b the director or chief operator acting upon the belief that an emergency exists shall be indemnified against any personal liability that may arise in the performance of his duties to protect the public health safety or welfare or preserve the public sewer system a introduction the enforcement response plan is an outline of the procedures to be followed to ensure compliance by industrial users with the city of genevas sewer use the united states environmental protection agencys and new york states pretreatment regulations the enforcement response plan is divided into four  27771 geneva code  27775  sections describes procedures to review and update the list of industrial users to track and screen compliance monitoring data and to schedule sampling and inspection of significant industrial users siu describes the type of enforcement action the city will take in response to anticipated industrial user violations and contains the enforcement response guide describes the enforcement options in detail will contain standard forms and letters to be used to implement the enforcement response plan b administrative procedures 1 personnel the public works director is responsible for the overall implementation of the pretreatment regulations and the enforcement response plan the wwtf chief operator is responsible for the daytoday implementation of the pretreatment program and enforcement response plan the public works director will annually evaluate the wwtfs staff ability to implement the program and provide the necessary level of funding and personnel to accomplish the requirements of the pretreatment program 2 industrial user inventory a the general pretreatment regulations require the periodic updating of the industrial users contributing to the geneva wwtf b every five years a complete industrial user survey shall be done at least annually the industrial user list shall be updated new industrial users must file an industrial residual waste questionnaire and an industrial chemical survey before commencing discharge to the system c the wwtf chief operator shall oversee the industrial user survey the survey shall be comprehensive and complete the telephone book chamber of commerce listing local business directory and inspection of commercial areas shall be used to update the master list the master list shall include all businesses in the service area the master list shall be surveyed to determine what industries are dry processes or wet processes all industries that discharge to the potw shall be sent an industrial chemical survey and an industrial residual waste questionnaire to be completed and returned all completed forms shall be reviewed to determine if they should be classified as a categorical or a significant industrial user d annually the industrial user list shall be reviewed to determine if new industrial users have entered the system this review will be based on building permits and records from the planning commission and building and department the public works director will forward to the wwtf chief operator a copy of all industrial permits issued  27775 railroads  27775  for new connection to the sewer system the planning and zoning commission sends minutes of all meetings to the public works director the public works director will forward any minutes to the wwtf chief operator that involve new industrial activity e the building and department forward all cases of sewer use to the public works director who will forward any pertinent information to the wwtf chief operator f before new industrial users can commence discharge they must have completed an industrial chemical survey and an industrial residual waste questionnaire the public works director and wwtf chief operator will review the forms and determine if the industrial user will be a categorical industry or an siu if the user is determined to be either he or she must have valid discharge permit as required by the sewer use 3 compliance monitoring a significant industries as defined in the sewer use are required to conduct selfmonitoring and submit selfmonitoring reports in accordance with their industrial user discharge permit the frequency of selfmonitoring is determined by past history of compliance discharge volume and the possibility for passinterference or danger to potw works the united states epa pretreatment compliance monitoring and enforcement pcme guidance july 1986 document will be used as a guide for selfmonitoring frequency ultimately the selfmonitoring program must meet the requirements and intent of the general pretreatment regulations and be effective and timely in determining compliance with categorical and local discharge limits b the wwtf chief operator must schedule at least one inspection and one sampling of an siu annually the sampling must be for both categorical and local limits the sampling at a minimum must develop data that is admissible in a court of law the sampling and testing procedures must conform to united states epa standard practices the pcme guidance document will be used as a reference for the sampling 4 screening data a the city will monitor all industrial sampling reports for pretreatment compliance any instance of noncompliance including nondischarge violations will require an enforcement response as outlined in c enforcement response  27775 geneva code  27775  1 determining enforcement response the key element of this enforcement response plan is the enforcement guide table 11  15 this guide is a matrix which describes violations and indicates the range of appropriate enforcement options these options are notice of violation administrative fines administrative orders civil litigation criminal prosecution termination of sewer service and supplemental enforcement responses will fully describe the options the response guide offers several levels of enforcement responses for each type of violation in deciding what level of response is appropriate the past history of the industrial user severity of the violation duration of the violation the effect of the violation on the potw and the environment the intent or negligence of the industrial user and the overall attitude of the industrial user should be considered typically for minor violations notices of violations are issued if the industrial user does not return to compliance within the specified time frame the enforcement response escalates until the industrial user is back in compliance the criteria for determining the appropriate enforcement response are discussed in detail a severity of the violation notices of violations nov are used for isolated instances of noncompliance but any violation no matter how minor must be addressed the epa recommends an industrial user that has a significant noncompliance violation as that term is defined in  2772 be issued an enforceable order ie administrative order that requires a return to compliance by a specific date b duration of violation violations that extend over long periods of time should subject the industrial user to escalated enforcement actions if the industrial user fails to comply with the administrative order then additional fines may be applied if the violations are causing harm to the potw or the receiving stream then civil action or service termination should be considered c effect on potw or receiving stream if any violation causes upsets interference or passthe potw to the receiving stream it should be dealt with a severe and swift response at a minimum the industrial user should be issued an administrative order with a fine if the violation resulted in fines by the epa or nysdec to the city the industrial user should be responsible for the fines if the violation resulted in increased treatment costs or harm to process equipment or treatment works the industrial user should be responsible for the increased costs d past history of the user the past history of compliance of the industry should be considered when considering what level of enforcement is appropriate an industrial user with a good compliance history may be given the least severe and an  27775 railroads  27775  industrial user with a poor compliance history may be given a more severe enforcement response for the same violation e attitude and good faith of user the attitude and good faith of the industrial user in correcting its noncompliance should be taken into consideration when determining the enforcement response but a good attitude cannot eliminate the need for some type of enforcement response 2 personnel responsibilities for enforcement response the city manager the public works director and the wwtf enforcement guide clearly define what actions are to be taken by the city the city manager director of public works and the chief operator are the three city personnel involved in enforcement responses by having responsibilities explicitly spelled out responses to noncompliance will be swift and consistent the general rule is that the chief operator will issue notices of violations and administrative orders the public works director will have the authority to issue administrative orders with fines and showcause orders the city manager will have the authority to issue showcause orders initiate civil action initiate criminal investigation and terminate service 3 enforcement response guide the enforcement response guide table 11  15 will be used to determine the enforcement options for industrial user noncompliance the option selected should be based on the criteria set forth in 1 the following are abbreviations and terms used in the enforcement response guide ao  administrative order cm  city manager co  wwtf chief

all continuing violations the response will include a compliance schedule d violations which threaten health property or environmental quality are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting the discharge or terminating service e all violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance will be addressed with an enforceable order within 30 days of the identification of significant noncompliance d enforcement response options the enforcement response guide table 1115 will be used to determine the appropriate enforcement response this section provides in detail the  27775 geneva code  27775  seven enforcement response options outlined in the enforcement response guide the seven enforcement responses are notice of violation administrative fines administrative orders civil litigation criminal prosecution termination of sewer service and supplemental enforcement responses 1 notice of violation a a notice of violation nov is a letter to an industrial user informing the industrial user of noncompliance with the sewer use industrial discharge permit or pretreatment regulations it is used for nonsignificant violations in the case of significant noncompliance an nov may be issued as a precursor to more severe enforcement action b the city will issue an nov to any industrial user that violates any of its permit limits categorical or local limits the nov will be issued for isolated and insignificant violations failure to submit monitoring reports or other minor violations of the sewer use stated in the enforcement response guide the nov shall be issued within five days of detection of a violation the nov will follow the standard form set forth in the nov will be hand delivered or sent via certified mail to the industrial user copies of the nov shall be sent to the public works director and placed in the industrial user file 2 administrative orders administrative orders aos are enforcement documents which direct industrial users to undertake or to cease specified activities administrative orders are recommended as the formal response to significant noncompliance administrative orders may incorporate compliance schedules and administrative fines the four types of administrative orders that are authorized by the sewer use showcause orders consent orders ceaseanddesist orders and compliance orders a showcause orders a showcause order directs the industrial user to appear before the chief operator public works director or city manager explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not go forward the hearing can be either formal or informal but the hearings should be carefully documented the outcome of most showcause hearings will be a consent order or compliance order and an administrative fine b consent orders  a consent order is an agreement between the city and the industrial user that sets forth compliance schedules remedial actions and any administrative fines the consent order is negotiated by the industrial user and the city the  27775 railroads  27775  industrial user does not need to admit the noncompliance in the text of the order but the consent order prohibits future violations and provides for corrective action on the part of the industrial user  in determining the terms of the consent order the city may take extenuating circumstances into consideration the consent order should address every identified deficiency in the users compliance status at the time of the order c ceaseanddesist orders a ceaseanddesist order orders an industrial user in noncompliance to cease noncomplying discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge completely a ceaseanddesist order will be used in instances where the industrial users discharge could cause passinterference or otherwise create an emergency situation the order should be delivered in person or by certified mail d compliance orders a compliance order directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order a compliance order does not need to be negotiated with the industry compliance orders are typically used when construction process changes or modification of management practices need to be undertaken compliance orders set specific dates by which specified actions are to be completed if the specific deadlines are not met then further enforcement responses are initiated or specified series of penalties are automatically set forth typically fines are associated with compliance orders 3 administrative fines a the sewer use the authority to the city manager and the public works director to assess administrative fines on industrial users for instances of noncompliance the ordinance sets the administrative fines not to exceed $20000 per violation administrative fines may be assessed prior to or subsequent to a hearing the imposition of fines is subject to review as provided in  27769 upon petition of a user b the following schedule should be used as guidance for assessing administrative fines unpermitted discharge $5000 for first offense  $10000 for second offense  $20000 for third offense failure to renew permit $1000 for first offense  $5000 for second offense  $10000 for third offense  27775 geneva code  27775  noncompliance with permit limits $1000 for first offense  $5000 for second offense  $10000 for third offense after one year of compliance fine is reset to $1000 significant noncompliance defined in  2772 up to $20000 for each offense reporting violation $1000 for first offense  $5000 for second offense  $10000 for third offense after one year of compliance fine is reset to $1000 failure to report spills $5000 for first offense  $10000 for second offense  $20000 for third offense failure to monitor $5000 for first offense  $10000 for second offense  $20000 for third offense c the fines listed are for guidance only and do not list all possible instances of penalties that could be incurred if a fine is to be assessed it should reflect the magnitude of the violation the intent of the industrial user and the past history of the industrial user 4 civil litigation the sewer use the city to assess civil penalties of up to $20000 per day for each violation by industrial users of the pretreatment standards the sewer use their industrial user permit conditions civil litigation is an appropriate enforcement response when enforcement efforts based on cooperation with the industrial user have not resulted in a return to compliance civil litigation might also be pursued in emergency conditions where injunctive relief is necessary or to impose civil penalties and recover losses incurred due to the noncompliance the different types of civil litigation are detailed below they include consent decrees injunctions and civil penalties and cost recovery litigation need not be limited to one type  a single case may include all three types a consent decrees consent decrees are agreements between the city and the industrial user for a consent decree to be binding it must be signed by the city the industrial user and the judge consent decrees normally include a schedule for return to compliance and a stipulated civil penalty consent decrees are similar to consent orders but the industrial user acknowledges the noncompliance  27775 railroads  27775  b injunctions injunctions will be used if an industrial user refuses to comply with a previously issued ceaseanddesist order injunctive relief should be pursued if delays involved in filing a suit would result in harm to the potw or the environment c civil penalties and cost recovery civil litigation may be necessary to recover costs associated with noncompliance and to impose civil penalties the city should seek to recover all costs associated with an industrial users noncompliance the costs include legal fees increased treatment costs fines assessed against the city by the epa or nysdec and the cost incurred in enforcement response actions 5 criminal prosecution the sewer use the city to pursue criminal prosecution of individuals or organizations for violations of the sewer use offenses are defined as either felonies or misdemeanors felonies are the more serious charges and are characterized by the clean water act as knowing violations of the clean water act and knowing endangerment of human health knowing violations are punishable by fines up to $50000 per day of violation imprisonment of up to 15 years or both fines and prison sentences under the clean water act are doubled for a second offense federal law defines misdemeanors as offenses other than felonies misdemeanors are punishable by fines of up to $1000000 or imprisonment for less than one year misdemeanor offenses include tampering with monitoring equipment falsifying selfmonitoring reports and failing to report noncomplying discharges criminal prosecution would normally be pursued when there is evidence of criminal intent willfulness negligence andor bad faith shown by the industrial user criminal prosecution is the most severe enforcement response at the citys disposal the city manager and the city attorney will decide whether criminal prosecution is pursued the epa guidance document guidance for developing control authority enforcement response plans september 198 should be used as a reference 6 termination of sewer service a the sewer use the city to terminate an industrial users right to discharge when previous enforcement responses have not returned the industrial user to compliance or a discharge is causing interference passdamage to human health the environment or the potw the enforcement response guide table 11  15 details the instances when termination of service shall be used as an enforcement tool  27775 geneva code  27775  b termination of service can be accomplished desist orders or injunctions in the most severe case the service may have to be physically broken or a plug installed 7 supplemental enforcement responses a the city is required by the general pretreatment regulations 40 cfr 4038f2vii to annually publish in the designated official newspaper a list of industrial users that have had significant violations during the past 12 months more frequent publication of violations can be used to deter industrial users from committing pretreatment violations b the following may be of assistance in returning an industrial user to compliance issue shortterm permits to industrial users that are in noncompliance an industrial user that has infrequent violations of permit limits may be required to increase monitoring frequency to help ensure compliance the regional engineer from the nysdec can be requested to assist in enforcement activities make the industrial user aware of what effects the violations have on the potw the environment and human health e standard forms for forms please consult the city clerks office or the department of public works f any user of the potw aggrieved by any action taken by the director or chief operator pursuant to this section may seek review of such action by filing a petition with the sewer complaint review board a copy of the petition shall be filed with the city manager who shall schedule a hearing before the sewer complaint review board and notify the user of the time and place of the hearing which shall be at least 15 days after filing the petition the hearing proceedings shall be governed by the applicable provisions set forth in  27769 g any final civil penalty andor administrative action fine or order issued by the sewer complaint review board shall be reviewable pursuant to a proceeding commenced pursuant to of the civil practice law and rules within 30 days of the final determination of the sewer complaint review board being filed with the city manager  27775 railroads  27775  article xii validity  27776

unit development pud provision is to encourage a greater degree of flexibility for development and to provide a variety of residential and nonresidential activities in a planned controlled environment in a manner blending all land uses into a functionally and aesthetically complementary whole a planned unit development proposal may contain both individual building sites and common property which are proposed for development as an integrated land use unit a mix of light manufacturingresearch development and commercial uses may be included to provide employment opportunities and enhancements to the tax base retail and service uses may be included to provide for shopping needs 1 this article recognizes that while the standard zoning function use and bulk and the subdivision function platting and design are appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or neighborhoods that are already substantially developed these controls represent a type of preregulation regulatory rigidity and uniformity which may be inimical to the techniques of land development contained in the planned unit development concept a rigid set of space requirements along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the application of this concept thus where pud techniques are deemed appropriate rezoning of land to a planned unit development district by the city council the use and dimensional specifications elsewhere in the codes of the city of geneva are replaced by an approval process in which an approved pud plan becomes the basis for continuing land use controls 2 as presented in this article the planned unit development concept is subdivided into two types of districts a planned residential development prd and a planned commercial development pcd each of which is subject to specific development requirements and limitations for purposes of interpretation the term planned unit development or pud can be taken to mean planned residential development or planned commercial development as appropriate 3 while public lands in the lakefront district do not qualify for regulation under this article it is the intent of the city that the site planning criteria and guidelines which constitute the substance of this article apply to any and all development on public lands in the lakefront zoning district 4 this article is augmented and supplemented by appearance lakefront

within the lakefront district as shown in the attached lakefront district zoning master plan62 the criteria of the appearance applicable to the site plan review process inherent in this article b objectives to implement the intent of the planned unit development provision the following objectives must be met 1 a maximum choice in the types of environment occupancy tenure eg cooperative individual condominium or leasing types of housing lot sizes and community facilities available to persons at all economic levels 2 provision of usable open space and recreation areas and convenience in location of retail sales and service areas 3 a development pattern which preserves trees enhances important vistas and views outstanding natural topography and geographic features and prevents soil erosion 4 a creative use of land and related physical development which allows an orderly transition of land from rural areas 5 an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets 6 a development pattern in harmony with the objectives of this chapter 7 a more desirable environment than would be possible strict application of other articles of this chapter 8 a mixture of land uses to enhance job creation and retention increase of tax base and variety of settings c procedures overview 1 the classification of a property as a planned unit development pud requires the undertaking of a twostep process involving the approval of both the planning board and the city council 2 in the first step the planning board responds initially to the applicants submission of a conceptual sketch plan and a general outline that discusses the contemplated development for the pud the planning board ensures compliance with the general requirements of this article and directs the preparation of the project plan narrative and graphic documentation 3 upon approval of the concept sketch plan the second step involves application for the establishment of a planned unit development 62editors note the lakefront district zoning master plan is on file in the city offices  3508 geneva code  3508  district this step is governed by the city council and requires a public hearing in the case where the planning board files an unfavorable advisory report with the city council the applicant may request a separate review by the city council 4 subsequent to these first two approvals classifying the pud the site plan review process requires that the applicant prepare detailed preliminary and final site development plans which conform to any conditions of approval established in the approval of the initial concept sketch all interpretation of land use regulations related to the proposed pud shall be determined by the planning board d district boundary definition 1 it is the intent of this article that planned unit development apply only to the lakefront zoning district as delineated on the official zoning map63 of the city of geneva 2 modifications to the lakefront zoning district may be subsequently determined and established by city council 3 generally the boundaries of the lakefront zoning district are as follows beginning at the point of intersection of the
