guilty of a misdemeanor punishable in accordance with section 13106 of this code o2568 eff 10162009 ban on onychectomy declawing 52601 findings a there is a widespread misunderstanding in the community regarding a commonly performed surgical procedure known as onychectomy or declawing contrary to most peoples understanding declawing consists of amputating not just the claws but the whole phalanx up to the joint including bones ligaments and tendons b declawing is not a simple cosmetic procedure akin to a manicure or a pedicure on the contrary to remove a claw the bone nerve joint capsule collateral ligaments and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated thus declawing is not a simple single surgery but ten 10 separate painful amputations of the third phalanx up to the last joint of each toe in human terms this is akin to cutting off the last joint of each finger c declawing robs an animal of an integral means of movement and defense because they cannot defend themselves adequately against attacks by other animals declawed animals that are allowed outdoors are at increased risk of injury or death likewise animals subjected to flexor tendonectomy a procedure in which the animals toes are cut so that the claws cannot be extended are also robbed of an integral means of defense and thus imperils its health and safety d research has demonstrated that the rate of complication with onychectomy is relatively high compared to other procedures considered routine complications can include excruciating pain damage to the radial nerve hemorrhage bone chips that prevent healing painful regrowth of deformed claw inside of the paw which is not visible to the eye necrosis lameness and chronic back and joint pain as shoulder leg and back muscles weaken e although there is a widespread belief that declawing makes cats more house friendly and therefore less likely to be abandoned and subsequently euthanized a survey conducted by forgotten felines and friends of caddo parish in louisiana found that approximately seventy percent 70% of cats surrendered to the city shelter were declawed declawed cats are generally not adoptable from shelters because of their behavioral and other problems and they are therefore usually euthanized f there are a number of alternatives to onychectomy declawing and flexor tendonectomy that involve no physical harm to the animal harmless alternatives include training the pet to use a scratch post use of deterrent pheromone sprays covering furniture restricting the pets access to certain areas of the home use of plastic nail covers and more g in addition to the harm these procedures cause to cats they also have detrimental consequences for humans declawing unnecessarily increases public health and safety risks research indicates that a substantial number of declawed cats become more prone to biting as a form of defense  sterling codifiers inc  209797 research has also shown that declawed cats tend to avoid use of litter boxes because the rough surface hurts their paws and this causes sanitation problems h considering the wide array of alternatives the city council finds that the mere convenience of the onychectomy declawing andor flexor tendonectomy procedures to the pets guardian does not justify the unnecessary pain anguish and permanent disability caused to the animal i the city of beverly hills enacts this article pursuant to the authority vested in the city by article xi section 7 of the california constitution allowing a city to make and enforce within its limits all local police sanitary and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws at present the law of the state of california does not prohibit the city from acting to prohibit onychectomy and flexor tendonectomy and therefore the city is not preempted by business and professions from adopting this article see also california veterinary medical assn v city of west hollywood 152 calapp4th 536 2007 court of appeal held that the city of west hollywoods ordinance prohibiting onychectomy and flexor tendonectomy was within the citys police power to prevent animal cruelty and such an ordinance was not preempted by state law j the city council finds that prohibiting these procedures will protect and promote the general health safety and welfare of cats and humans alike o2573 eff 12182009 52602

finds that the scale and massing of buildings in the central r1 zone is of concern to the community at large beverly hills residential neighborhoods have traditionally been renowned for their beauty quality and value and provide the citys residents with an unparalleled quality of life the characteristics are the product of generous setbacks gracious architecture and careful attention to detail however since the late 1980s emerging trends have led some owners and developers in residential areas to disregard prevailing styles and neighborhood character in an effort to maximize development and density the council finds that this trend has led to homes that greatly overpower the general local lot to house size ratio mansionization the mansionization of the citys residential neighborhoods poses a serious danger that such overbuilding will degrade and depreciate the character image beauty and reputation of the citys residential neighborhoods with adverse consequences for the quality of life of all residents the bulk and mass of such homes as well as their general appearances affect the desirability of the immediate area and neighboring areas for residential purposes and by so doing impair the benefits of occupancy of existing property in such areas impair the stability in value of both improved and unimproved real property in such areas prevent the most appropriate development of such areas produce undesirable conditions affecting the health safety comfort and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city and destroy the proper relationship between the taxable value of

this article is to establish development standards for the installation and maintenance of antennas and wireless antenna facilities within specified areas of the city these standards are intended to ensure that the design and location of those antennas and facilities are consistent with previously adopted policies of the city including the citys master telecommunications plan to promote the public health safety comfort convenience and general welfare of the citys residents and to enhance the aesthetic quality and appearance of the city by maintaining architectural and structural integrity and by protecting views and vistas from obtrusive and unsightly accessory uses and facilities b in adopting and implementing the regulatory provisions of this article it is the intent of the city council to further the objectives specified in subsection a of this section without unnecessarily burdening the federal interests in ensuring access to satellite services in promoting fair and effective competition among competing communications service providers and in eliminating local restrictions and regulations that with regard to antennas preclude reception of an acceptable signal
