alabama 197 authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of madison alabama does ordain as follows  11222010 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of madison alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  11222010 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  b restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  c control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion and  d prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  e control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  11222010 objectives the objectives of this article are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  c to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  d to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  e to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  f to minimize prolonged business interruptions and  g to ensure

is there any other reason that recreation impact should not be mitigated eg doing so would conflict with another important public purpose if no to all above continue if yes to any one waive requirement 2 does sufficient recreational opportunity already exist a is there a park or a school with recreational facilities within one mile radially of every proposed unit yes  go to 2bno  go to 3 b if so are the total number of acres of public recreational land in a onemile radial area centered on the project equal to at least three per 1000 potential residents in the area draw a onemile radius circle centered on the project project buildout population in the circle based on current zoning exclude existing residents with access to private recreation facilities comparable to city standards allow 18% for rightofway for any area that has not been subdivided determine total available public recreation land in the circle if there are at least three acres per 1000 potential population stop if not proceed to next step 3 what is the impact of the development a based on the preliminary plat or site plan how many units are planned for the project if under 60 single family detached or 93 multifamily units standards yield less than 05 ac required donation and impact shall be deemed insignificant no dedication required if not continue to 3b 52 b if preliminary plat or site plan contains more than 59 single family or 92 multifamily units calculate donation at 3 ac1000 residents of project use household size of 28 for single family detached 18 for multifamily 4 size threshold  potential assembly of future land a if donation is to be required is it at least 2 acres see answer to 3b above is there suitable access either by a public street or by public access easement if yes to both require donation the planning commission may require in order to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools parks playgrounds or other nearby roads perpetual unobstructed easements or public rightsofway at least ten 10 feet in width easements shall be indicated on the plat location to be chosen by developerlandowner subject to planning commission approval if it is not possible to provide adequate access proceed to 4b b can a location be found where adjacent land is available adjacent for future assembly into larger parcel to qualify adjacent land must be vacant environmentally acceptable zoned residential including residual land zoned rc1 or rc2 but excluding land enjoying any vested development rights and otherwise suitable for park development in the opinion of the director of parks and recreation if no stop  no dedication required if yes require donation adjacent to such suitable parcel if there is more than one suitable parcel developer may decide on location of dedication subject to approval of the planning commission the developer or builder of any project for which a site plan certificate is required shall be required to submit sufficient information to the staff to permit a determination pursuant to these regulations the developer or builder of any project for which a site plan certificate is required may voluntarily
