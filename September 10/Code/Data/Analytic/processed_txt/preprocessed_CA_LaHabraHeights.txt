general plan this the zone districts and specifies the primary uses accessory uses conditional uses temporary uses and prohibited uses within each zone district the following zone districts are established a ra zone residentialagricultural zone b osc zone open spaceconservation zone c osr zone open spacerecreation zone d osrp zone open spaceresource production zone e pf zone public facilities zone f spo zone specific plan overlay zone g io zone institutional overlay zone  ra zone residentialagricultural zone this section establishes the land uses that are permitted in the ra zone a primary uses property in ra zone may be used for the following 1 singlefamily dwellings 2 agricultural activities trees and nursery stock this does not permit roadside stands retail sale from the premises or advertising signs of any nature 3 equestrian pedestrian and bicycle trails b accessory uses property in ra zone may be used for accessory uses indicated in this section in conjunction with a lawfully established singlefamily residence 1 keeping of large animals and small animals with issuance of an animal keeping permit permit application procedures are identified in  home

entertainment and recreational uses such as swimming pools barbeque areas gazebos jacuzzis and other amenities excluding sports courts 4 guesthouses without kitchens are permitted if total floor area is no more than six hundred and forty 640 square feet in the event the quarters are detached the lot shall contain a minimum of fortythree thousand five hundred sixty 43560 square feet and the structure shall be located not less than twenty 20 feet from the residence 5 nonhabitable structures such as studios workshops secondary garages and barns are permitted these structures shall be located not less than ten 10 feet from the residence c conditional uses a conditional use permit is required for the following uses andor activities conditional use permit requirements are identified

temporary uses a temporary use permit is required for the following uses andor activities temporary use permit requirements are identified in  temporary buildings storage yards or trailers used as part of an approved construction project 2 yard and garage sales at private residences up to two 2 times in any calendar year 3 any other similar use that the community development director determines is temporary in nature and provided that the use is found not to be detrimental to surrounding neighborhood e prohibited uses uses not specifically allowed in the ra zone are prohibited such uses include but are not limited to the following 1 second units second units on ra zoned singlefamily lots are prohibited within the city for the reasons set forth below a lack of sewers the city of la habra heights has no citywide sanitary sewer system the sewage effluent of ninetyseven 97 percent of the residential structures in the city is disposed of into cesspools and leach lines which enter the earth strata and percolate into the soil the usage of these sewage disposal systems is predicated on the fact that the city has very low density due to the fact that the majority of lots are one 1 acre or larger which limits the level of risk on the amount of effluent entering the earth strata in the city but which limit could be exceeded by the addition of second units b rural street design the roadways in la habra heights are generally curvy and narrow eighteen 18 feet of paving in many locations with no curbs gutters street lights or sidewalks many streets are private and unimproved or not improved to public street standards in many instances equestrian and pedestrian use is made of shoulders directly adjacent to the roadway paving roadways in the city are generally long and narrow with lengthy culdesacs one way in and out virtually all city streets have no provisions for any onstreet parking the current capacity and design of the roadways cannot withstand the increased traffic congestion and parking requirements associated with increased densities c public transportation and access there is no means of public transportation within the city and no convenient access to essential shopping facilities the addition of second units in the city would therefore generate increased traffic beyond the capacity of the citys roadway network d utilization of existing dwelling units the existing dwelling units in la habra heights are not underutilized nor overcrowded as is evidenced by the 1980 us census which indicated that the average number of persons per dwelling unit in the city is three point two 32 the average number of bedrooms per dwelling unit is three point two 32 and the vacancy rate is four point seven 47 percent the city of la habra heights acknowledges that the preclusion of second units in la habra heights may limit housing opportunities in the region this limitation is justified however by the unusual circumstances described in this section given the relatively small number of singlefamily residences located within the city this preclusion will not significantly affect housing opportunities in the region 2 gates or guardhouses that restrict

pursuant to this  exh a  sustainability as the push for developers to build green facilities continues to increase and as technology for wireless telecommunication facilities is constantly advancing it is expected that design of green telecommunication facilities will be introduced as a design alternative in the near future it is possible that new facilities that are proposed using green technology would not fall within the strict guidelines of this accommodate these facilities the city may consider factors such as whether the facility has no carbon footprint andor whether the facility produces power or wind generated means these proposed facilities shall require a conditional use permit and will be reviewed on a casebycase basis and may be permitted to stray from the specific design requirements of this it is found that the benefit to be found by being green outweighs the potential negative impacts of not meeting all requirements of this planning commission shall
