are allowed in redwood city collectives are not listed as permitted or conditional uses and therefore are currently prohibited by omission but a clear policy statement whether and to what extent collectives are either allowed or not allowed is preferred 5 in cities that have permitted medical marijuana collectives issues and concerns have arisen related to the establishment of medical marijuana collectives in close proximity to residential properties schools and day care facilities furthermore those cities have reported increases in loitering illegal drug activity burglaries robberies and other criminal activity within and around the collectives as well as increased pedestrian and vehicular traffic noise and parking violations medical marijuana collectives andor dispensaries have also resulted in increased demands for police response as well as maintenance of public streets and sidewalks 6 the use possession cultivation or distribution of marijuana for any purpose remains illegal under federal law 7 there are several open questions of state law regarding the regulation of medical marijuana collectives including how to interpret the state attorney

medical marijuana collectives city staff needs time to study the legality potential adverse community impacts and mechanisms for regulating medical marijuana collectives 9 if medical marijuana

a variance is for floodplain management purposes only the variance criteria set forth in this are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to specific parcels of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or to surrounding properties the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the responsibility of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding the need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  1102005  12615 editors note  adopted  renumbered art vi

other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases the risk to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san mateo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affect parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency g variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this  to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances h variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of
