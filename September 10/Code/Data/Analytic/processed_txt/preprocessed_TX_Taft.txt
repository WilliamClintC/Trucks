pertained to similar subject matter and derived from adopted  state law reference local governments must adopt ordinances necessary for jurisdiction to qualify for national flood insurance program vtca water   political subdivisions to comply with federal requirements vtca water article i  in general statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act vtca water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows  10112016 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  10112016 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  10112016 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  10112016 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is

achieving compliance with maintenance andor wastewater discharge limitations 3 sizing requirements a sizing methods described herein are intended as guidance in determining grease trapinterceptor sizes that will afford the citys sanitary sewer system potw a minimum degree of protection against grease and other obstructing materials sizing determinations are based on operational data provided by business owners or their contractors in approving a customers plumbing or grease interceptor design the city does not accept liability for the failure of a system to adequately treat wastewater to achieve effluent quality requirements specified under this article it is the responsibility of the generator andor contractors to insure the appropriate level of treatment necessary for compliance with environmental and wastewater regulations b minimum acceptable grease trapinterceptor sizing shall be accomplished as follows 1 sizing according to formulas found in subsection b4 of this section 2 where sizing formulas result in determination of a grease trap less than 750 gallons in capacity this minimum size is recommended however under no circumstances should exterior grease traps less than 500 gallons be utilized 3 in the circumstance of single service kitchens with no food preparation heatserve only and which use paper service items a minimum 50gallon per minute gpm flow rated or 100pound grease retention mechanical grease trap may be used in these instances the grease trap is to be installed separate from food handling area and the trap must be readily accessible for cleaning and maintenance see subsection b6 of this section 4 grease trap sizing formulas it is the responsibility of the generator and hisher contractors to ensure that the wastewater discharged from their facility is in compliance with the citys discharge limitations for the purpose of plans review a general assessment of grease trapinterceptor design and size will be performed using the following
