that facility in addition a larger meter may be required in areas of low water pressure than in areas of normal water pressure for the same type of use in those cases it is the policy of the city that the impact fee for water and wastewater should be based on the meter size needed by that facility for its typical usage without regard to fireflow or unusual pressure conditions 5 irrigation any

health safety and general welfare to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development activities and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in identified special flood hazard areas this ordinance advances the stated purpose designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 protect natural floodplains against unwise development  3 eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development  4 protect restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources  5 reduce pollutants in surface waters by filtering settling and transforming pollutants in runoff  6 stabilize the banks of streams to reduce erosion and the downstream transport of sediment and nutrients  7 maintain tree canopy to shade streams reduce water temperatures promote desirable aquatic organisms resulting in ecological integrity with improved fishing greater scenic value and recreational opportunity  8 minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects  9 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  10 minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events  11 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  12 minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base  13 provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special flood hazard area  14 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions b this ordinance uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose 1 this ordinance restricts or prohibits structures or uses in special flood hazard areas that adversely impact health safety or property during flooding events  2 this ordinance requires protection against flood damage for structures or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction or after substantial improvement of the structure or after substantial damage has occurred  3 this ordinance controls the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation and transport of flood waters  4 this ordinance controls floodplain development structural development placement of manufactured structures clearing grading mining drilling dredging placement of fill excavating watercourse alteration drainage improvements roadway or bridge construction individual water or sewer installations and other activities which may increase flood damage by increasing flood elevations flood water velocities or flood discharge patterns  5

intent of this chapter to protect maintain and enhance the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of fayetteville by 1 preventing increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater runoff to prevent increases in flood flows and associated hazards and costs 2 controlling soil erosion and sedimentation to minimize soil deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies and storm drainage systems 3 requiring surface and stormwater management practices that comply with requirements of this chapter 4 promoting the development of stormwater facilities that are aesthetically desirable b findings of fact the city council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health safety and welfare because 1 impervious surfacesrunoff impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff which reduces percolation of water increases erosion and flooding 2 collection and conveyance of stormwater improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding which can endanger property and human life 3 erosion  increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems which decreases the systems capacity 4 future problems many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound

purpose some of the existing natural site features typically protected use of lid techniques are wetlands floodplains forested areas hillsides riparian corridors and existing soils there are a variety of lid design alternatives that allow professionals in the land development field the flexibility to implement lid stormwater design elements the various lid practices can be used alone or in series to maximize benefits to the site in most cases some type of structural drainage systems will also be required to be implemented in conjunction with lid element a objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to establish criteria by which a lid strategy can be measured and implemented of the criteria in the lid chapter of the drainage criteria manual 2 to strive to maintain and restore natural rainwater absorption and infiltration processes  3 to strive to maintain predevelopment hydrologic conditions  4 to filter pollutants from stormwater runoff thereby improving water quality and positively impacting the regions lakes streams and groundwater  5 to reduce stormwater runoff intensity and velocity  6 to preserve riparian banks and beds and reduce sedimentation that impairs water quality  7 to promote the widespread use of lid practices integrated with conventional stormwater engineering  8 to protect the safety and welfare of citizens property owners and businesses by minimizing the negative impacts of stormwater discharge from land development b lid principles  1 define and locate critical resource areas during the project planning stage such as  wetlands riparian

impact development lid is a stormwater management strategy concerned with maintaining restoring or replicating the natural hydrologic functions of a site where possible by employing a variety and combination of natural and built features that reduce the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff filter out its pollutants and facilitate the infiltration of water into the ground b site design strategies generally site design strategies will address the arrangement of buildings roads parking areas and other features and the conveyance of stormwater runoff across the site lid site design strategies are intended to complement the natural and built environment while minimizing the generation of runoff site design strategies should address some or all of the following considerations 1 necessary grading and land disturbance should be designed to encourage sheet flow and lengthen stormwater flow paths 2 natural drainage divides should be maintained to keep flow paths dispersed 3 areas of impervious surfaces should be separated and stormwater should be conveyed across vegetated areas this assists runoff filtration and encourages infiltration 4 distribute smallscale lid strategies across the development site in order to maximize benefits 5 to the maximum extent possible treat pollutant loads where they are generated 6 preserve naturally vegetated areas and soil types that slow runoff filter pollutants and facilitate infiltration 7 lid systems and structures should be integrated into the natural and built landscape with attention to flow paths infiltration areas and the use of appropriate native plant materials c site design elements in addition to water quality impacts lid site design elements when successfully implemented perform three 3 necessary functions
