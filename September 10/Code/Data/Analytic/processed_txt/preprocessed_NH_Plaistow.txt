preface the town of plaistow has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many american communities while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the town subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modem life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the town the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the town meeting ordered the following codification of the towns legislation  contents of various chapters of the all currently effective ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the town meeting and board of selectmen as well as certain rules and regulations adopted by the planning board which were deemed to be general and permanent in nature and appropriate for inclusion in the volume division of divided into parts contains ordinances adopted by the town meeting and board of selectmen contains rules and regulations adopted by the planning board grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the various items of legislation are organized into chapters their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in in the chapter entitled streets and sidewalks in such chapters use of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation  table of contents the table of contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation   reserved chapters space has been provided in the the convenient insertion alphabetically of later enactments in the table of contents such space appears as chapters entitled reserved in the body of the reserved space is provided by breaks in the pagenumbering sequence between chapters pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit one hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals  thus begins on  on  etc by use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of is  61 while the fourth section of is  534 new sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system thus for example if two sections were to be added between  534 and 535 they would be numbered as  5341 and 5342  scheme the scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text histories at the end of the scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived including the enactment number eg ordinance number local law number bylaw number resolution number etc if pertinent and the date of adoption in the case of chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation the source of each part or article is indicated in the text under its title amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text general references  editors notes in each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the a table of general references is included to direct the readers attention to such related chapters editors notes  ii are used in the text to provide supplementary information and crossreferences to related provisions in other chapters appendix certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the are of such significance that their application is communitywide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government the appendix of this reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include disposition list the disposition list is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication of the indicating its inclusion in the the reason for its exclusion the disposition list will be updated with each supplement to the include the legislation reviewed with said supplement index the index is a guide to information since it is likely that this be used by persons without formal legal training the index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly each section of each chapter has been indexed the index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the for amending the changes to the whether they are amendments deletions or complete new additions should be adopted as amending the doing so existing material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered adding new sections where new sections are to be added to a chapter they can be added at the end of the existing material continuing the numbering sequence or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers eg a new section between 655 and 656 should be designated 6551 adding new chapters new chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence utilizing the reserved chapter numbers new chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical listing eg new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled vehicles abandoned under v in the table of contents and a new enactment on coinoperated amusement devices should be amusement devices or amusement devices coinoperated under a in the table of contents where a reserved number is not available an a chapter should be used eg a new chapter to be included between chapters 166 and 167 should be designated  adding new articles new articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter eg adding a new district to the zoning regulations by the use of a articles eg a new iii article to be included between articles xvi and xvii should be designated  the section numbers would be as indicated above eg if the new contains six sections and existing ends with 16630 and begins with 16631 should contain  166301  note in chapters where articles appear on the table of contents simply add new articles to the end of the chapter since they are not arranged by subject matter supplementation supplementation of the follow the adoption of new legislation new legislation or amendments to existing legislation
