thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note   the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the

one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep its course and speed 2 the latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by its maneuver alone as soon as it becomes apparent to it that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with this chapter b when from any cause the vessel required to keep its course and speed finds itself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giveway vessel alone it shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision c a powerdriven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with subsection a 2 hereof to avoid collision with another powerdriven vessel shall if the circumstances of the case admit not alter course to port for a vessel

innovations in land development that are consistent with the citys development and planning policies and which would not otherwise be permitted in the residential or commercial districts pursuant to this zoning athe regulations for planned developments provide flexibility in uses densities and dwelling types as well as in the design and placement of buildings in order to achieve the following objectives 1encourage a mix of complementary land uses based on the size of the development and relationship to surrounding uses to create economic vitality 2encourage skillful planning while promoting coordinated architectural design within a unified development area 3promote greater efficiency in the use of land and reduce infrastructure costs development 4encourage developments that respect and incorporate into the project the unique characteristics and natural qualities of the site and surrounding area to enhance the development protect the communitys natural resources and environmentally sensitive areas and the appearance of the city 5create desirable public and private common open spaces while maximizing the development potential of individual sites 6respect the character of surrounding developments by providing appropriate buffers as a transition to areas of different land uses and development densities bthe regulations for planned developments establish design criteria to ensure that the development project creates interesting places and walkable districts with buildings of extraordinary quality and design properly integrated into its surroundings
