management policy access to streets and highways a roadway network consists of several classifications of roadways each with a different traffic mobility function and commensurate inverse level of access to property roadway classes with higher levels of mobility function are necessarily designed to lower levels of access function to minimize conflicts associated with slow moving turning vehicles roadways are generally classified as freeways arterials collectors and local streets 1 freeways are designed to provide the highest level of mobility and to carry the greatest volume of traffic at the highest safe speeds accordingly freeway main lanes provide no direct access to property and access to the freeway main lanes is provided only at interchanges and ramps designed to minimize the disruption of the mobility function 2 arterials generally provide mobility across long distances at lower speeds and provide access at lesser arterials or major collector streets 3 collectors provide a more even balance between mobility and access and are intended to carry lower volumes of traffic at lower speeds since most of the trips on collectors are shorter distance local trips these streets can safely provide a higher level of access to local streets 4 local streets provide the lowest level of mobility and are intended to provide direct access to properties preserve

granted under the state constitution and the state statutes including but not by way of limitation vtca local government et seq    212018 it is hereby declared by the city commission that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into a procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city and its etj whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing property for increased residential use 2 neighborhood parks are those parks providing a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of residences to be served thereby the primary cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks shall be the primary

by a plat filed for approval the landowner shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount provided by subsection d3 of this section rather than to dedicate any land area no plat showing a dedication of less than one acre shall be approved 3 in instances where an area of more than one acre of park land is to be dedicated the city shall have the right to accept the land dedication for approval of the final plat or to refuse the same after consideration of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board and to require

development or if the recreation potential for that park zone would be better served by expanding or improving existing parks 4 the dedication required by this section shall be made upon filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instrument unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat as follows if the actual number of completed dwelling units exceed the figure upon which the original dedication was based such additional dedication shall be made by the current landowner by payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount provided by subsection

city does purchase park land the city shall have the right to require payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount set forth in subsection d3 of this section for all subsequent residential development near the subject park provided that the fees assessed do not exceed the citys actual cost of acquisition and development of the park and the citys actual cost of the provision of adjacent streets and utilities if applicable once the city has been reimbursed entirely for all such costs for that park this section shall cease to apply and the other sections of this section shall again be applicable 3 to the extent that other sections of this section require the dedication requirement shall be met by a payment in lieu of land set from time to time by ordinance of the city commission sufficient to acquire and develop land and to provide adjacent streets and utilities for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which such development is located unless changed by the city commission such price shall be computed on the basis of a $40000 perlot for r1 r3 and m1 districts and  b $25000 perdwelling unit for any apartment or multifamily use cash payments may be only used

considered to be spent on a firstin firstout basis if not so expended the owners of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rate refund of such sum computed on the same basis as is called for in subsection d2 of this section the owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement in writing or such right shall be barred f additional requirements  definitions 1 any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses the following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable a any area primarily located in the 100year floodplain  b any areas of unusual topography slope or shape which renders the same unsuitable for organized recreational activities such characteristics of a park land dedication site may be grounds for refusal of any preliminary plat 2 drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the drainage is constructed in accordance with city engineering
