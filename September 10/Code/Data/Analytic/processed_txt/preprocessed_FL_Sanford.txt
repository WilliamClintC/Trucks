footnotes  1  editors note the charter of the city of sanford adopted by the city commission on  approved by the voters of the city on  is set out herein state law reference municipal home rule powers fs ch 166 article i  powers of the city powers of the city the city of sanford florida shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the constitution and laws of this state as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this charter construction the powers of the city under this charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers stated in this article intergovernmental relations the city may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof jointly or in cooperation by contract or otherwise with any one or more states or civil divisions or agencies thereof or the united states or any agency thereof description of corporate limits the corporate limits of the city of sanford florida shall be those in effect on the date this charter is ratified by the voters of the city of sanford and said corporate limits may be amended by ordinance annexation the territorial boundaries of the city of sanford may be extended as provided by general acts laws of florida article ii  city commission footnotes  2  a the city staff report and city commission agenda memorandum relating to this matter can be relied upon to facilitate the understanding of the legislative intent relating to the provisions of this b the city of sanford has complied with all requirements and procedures of florida law in processing and advertising this c recent changes in federal law pertaining to elections the military and overseas voter empowerment act the move act public law 111  84 which is part of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 have potentially impacted the operations of local government election officials beginning with the november 2010 general elections state election officials are now required to send ballots to overseas citizens 45 days before an election except under emergency circumstances and election officials must also make blank ballots available electronically either by fax email or internet download these legal requirements could affect the elections of the city of sanford in a potentially significant manner in that although the move act relates to federal elections the general principle of law is that overseas citizens should warrant respect of their franchise in all elections the 45day period referenced above would in actuality be of necessity a 60day period in that certification of the election is a 12day process and thus although the city would normatively schedule a runoff election within weeks of the general election  the 60day period between the general election and the runoff is problematic 2 florida statutes provides that the governing body of a municipality such as the city commission may by ordinance  change the dates for qualifying and for the election of members of the governing body of the municipality and provide for the orderly transition of office resulting from such date changes 4 florida statutes also states in pertinent part that  nothing in this act shall be construed to permit any changes in a special law or municipal charter which affect the exercise of extraterritorial powers or which affect an area which includes lands within and without a municipality or any changes in a special law or municipal charter which affect  the terms of elected officers and the manner of their election except for the selection of election dates and qualifying periods for candidates and for changes in terms of office necessitated by such changes in election dates  without approval by referendum of the electors as provided in fs   emphasis added both the language in 4 florida statutes and 2 florida statutes were added to state statutory law by the florida legislature when it enacted laws of florida and the attorney general of the state of florida has issued several opinions relative to related legal issues and stated in attorney general opinion ago number 200947 dated  to kevin d obos springfield city attorney that in considering the 1995 legislation this office has stated that an examination of the legislative history reflects an intent that municipalities would be authorized to amend their charters to change the election dates and qualifying periods for candidates including any changes in terms of office necessitated by the amendment without a referendum in ago 200947 the attorney general concluded that the city of springfield may by the same referendum amend its charter to change the terms of elected officers from two years to four years and extend the terms of the currently elected mayor and two of the commissioners by one additional year prior to ago 200947 the attorney general issued ago number 200352 dated  issued to james c brady on behalf of the mayor and city commission of the city of lauderdale lakes and stated that accordingly i am of the opinion that the city of lauderdale lakes pursuant to sections 4 and  florida statutes may amend its city charter by ordinance to move the dates of city elections from march to november to coincide with federal state and county elections and to extend the terms of the sitting commissioners to november when the existing charter was last amended in january 1998 in ago number 200061 dated  issued to mr frank comparetto jr mulberry city attorney the attorney general opined that pursuant to section  florida statutes the city of mulberry may by ordinance amend its city charter to move the dates of city elections from april to november to coincide with federal state and county elections and to extend the terms of the sitting commissioners to november it is thus well settled in florida law that the city commission has the power to adjust periods of qualifying for office and the associated terms of office composition terms and eligibility a city commission the local governing body of the city shall be a city commission consisting of a mayor who shall also be known as a commissioner and either four 4 or six 6 city commissioners in number as determined by ordinance enacted by the city

quality of life in the community and should be allowed to continue at reasonable levels with moderate regulation 4 each person has a right to an environment reasonably free from noise which jeopardizes health welfare or unnecessarily degrades the quality of life 5 it is the policy of this city to promote an environment free from excessive noise otherwise properly called noise pollution which unnecessarily jeopardizes the health and welfare and degrades the quality of the lives of the residents of this community without unduly prohibiting limiting or otherwise regulating the function of certain noiseproducing equipment which is not amenable to such controls and yet is essential to the economy and quality of life of the community  6 8252008 purpose the purpose of this article is to

either 1 a state or federal agency has adopted a different standard or rule than that prescribed within this article and has so preempted the regulation of noise from a particular source as to render this article inapplicable thereto  or 2 the city commission has determined that because of public acceptance of the activity producing a particular noise such noise is deemed acceptable to the city residents  10 8252008 exceptions to article this article shall not apply to the following 1 the emission of sound for the purpose of alerting persons to the existence of an emergency 2 the emission of

citys interest to encourage the proper operation and maintenance and continued existence of fire suppression systems or construction of buildings that are otherwise designed to be more fire resistant due to unique building construction because the city receives benefits from the reduction in the need for fire flow in the form of reduced costs i the amount of the credit for parcels with buildings with a properly designed functioning and fully automated fire suppression system or contain buildings that are otherwise designed to be more fire resistant due to unique building construction is determined by the ratio of the reduction to the total water supply requirements between ordinary construction versus noncombustible construction 20 percent and the ratio of the reduction to the total fire impact fee requirements between noncombustible construction versus fire resistive construction 20 percent  4222013 footnotes    the international organization for standardization is the worlds

associated with physical improvements on the land or for the design of specific buildings and improvements to be constructed on the site  9 the extent to which the applicant has secured building permits for and commenced in whole or in part but not completed the construction of physical improvements on the land utility infrastructure or other public improvements or buildings germane to a phased development that was contemplated to extend over a period of months or years  10 whether the applicant prior to or on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation has made contractual commitments to complete structures and deliver titles thereto or occupancy thereof and the dates of and amounts of money involved in those commitments  11 whether prior to or on the date of notice of change in a land development regulation for the currently effective comprehensive plan land development code or applicable section of either document the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution which despite a thorough review of alternative solutions the applicant will be unable to meet or it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet unless he is permitted to proceed with the previously permitted specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development  12 whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or land development code regulation will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons or will leave the applicant completely unable after thorough review of alternative solutions to earn a reasonable return on hisher investment in the property  13 whether the right of the applicant to commence maintain and complete the proposed development or a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development has been vested only with respect to an identifiable and discreet portion of the applicants property  and 14 any other information relevant to understanding the applicants claim to vested rights to develop hisher real property in a particular manner that may be pertinent under state or federal law 0 8112008 demonstration of vested rights the right of the applicant to commence maintain or complete construction of a development or to a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of

and legally permitted at that time  2 the applicant has continuously owned the parcel of real property since the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city commission on the special permit application  3 the most current legislated city comprehensive plan or land development code or portion thereof cited by the applicant as being counter to the applicants vested right to commence maintain and complete construction of a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development has a material and adverse effect upon the applicants vested right to develop the subject parcel or continue the use of real property as contemplated  4 by application of the considerations set out in section 74218 the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position it has an investmentbacked expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence maintain and complete a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development upon all or a portion of the applicants parcel of real property  and 5 the requirement that the applicants property be developed in accordance with the currently effective city comprehensive plan or city land development code will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on hisher investment or effectuate a substantial change in position given the substantial change in position of the applicant or the creation of an investmentbacked expectation prior to or on the date on which the most current city comprehensive plan or land development code was subject to a notice of a change in determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return the following categories of expenditures shall not be included in the calculation of the applicants investment a expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design

action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection a3 of this section are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and c the user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  2 the

discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 102271 with the exception of section 1022711 3 and 14 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypasses 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections c3 and 4 of this section 3 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the city at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible a user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the city may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 bypass is prohibited and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c3 of this section the city may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection 4

commission has determined and recognized of this article and prior impact fee ordinances that new growth and development which the city will experience will necessitate extensive improvements capital facilities and infrastructure including water and sewer systems and plants in order to finance the necessary new capital improvements several combined methods of financing shall be employed one of which will impose a regulatory impact fee on new growth and development which does not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs of the capital expenditures required to serve future growth and new development by providing for needed plant capacity and infrastructure additions b implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay an impact fee that does not exceed the reasonably anticipated capital costs incurred to serve new growth and development is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the policy and intent of its comprehensive plan as amended and adopted under fs   et seq and is in the best interest of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city c the purpose of this article is to enable the city to allow growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the comprehensive plan and to regulate growth and development so as to require growth and development to share in the burdens of growth by paying for the reasonably anticipated capital costs attributable to growth and new development d it is not the purpose of this article to collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the reasonably anticipated capital requirements needed to serve the new growth and development the city commission hereby finds that this article has approached the problem of determining impact fees in a conservative and reasonable manner this article will result in only partial recoupment of the capital expenditures attributable to future growth and new development impact fees will not be utilized to

thereof dates of expenditures  or incurrence of the obligation to incur expenditures acts committed which represent a change in position and dates thereof  g the good faith of the applicant in substantially changing hisher position or the incurring of extensive obligations and expenses based upon the citys actions or omissions to act  h any legally permitted acts of the applicant and the specific dates thereof associated with physical improvements on the land or for the design of specific buildings and improvements to be constructed on the site  i the extent to which the applicant has secured building permits for and commenced in whole or in part but not completed the construction of physical improvements on the land utility infrastructure or other public improvements or buildings germane to a phased development that was contemplated to extend over a period of months or years  j whether the applicant prior to or on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation

the date of notice of change in a land development regulation for the currently effective comprehensive plan land development regulations or applicable section of either document the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution which despite a thorough review of alternative solutions the applicant will be unable to meet or it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet unless he is permitted to proceed with the previously permitted specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development  l whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or land development code regulation will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons or will leave the applicant completely unable after thorough review of alternative solutions to earn a reasonable return on hisher investment in the property  m whether the right of the applicant to commence maintain and complete the proposed development or a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development has been vested only with respect to an identifiable and discreet portion of the applicants property

2 the right of the applicant to commence maintain or complete construction of a development or to a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development on hisherits parcel of real property or a portion thereof is vested if the applicant can demonstrate that a the applicant owned the parcel of real property proposed to be developed on the date of notice of a change in a

time  b the applicant has continuously owned the parcel of real property since the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city commission on the special permit application  c the most current legislated city comprehensive plan or land development regulations or portion thereof cited by the applicant as being counter to the applicants vested right to commence maintain and complete construction of a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development has a material and adverse effect upon the applicants vested right to develop the subject parcel or continue the use of real property as contemplated  d by application of the considerations set out in this section the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position it has an investmentbacked expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence maintain and complete a specific level type nature density intensity or other form of development upon all or a portion of the applicants parcel of real property  and e the requirement that the applicants property be developed in accordance with the currently effective city comprehensive plan or land development regulations will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on hisher investment or effectuate a substantial change in position given the substantial change in position of the applicant or the creation of an investmentbacked expectation prior to or

corridors a purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the city of sanford proportionate fairshare program or pfsp as required by and in a manner consistent with fs  16 b legislative findings 1 transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city 2 transportation capacity is an integral part of the pfsp 3 the pfsp provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors 4 the pfsp allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of a transportation facility 5 the pfsp contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  6 the pfsp maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element cie c applicability the pfsp shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the citys concurrency management system cms including transportation facilities maintained by fdot or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations pursuant to the requirements of subsection f the pfsp does not apply to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate fairshare under fs  12 or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in the citys comprehensive plan objective 218 transportation concurrency exception area and objective 814

the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the citys comprehensive plan and all applicable land development regulations b the citys fiveyear capital improvement program cip or the longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms includes a transportation improvements that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development 2 the city may allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency pfsp by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the cms where one of the following apply a the city adopts by resolution a commitment to add the improvement to the fiveyear cip in the cie of the citys comprehensive plan or the longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms no later than the next regular update to qualify for consideration under this subsection the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city commission or its designee and must be determined to be financially feasible consistent with the citys comprehensive plan and in compliance with the provisions of this section financial feasibility means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities b if the funds in the adopted fiveyear cip are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the cms the city may require a proportionate fairshare payment for another improvement which will the city determines will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the fiveyear cip of the citys comprehensive plan at the next annual cie update 3 any improvement project proposed to meet a developers fairshare obligation must meet generally accepted design standards of the jurisdiction that has responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the transportation facility e application process 1 upon

schools permanent florida inventory of school houses fish meaning the permanent facilities within the inventory of land buildings and rooms in public educational facilities used by the florida department of education office of educational facilities  and concurrency service area csa a geographic unit promulgated by the school board and adopted by local governments within which the level of service is measured when an application for residential development is reviewed for school concurrency purposes the csa coincides with groupings of school attendance zones within each school type based on adjacency level of service los standard a standard established to measure utilization of capacity within a concurrency service area csa current los within a csa is determined by dividing the fulltime equivalent student count fte for the fall semester at the same type of schools by the permanent fish capacity of the same type of schools projected or future los is determined by the dividing the projected enrolled students at the same type of schools within a csa by the planned permanent fish capacity of the same type of schools b use of concurrency service area csa boundaries the city shall apply school concurrency using csa boundaries adopted by the school board the csas are described geographically in maps 13 of the support documents of the comprehensive plan and may be updated from time to time by the school board c csas for each type of school the csa boundaries established by the school board will be based on clustered attendance zones for each school type elementary middle and high school based on adjacency and will be reevaluated by the school board as needed d development review process the city shall withhold or condition the approval of any site plan final subdivision or functional equivalent for new residential units not exempted from concurrency until a school capacity availability letter determination scald has been issued by the school board to the

consistent with the methodology below i proportionate share mitigation in the event there is not available school capacity to support a development the school board may entertain proportionate share mitigation options and if accepted shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the developer to mitigate the impact from the development creation of additional school capacity proportionate share mitigation allows a developer to pay that portion of the cost of providing capacity in a school facility that is necessary to serve that particular development or redevelopment project 1 when the anticipated student impacts from a proposed development cause the adopted los to be exceeded the developers proportionate share will be based on the number of additional student stations necessary to achieve the established los the amount to be paid will be calculated by the cost per student station for elementary middle and high school as determined and published by the state of florida 2 the methodology used to calculate a developers proportionate share mitigation shall be as follows proportionate share    1 development students  available capacity x 2 total cost per student station where 1 development students   those students from the development that are assigned to a csa and have triggered a deficiency of the available capacity 2 total cost   the cost per student station as determined and published by the state of florida 3 the applicant shall be allowed to enter a 90day negotiation period with the school board in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development creation of additional capacity upon identification and acceptance of a mitigation option deemed financially feasible by the school board the developer shall enter into a binding and enforceable development agreement with the school board a a mitigation contribution provided by a developer to offset the impact of a residential development must be directed by the school board toward a school capacity project identified in the school boards fiveyear capital improvement plan capacity enhancing projects identified within the first three years of the fiveyear capital improvement plan shall be considered as committed b if capacity projects are planned in years four or five of the school boards fiveyear capital improvement plan within the same csa as the proposed residential development the developer may pay his proportionate share to mitigate the proposed development c if a capacity project does not exist in the capital improvement plan the school board will add a capacity project to satisfy the impacts from a proposed residential development if it is funded developers proportionate share mitigation contributions mitigation options may include but are not limited to i contribution of land or payment for land acquisition suitable for and in conjunction with the provision of additional school capacity  or ii mitigation banking based on the construction of a educational facility in exchange for the right to sell capacity credits  or iii provide modular or permanent student stations acceptable for use as an educational facilities  or iv provide additional student stations remodeling of existing buildings acceptable for use as an educational facility  or v construction or expansion of permanent student stations at the impacted school within

construct the mitigating capacity will reflect the estimated future construction costs at the time of the anticipated construction improvements contributed by the developer shall receive school impact fee credit 5 developer shall receive an impact fee credit for the proportionate share mitigation credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution was calculated the portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the school type elementary middle high in the appropriate csa impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicants proportionate share obligation is calculated any school impact fee credit based on proportionate fair share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the csa 6 a proportionate share mitigation contribution shall not be subsequently amended or refunded after final site plan or plat approval to reflect a reduction in planned or constructed residential density 7 impact fees shall be credited against the proportionate share mitigation total 8 any proportionate share mitigation must be directed by the school board toward a school capacity improvement identified in the school boards fiveyear capital improvement plan 9 upon conclusion of the negotiation period a second determination letter shall be issued if mitigation is agreed to the school board shall issue a new determination letter approving the development subject to those mitigation measures agreed to by the local government developer and the school board prior to site plan approval final subdivision approval or the

buildings sites and landscapes are not exempt from the ada and must comply with its regulations historic properties often can be made accessible while preserving their architectural character planning and sensitive design a threestep approach is recommended to identify and implement accessibility modifications that will protect the integrity and historic character of historic properties 1 review the historical significance of the property and identify characterdefining features thoroughly inspect and evaluate the character defining features materials and spaces of a property before upgrading it for handicap accessibility significant materials the form and style of the property the principal elevations major architectural and landscape features and the principal public spaces shall be the items identified for preservation 2 assess the propertys existing and required level of accessibility while inspecting a property features materials and spaces of less significance to the historic character of the property shall also be identified nonsignificant spaces secondary pathways additions previous altered areas utilitarian spaces and service areas can usually be modified without threatening or destroying a propertys historical significance 3 evaluate accessibility options within a preservation context modifications for handicap accessibility shall be compatible with the property they shall be in scale with the property visually compatible in terms of their design and materials but be differentiated from the original they shall be reversible so that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the property would be unimpaired congress recognized the national interest in preserving historic properties when it enacted the ada congress established alternative minimum requirements for qualified historic properties that cannot physically be made accessible without threatening or destroying their significance modifications for handicap accessibility shall be compatible with the property and reversible they shall be in scale with the property visually compatible in terms of their design and materials but be differentiated from the original they shall be reversible so that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the property would be unimpaired properties listed in or eligible for listing in the national register of historic places and those designated under state or local law are qualified historic properties owners of qualified historic properties must first consult with the state historic preservation officer shpo before using the alternative minimum requirements if the shpo determines that compliance with the full accessibility requirements would threaten or destroy the significance of a building or facility the following alternative minimum requirements may be used  one accessible route must be provided from a site access point to an accessible entrance using a ramp with a one to six  slope is permissible for a run of up to two feet  one accessible entrance must be provided if it is not possible to make the public entrance accessible then an alternative unlocked entrance is acceptable directional signage at the primary entrance and a notification system at the accessible entrance must be provided  if toilets are provided only one must be accessible and it may be unisex  public spaces on the level of the accessible entrance must be accessible and other public levels shall be accessible whenever practicable  displays and written information shall be located where a seated person can see them horizontal signage shall be no higher then 44 inches above the floor in limited circumstances if it is determined in consultation with the shpo that compliance with the alternative minimum requirements would also threaten or destroy the significance of a historic building alternative methods of access may be used the alternative methods of accessibility that may be used to make a buildings program and activities accessible include  using audiovisual materials and devices to show inaccessible areas of a historic property  assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or areas of a historic property  adopting other innovative methods  3232015 appendix a characteristics of architectural styles commonly found in sanford a frame vernacular 1

concern the development of documentation for historic buildings and structures which are proposed for demolition due to deterioration or the acquisition of a site for new purposes this documentation which usually consists of dimensioned drawings photographs and written data provides important information on a propertys significance for use by scholars researchers historians architects and others interested in preserving and understanding our past types of documentation there are four levels of documentation available for use in recording historic buildings a determined by the historic american building survey habs for most purposes level iii will be acceptable this determination will be made however on a case by case basis by the bureau of historic preservation prior to any actual demolition activity  that is at the time of the request for demolition for those structures not falling within the purview of the bureau the reader is encouraged to use that level of documentation best suited to the structure under consideration level i measured drawings usual depict existing conditions use of a site plan floor plans elevations sections and construction details level ii documentation differs from level i by substituting copies of existing drawings either original or alteration drawings for recently executed measured drawings while existing drawings are rarely as suitable as asbuilt drawings they are adequate in many cases for documentation purposes level iii documentation requires a sketch plan if it helps to explain the structure the architectural data form see attachment a should supplement the photographs by explaining what is not readily visible level iv documentation consists of a habs inventory card and photograph only guidelines for implementing these standards definitions architectural data form see attachment a documentation documentation consists of measured drawings photographs histories inventory cards or other media that depicts historic buildings sites structures or objects field photography photography other than large format intended for the purpose of documentation usually 35 mm field record notes of measurements taken

be drawn on the measured drawings but clearly labeled as not accessible or drawn from available construction drawings or other sources and so identified no part of the measured drawings shall be produced from hypothesis or nonmeasurement related activities documentation level i measured drawings shall be accompanied by a set of filled notebooks in which the measurements were first recorded other drawings prepared for documentations levels ii and iii shall include a statement describing where the original drawings are located large format photographs large format photographs shall clearly depict the appearance of the property and areas of significance of the recorded building site structure or object each view shall be perspective corrected and fully captioned including location of camera and date photo taken written history written history and description for documentation levels i and ii shall be based on primary sources to the greatest extent possible for levels iii and iv secondary sources may provide adequate information  it not primary research will be necessary a frank assessment of the reliability and limitations of sources shall be included within written history statements shall be footnoted as to their sources where appropriate the written data shall include a methodology section specifying name of researcher date of research sources searched and limitations of the project standard iii materials all levels measured drawings readily reproducible ink on translucent material which is archivally stable such as mylar there are two standard sizes for measured drawings 19  24 and 24  36 level iii sketch plans may be on archival bond paper large format photographs readily reproducible prints shall be accompanied by negatives photography must be archivally processed and stored negatives shall be on safety film only neither rosin coated paper nor color film is acceptable there are three sizes which may be used 4  5 5  7 or 8  10
