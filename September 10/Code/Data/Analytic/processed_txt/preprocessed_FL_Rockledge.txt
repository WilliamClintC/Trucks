within the purview of this chapter consideration shall be given to the following quoted excerpts from florida attorney generals opinion number 8545 accordingly you alternatively phrase your first question as an inquiry into the indicia municipal marine patrol officers may look at to assist in determining whether a vessel is a legal residence and thus within the definition of `liveaboard vessel at 13b florida statutes a `legal residence is a location where a person is presently living with the present intention of making it his permanent abode minick v minick 149 so 483 fla 1933  wade v wade 113 so 374 fla 1927 and see walker v harris 398 so 2d 955 958 4 dca fla 1981 stating `a person may have several temporary local residences but can have only one legal residence a legal residence or domicile is the place where a person has fixed an abode with the present intention of making it their sic permanent home see also blacks law dictionary 807 5th ed 1979 defining `legal residence as `permanent fixed place of abode which person intends to be his residence and to which he intends to return despitetemporary absences while subjective intention is the best evidence of `legal residence florida courts have clearly recognized that residence may be established by objective facts as well see brown v brown supra at 383 stating that `residence is a matter of objective fact see also walker v harris supra at 958 stating that although subjective intent is the best proof of domicile `this is not to suggest that proof of legal residence cannot be measured by objective factors therefore i am of the opinion that vessels which are used as a persons primary residence may be `liveaboard vessels for purposes of municipal regulation permitted by 2 fs even though they are not used solely as a residence but are also used for recreational purposes if such vessels are represented as such persons `legal residence pursuant to 13b fs 1984 supp and that the determination of whether such vessels are represented as a persons legal residence may be based on a combination of the persons subjective intent and objective facts however this office ordinarily refrains from resolving questions of fact

6090  shepard park affordable housing overlay district a purpose as a result of the serious workforce housing shortage in brevard county and city of rockledge the city is proposing to use an affordable housing overlay concept to provide additional areas for the construction of housing units for the citys workforce it is hoped that this affordable housing overlay will provide opportunity areas for a variety of housing sponsors nonprofit private forprofit and employerassisted housing providers to develop affordable housing within close proximity to major employment sites within the overlay area the underlying incentives remain in place until the project demonstrates that it can satisfy established criteria with the satisfaction of criteria and project approval the site may then be developed b housing levels within overlay areas new housing units within the affordable housing overlay area are intended to be one hundred 100 percent affordable to the areas workforce they are to be priced at levels affordable to the moderate low and very low income households as defined by us department of housing and urban development and the brevard county housing and human services department criteria the proportion of housing to be built at each level is to reflect the distribution of income levels for the particular area of the city the city is looking for three 3 units being built to meet the needs of thirty 30 percent to fifty 50 percent medium income level  eight 8 units being built to meet the housing needs of fifty 50 percent to eighty 80 percent medium income level  and twentyfive 25 units being built to meet the housing needs of eighty 80 percent to one hundred twenty 120 percent of medium income level infill areas throughout shepard park should be a mixture of all classifications in order to assure longterm affordability of the units the units are to be deed restricted to ensure resale to moderate low and very low income households c area designation the shepard park subdivision area offers the greatest flexibility by all parties to meet the serious shortages in workforce housing the overlay district shall include the area shown in the map attached

overlay area can request that their site be designated as an affordable housing site each site will be evaluated by designated members of city staff to determine its potential to serve as affordable housing site analysis will consider the factors described below the most important factor is the consideration of the suitability of the site to accommodate an affordable workforce housing project in one of the levels stated in subsection b above 1 as a part of the review of the project staff will work with the project applicants to achieve the distribution of units that are needed to meet the areas wage earner household income needs it is recognized that housing types and project design may need to differ depending upon the specific site but applicants will be required to demonstrate that all of the housing to be produced within the project will be affordable to the rockledge workforce area 2 higher densities and a variety of housing types are encouraged to assure that the housing products will be priced at levels that are within the means of the very low low moderate and workforce household income levels smalllot singlefamily homes cottages townhomes or housing over retail for homeownership where commercial zoning is in place andor rental are all housing types that may be appropriate within overlay areas 3 a conceptual plan approved by the planning commission and city council will require no additional meetings before the planning commission or city council as long as the plan is not significantly altered e project suitability criteria the determination of whether parcels within the overlay area are suitable for an affordable incentive bonus will require satisfaction of all the following criteria 1 the site is located within a designated affordable housing overlay area  2 the housing types proposed result in sales prices that are affordable to the local areas workforce based on the distribution of moderate low and verylow income levels  3 neighborhood

objective a general objective the objective of this section is to establish requirements for the placement installation and maintenance of signs or street graphics in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens as the regulation of the placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the police power so too is the regulation of the placement installation and maintenance of street graphics since such graphics in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings b controlling interference with motorists the regulation of the placement installation and maintenance of street graphics is further justified by their innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to them potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to which a majority of signs is oriented therefore it is the intent of this section to regulate the size and location of street graphics so that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions c aesthetic finally it is the objective of this section to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the placement installation and maintenance of street graphics the fact that such graphics are intended to command visual contact grants to graphics a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community the aesthetic impact of street graphics is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property  therefore the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality it is contended that it is not irrational for a communitys citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness if minimized with this purpose in mind it is the intention of this section to authorize the use of street graphics which are 1 compatible with their surroundings 2 appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain  3 expressive of the identity of the individual proprietors or of the community as a whole  4 large enough to sufficiently convey a message about the owner or occupants of a particular property or the business activities conducted on such property yet small enough to preserve and protect the natural beauty of the city and limit distractions to motorists 8602  definitions the following words and terms when used in this section shall have the following meanings
