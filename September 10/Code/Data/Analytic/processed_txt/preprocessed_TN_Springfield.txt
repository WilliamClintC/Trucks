only when the noncomplying feature has been taken down will the guidelines take effect roofs 1 make the shape and pitch of roofs on new construction imitate the shape and pitch of roofs on neighboring existing houses or other houses of the same architectural tyle replacement roofs must copy the shape and pitch or original roofs and the soffit fasc ia and trim detail between roof and wall should be compatible with the original 2 the eaves on additions or new buildings should have an overhang that is compatible with the original eaves a minimum overhang of at least twelve inches should be used on

appropriate as are slate standing seam metal or metal or wood shingle roof coverings 4 do not use satellite dishes solar collectors modern skylights on roof planes that are visible from the street or install them where they interfere with decorative roof elements windows 1 reuse original windows if possible it will be much less expensive and much better historically to retain the original windows 2 storm windows are often considered when a homeowner wants to increase the heating and cooling efficiency of a building interior storm windows that cannot be seen from the street might be a better alternative to exterior storm windows if exterior storm windows are used they can be wood or color clad metal to match the buildings trim exterior storm windows shall only be used if they do not damage or obscure the original windows and frames 3 if replacement windows are necessary they must be the same overall size as the originals with the same pane division 4 windows may not be replaced with fixed thermal glazing or be made inoperable 5 tinted or reflective glass shall not be used on primary or other important elevations loe glass which selectively blocks ultraviolet light is allowed

full height of the original window openings do not cut across an existing window with a new floor or ceiling so that the outside appearance of the window is changed 8 reuse existing serviceable window hardware porches 1 porches on historic houses shall be repaired or replicated using wood materials for ceilings balustrades posts and colunms that duphcate the original size and design reconstruction of the d cumented original porch is appropriate 2 as a general rule porches particularly porches visible from a street should not be enclosed if ljorches are enclosed the enclosure should be compatible with the original size and design of the porch and maintain the existing architectural clements and installed in a way that it may be removed at a later date 3 new buildings constrnct d in

coverings wood 1 do not use destructive paint removal methods such as propane or butane torches sand blasting or water blasting these methods can damage historic wood and create the need for expensive

parts mu t be based on historical pictorial and physical docwnentation if documentation does not exist a new sympathetically designed feature would be better than a hypothetical old one 8 remove damaged or deteriorated paint only to the next sound layer using the gentlest method possible eg band sanding or hand scraping 9 when paint must be removed electric hotair guns and beat plates hould be used only with extreme caution since the high temperatures they cause can ignite material in the wall cavities and cause fi re damage when using electric heating devices be sure to keep a fire
