the purpose of this section is to provide recreational areas and amenities in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision development in the city this section is derived from the ordinance enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city granted under the texas constitution and statutes of the state of texas including without limitation vtca local government et seq and  et seq 2 it is hereby declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks and related amenities and improvements are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for the same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property of a residential subdivision in the city whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas 3 neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby the standards for which are set forth in the latest comprehensive plan as amended the neighborhood parks shown within the zones on the map of the city which is on file with the city based upon the official latest comprehensive plan as amended shall be prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby within such zone the cost of the neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks within such zones shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities therefore the requirements listed in d park land requirements of this section are adopted to attain such purposes 4 the dedications of land and fees collected from within the various park service zones shall be utilized to create neighborhood parks within such park service zone b process overview before a plat application may be submitted for review the developer shall gain the city councils approval of the dedication required by this section the prerequisite of the city councils approval of the dedication before the submittal of a plat application is required because the city council is not a part of the general platting approval process therefore the only opportunity for the city council to approve a park land dedication that best meets the communitys vision is before a plat application is submitted c park

interest of the city 4 once the city council has approved a dedication a developer may submit a plat application all subsequently related plat application shall conform to the city councils approval d park land requirements 1 general requirements  dedication of land and payment of park development fee a dedication of land or payment in lieu required i prior to a plat being filed with the county for

submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section the required land dedication of this section may be met by a payment in lieu of land where permitted by the city or required by other provisions in this section iii the city council declares that development of an area of less than five 5 acres for neighborhood park purposes is impractical therefore if fewer than 665 dwelling units are proposed by a plat filed for approval the city council may require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount as provided in d2 cash in lieu of land of this section b park development fee required i in addition to the required dedication of land as set forth in subsections 615d1ai and 615d1aii of this section there shall also be a park development fee paid to the city as a condition to subdivision plat approval such park development fee shall be set from time to time by ordinance of the city council sufficient to provide for the development of amenities and improvements on undeveloped park land within the relevant zone at the then current costs as determined by the city council to meet the standards for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which the subdivision is located the fee may vary from park service zone to park service zone and may be set below actual development costs unless and until changed by an ordinance amendment of the city council the park development fee shall be calculated on the basis of $30000 per dwelling unit ii in lieu of payment of the required park development fee a developer shall have the option to construct the neighborhood park amenities and improvements all plans and specifications for the construction of such amenities and improvements must be reviewed and approved by the city the developer shall financially guarantee the construction of the amenities and improvements and the city must approve the same prior to the filing of a plat in the case of platted subdivisions once

considerations i in instances where land is required to be dedicated the city shall have the right to accept or reject the dedication and to require a cash payment in lieu of land in the amount provided under subsection 615d2 cash in lieu of land of this section if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development or if the recreation potential for that area would be better served by expanding or improving existing neighborhood parks ii when two or more developments will be necessary to create a neighborhood park of sufficient size in the same area the planning and zoning commission with final approval by the city council at the time of preliminary plat approval will work with the developers to define the optimum location of the required dedication within the respective plats once a park site has been determined adjacent property owners who develop around the park site shall dedicate land and cash to the existing site unless otherwise determined by the city council and shall take the existence of such park into consideration in the design of its site with respect to access to the park sidewalks and the like this provision is applicable even if the adjacent property is not in the park service zone for that park iii in the event the city determines that the area of proposed development or construction contains a location that is desirable for a neighborhood park but the required land dedication for such proposed development or construction is not sufficient to provide the land necessary the following provisions will apply a the developer shall negotiate in good faith with the city to sell the additional land to the city approval of the subdivision plat or building permit as the case may be may be delayed by the city for up to 275 calendar days past the time for approval set forth in the citys zoning accommodate such negotiation b as part of such negotiated price for the land the city will be permitted to offer any or all of the following to the developer i double credit for both land dedication and park development fees  ii consideration of developerowners desires with respect to the type of park development or amenities planned for the park  iii alteration of open space requirements for the subdivision or development  iv offset against any other capital improvements required by city ordinance for the development  v commitment on the part of the city to develop the park within a specified period of time  or vi any other reasonable concession by the city with respect to its development ordinances iv in the event condemnation is necessary such incentives above shall not apply 2 cash in lieu of land a a developer responsible for land dedication under this section may be required at the city councils option to meet the dedication requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land in the amount set forth in d2b such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to filing the final plat for record or prior to the issuance of a building permit where a plat is not required b the cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the payment of a fee set from time to time by ordinance of the city council sufficient to acquire neighborhood parkland or to expand or improve existing neighborhood parks within the relevant zone unless and until changed by the city council such fee shall be computed on the basis of $20000 per dwelling unit the city council may review the fee from time to time and the new fee established shall be based upon its determination of land costs in the respective park service zones for fees pertaining to each zone or in the city generally and its extraterritorial jurisdiction if the fee is uniform throughout the city the fee may vary from zone to zone and may be set below the actual costs determined c a cash payment in lieu of land dedication as set forth in d2b does not relieve the developer of its obligation to pay the park development fee set forth in d1bi the cash payment in lieu of land dedication is in addition to the required park development fee d the city may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development if the city does purchase park land in a park service area subsequent park land dedications for that zone may be in cash only the calculation of which is set forth in d2b such cash payment is in addition to the payment of the required park development fee 3 special fund  right to refund a all funds collected by this dedication process will be deposited in the citys park development fund the funds for each park service zone are used solely for the purchase or leasing of parkland and the development of the same within the relevant zones such funds may be commingled for administrative purposes all expenditures from the fund will be reviewed and approved by the city council b the city shall account for all sums paid into the park development fund with reference to the individual plats involved any monies paid into the fund must be expended by the city within ten years from the date received by the city such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in first out basis in a particular park service zone if not so expended within the tenyear period the then owners of the property within such zone or the then owners of property contributing to such fund will on the last day of such period be entitled to a refund of the remaining fees the current owners of the property within the subdivision must request such a refund within one year of entitlement in writing or such right is waived 4 additional requirements a any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses the following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable i any area primarily located in the 100year floodplain ii any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders the same unusable for organized recreational activities the above characteristics of a park land dedication area may be grounds for refusal of any plat b drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the channel is to remain more or less in its natural state or constructed in accordance with city engineering standards if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel and if not less than five acres of the site is above the 100year floodplain or if the dedication is in excess of ten acres not more than 50 percent of the site is to be included in the 100year floodplain c each park must have ready access to a public street d unless provided otherwise in this section an action by the city shall be by the city council e

structures on the property for which the sign is proposed that would impede the replacement of a sign were constructed prior to  that it is impractical to abide by existing placement height or area regulations due to the placement size of construction of existing structures in relationship to the physical characteristics of the site for purposes of illustration physical characteristics may include topography of the site or surrounding sites structures on surrounding sites traffic conditions street layouts and existing natural vegetation that the other types of signs which are permitted
