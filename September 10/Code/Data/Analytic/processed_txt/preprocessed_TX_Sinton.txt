with the same degree of safety as existed in the original well a supplemental permit may be issued without additional filing fee to the permit fee authorizing the deepening and operation of the well to such specified depth as applied for not exceeding in any event a total depth from a surface in excess of 10000 feet in any deeper drilling or any deeper completion or any deeper production operations the permittee shall comply with all other provisions contained in this chapter and applicable to the drilling completion and operation of a well or wells b once any well which has theretofore been a producer of oil or gas or both of them has ceased to produce to the extent that the owner thereof has abandoned same and his leases in the drilling block in which the well is located have expired or been released and someone other than such operator has acquired new leases from the owners of 51 percent or more of the area embraced in the drilling block including the lot tract or parcel upon which the well is located and has in addition thereto acquired the casing tubing and all equipment in connection with such abandoned well and desires to attempt to put such well

tested at a pressure in pounds per square inch calculated by multiplying the length of the producing string by twotenths with the maximum test pressure required unless otherwise ordered by the commission not to exceed 1500 pounds per square inch if at the end of 30 minutes pressure shows a drop of ten percent or more of the above required test pressure the casing shall be condemned after corrective operation the casing shall again be tested in the same manner a swab test may be used by reducing the fluid level in the hold to a point at least midway between the calculated top and bottom of the cement columns on the outside of the string being tested after such swabbing test the casing shall set 12 hours before the cement plug is drilled if fluid level shows a rise equivalent to two percent of the swabbed distance the casing shall be retested if a second similar test shows leaky condition the casing shall be condemned until condition is corrected these tests shall be witnessed by a city representative 3 the proposed method of getting the well back on production 4 evidence that he is the owner of the casing and other equipment in and on the well 5 and a statement of the cost to him of the casing and other equipment in and on the well with proof thereof and an estimate of the cost of the other equipment and the services and labor required in getting the well back on production c if the city council is satisfied that all of the things set out in the application are true and correct and that the operation outlined in the application will not create a dangerous or hazardous condition they may in their discretion issue a supplemental permit to such applicant for such operation and for the production of the well same to remain in force and effect as long as such operations are carried on and if they result in production as long as such production continues conditioned that the permittee shall comply with all of the provisions of this chapter except as specifically set out herein d notice of the hearing for such application shall not be required and if the well which the applicant desires to attempt to get back on production has been completed for more than one year prior to the date of such supplemental permit the amount of bond may be set at whatever amount is deemed suitable by the city council not less than an amount as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time there shall be no filing fee for such application and no fee for the supplemental permit the provisions of sections 11628 and 11629 providing for payments to nonleasing owners in the drilling block and for the right to acquire an interest in the well shall apply in the same manner as if such supplemental permit was for the purpose of and provided for the drilling of a well e in the event the well was outside the corporate limits of the city when the well was originally drilled the city council shall have the authority to waive drilling block requirements   25         number per drilling block there shall not be more than one well drilled within any drilling block for each producing

responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows ia 8162016 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage ib 8162016 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area ic 8162016 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands id 8162016 article ii  definitions definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
