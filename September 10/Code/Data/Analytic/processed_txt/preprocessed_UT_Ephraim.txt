section to regulate personal wireless services antennas and related electronic equipment and structures and to provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the city as well as to minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth facilities by encouraging the colocation of multiple antennas on a single structure by encouraging the location of antennas on preexisting support structures and by encouraging the use of cityowned property for antenna support structure as well as to establish siteing appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities to comply with the telecommunications act of 1996 by establishing regulations that 1 do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services 2 do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally

manner that mitigates potential negative impacts on surrounding properties whether the facility is located on a parcel of sufficient size to adequately support the facility location on parcel whether the structure is situated on the parcel in a manner that can best protect the interests of surrounding property owners but still accommodate other appropriate uses of the parcel location in general whether location or colocation of the facility on other structures in the same vicinity is practicable without significantly affecting the antenna transmission or reception capabilities the willingness of the applicant to allow colocation on its facility by other personal wireless services providers on such terms as are common in the industry not permitted uses the following antenna

commission as part of the conditional use permit approval process in making the decision the commission shall consider the definition of stealth facilities set forth in this shall consider whether the facility is disguised blended or screened in a manner that eliminates any negative impact to surrounding properties each stealth facility certification applies to one location only because of differing circumstances specific to each site an antenna that qualifies as a stealth facility in one location may not qualify as a stealth facility in a different location towers if the applicant

of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance paragraph a3 variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
