any obligations of the applicant for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for 5 refund if any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the applicant or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements in the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority the difference between the applicants actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds including accrued interest if any shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements 6 interest limitation if money is refunded within six 6 months of deposit only the principal will be refunded monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued calculated at one percent 1% less than the rate of actual earnings e traffic impact analysis any proposed development

building permits at level of service c or above 5 effect of adequacy determination if the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required herein the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions a the deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed  b a reduction in the density or intensity of development  c the dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein  or d any combination of techniques
