sediment control a findings the village hereby finds that 1 the soil types found in the village are susceptible to erosion and if left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property  2 the topography of the village contains areas with steep slopes upon which if clearing of trees andor inappropriate construction takes place could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in damage to property  3 excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to  the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainage ways and the creation of recreational facilities  4 the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  5 soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washed out fills and embankments  6 sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes sinkholes wetlands and reservoirs  7 sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and 8 sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased

subgrade strength condition subgrade strengths at the time of construction should be at least six percent cbr   six percent in the top 12 inches of the subgrade for pavement designs that do not require a design cbr value such as in the idot bde pavement design sections a soil support rating of poor should be used where appropriate an illinois bearing ratio ibr of two percent shall be used for design the dcp dynamic cone penetrometer is used to estimate the in situ cbr of granular materials and finegrained soils the dcp can be used to determine that the recommended subgrade cbr of six
