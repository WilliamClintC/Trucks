safety and welfare and to the protection of our natural resources 2 water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of the limits of the city of east lansing are at times subjected to flooding flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city of east lansing and the region 3 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion increased sediment transport and deposition and increased nonpoint source pollutant loading to the receiving water bodies and the great lakes 4 stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants 5 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and have impacted the water resources of the red cedar river and the looking glass river watersheds 6 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city of east lansing will absent proper regulation and control adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources and those of downstream communities 7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development 8 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow 9 adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained in this article and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff 10 substantial economic losses can result from adverse impacts on the waters of the city of east lansing and the watershed 11 improper design and construction of stormwater best management practices bmps can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 12 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities is necessary in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff 13 the regulation of land development activities by means of stormwater management policies and procedures and site design will help produce developments that are compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby help mitigate the adverse effects of stormwater runoff from the developments

industrial users treatment facility severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c notice 1 if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the city if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass 2 an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass

superintendent shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm daily production such as the average daily production during a representative year for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production 2 when calculating equivalent concentration limitations under subsection 3 of this section the superintendent shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived under subsection 3 of this section by the average daily flow rate of the industrial users regulated process wastewater this average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year 3 equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of section 307d of the act and this division industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 4 if categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where applied the same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating both types of equivalent limitations 5 any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the superintendent within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate ch 24a  27 dilution of discharge prohibited except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement the superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate ch 24a  29 accidental discharges a protection from accidental discharges all categorical and noncategorical industrialcommercial users with the potential to

classification which permits a variety of housing at different densities and limited office use it establishes a base level of development at a relatively low density and other requirements which at a minimum will preserve the attractiveness desirability and privacy of residential neighborhoods it encourages the planning and development of larger parcels by permitting different types of housing at different densities within the site and limited amounts of office use to buffer residential uses from major streets it also provides density bonuses reductions in lot sizes and setbacks and other flexibility in the base standards when the objectives below and certain other specified standards are met to encourage innovative design the ultimate goal of the district is to increase the amount and variety of housing opportunities in the city while protecting the interests of residents and the overall attractiveness of the city b it is also the purpose of the district to achieve the following objectives 1 to have land developed in a planned and orderly manner by requiring a minimum site size and by providing density bonuses as an incentive to accumulate larger parcels at one time or in
