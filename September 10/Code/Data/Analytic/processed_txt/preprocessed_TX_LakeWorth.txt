within the city adopted  article  flood damage prevention authorization the legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses this article is adopted pursuant to that authority of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage    97562 of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5

charge against subsequent developers for a period of twelve 12 years following completion and acceptance of the utilities at the expiration of the seventh year the developer will no longer be entitled to receive any reimbursement 1987 ordinances  of reimbursement funds a the city shall establish an escrow fund for the deposit of all pro rata payments made by subsequent developers a separate escrow fund shall be established for each public utility system constructed by an initial developer all monies received from subsequent developments or subdivisions in that drainage basin or service area shall be deposited in that specific escrow fund b twice each year on january 30 and on july 31 the city manager or hisher designee shall inventory each escrow account to determine what percentage of those monies is allocable to reimbursable oversizing costs owed by the city as determined under this allocation shall be determined in the same proportion that the cost of the oversized line bears to the cost of an eight 8 inch line upon completion of such inventory the city manager or hisher designee shall transmit all escrow funds due and owing to the initial    417562 developer upon payment of these funds the city will receive a credit for the amount of money allocable toward its reimbursable oversizing requirements as set forth in c the developer shall be responsible for providing to the city and maintaining with the city an accurate current address when escrowed funds are available for disbursement the city shall notify the developer at the address on file with the city if the developer fails to withdraw the funds within six 6 months the funds shall be forfeited to the citys water and sewer fund d at no time shall the developer be entitled to receive reimbursement for a sum greater than the initial cost of the public utilities less the pro rata share of capacity of that utility system that would have been attributable to the initial developer for his proportionate share of capacity in the system 1987 ordinances   adopted  in order to provide appropriate capacity for reasonably anticipated development in a drainage basin or service area the city manager or hisher designee may require a developer to install a utility line or system improvement larger than necessary to support the developers specific development in the event that the city manager or hisher designee requires the installation of a utility line larger than required to serve the development the developer installing the line will be reimbursed by the city for the difference in cost between the size of the line required by the city manager or hisher designee and an eight 8 inch line or the size of the line required to serve the development whichever is greater the city will have five 5 years to pay the developer for the difference in cost for the oversizing requirement the city may compensate the developer for the difference in cost mandated by oversizing process of allowing the developer credits of up to fifty 50 percent of all development fees charged against any portion or phase of the development requiring construction of the utility lines upon written request of the developer credit for development fees may be transferred from the current development project to subsequent development projects subdivisions or phases undertaken by the developer any balance

the term positive drainage facility design recurrence interval closed storm sewer systems 10year with 100year positive overflow for inlets on grade in streets such that the depth of flow in the street does not exceed the top of curb for inlets at low points or in a roadway sag the 100year flow must be captured within the curb culverts and bridges 100year concretelined chan 100year earthen channels 100year detention facilities 100year page b56 appendix b dccs overflow means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded the excess flow can be conveyed overland along a grassed or paved course normally this would mean along a street or alley if not the excess flow path shall require the dedications of drainage easements on private property the following guidelines shall be followed to determine the storm frequency to be used to design a storm drainage system c runoff calculations 1 methodology a the selection of method to be used to calculate runoff depends upon the size of the contributing drainage area at the most downstream point of the project b the rational method is acceptable for designing projects with drainage areas of less than 100 acres c a unit hydrograph method is required for projects with larger drainage areas d regardless of the method used runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed conditions in accordance with the ultimate land use assumption in the current comprehensive land use plan for the city of lake worth the design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream properties and calculating runoff as if the offsite property was developed without any detention if an approved regional detentionretention facility is in operation the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility 2 procedure for drainage areas less than 100 acres a methodology the rational method is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge therefore the duration of the storm used is equivalent to the time of concentration of the basin the formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is q   cia where q   the maximum rate of discharge cfs c   coefficient of runoff based on topography soil land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the rainfall producing runoff occurs i   intensity of rainfall for the time period it takes for flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to reach the point of design inhr a   drainage area contributing to the runoff at the specified concentration pointoutfall acres page b57 appendix b dccs b runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient c in the rational method equation is dependent on the character of the soil and the degree and type of development in the drainage area normally as a drainage area develops the amount of runoff increases in proportion to the amount of impervious area the runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate land use as recommended in the current city of lake worth comprehensive plan c time of concentration the time of concentration is the longest time without interruption of flow by detention devices for a drop of water to flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to the point of concentration point of design of the basin note that this is not necessarily the point at the longest physical distance from the point of concentration but the point from which it will take runoff the longest time to reach the concentration point scs methodology is recommended to determine the time of concentration tc this method separates the flow watershed into three regimes sheet flow shallow concentrated flow and open channel flow i sheet flow sheet flow is flow over plane surfaces it occurs in the uppermost area of the defined basin the time of concentration in minutes for sheet flow is determined using the following equation where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second tc   time of concentration minutes the longest flowpath for the water is determined for each basin begins at the most hydraulically distant point in the basin and ends at the concentration point for the basin the sheet flow length is then measured along this flowpath from the uppermost part of the basin for a length no more than three hundred 300 feet at a maximum distance of three hundred 300 feet sheet flow typically changes to shallow concentrated flow a slope should be estimated along this length of flow a velocity corresponding to this slope was determined using the upland method graph found in appendix b1 v d t csheetflow   60 page b58 appendix b dccs iii shallow concentrated flow shallow concentrated flow typically begins where sheet flow ends a projected slope should be established along the flowline for the shallow concentrated flow length a velocity corresponding to this slope is determined from the shallow concentrated flow graph in appendix b1 the time of concentration in minutes for shallow concentrated flow is determined by the following equation where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second tc   time of concentration minutes iii open channel flow open channel flow is applicable for large channel sections and closed storm sewers in some cases in most cases it is not applicable for the rational method since large channels indicate large watersheds where a unit hydrograph method is applied in the city of lake worth the time of concentration for open channel flow is determined using the following equations where d   distance along the flow path feet v   velocity feet per second tc   time of concentration minutes where v is estimated using a combination of the continuity equation and mannings equation where n   mannings n r   ap   hydraulic radius feet a   area square feet p   wetted perimeter feet s   slope feet feet  v d t cshallowconcentratedflow   60 v d t cchannelflow

time of concentration of inlets when designing inlets and laterals the time of concentration is equal to the inlet time the design engineer shall compare the specified inlet times in the table below to the actual calculated inlet time by computing the flow time overland and along the gutter to the first inlet in no case shall a shorter inlet time or time of concentration be used than the times specified in the table below the following table includes the values for coefficient of runoff and minimum inlet time for different land uses in the city vi travel time the travel time in a conduit or channel from the inlet to the point of design shall be determined use of mannings equation when attempting to determine offsite fully developed flow for a currently undeveloped area or singlefamily
