provisions  lawn maintenance subd 1 preamble the council finds that there are a variety of landscapes in the city that add diversity and a richness to the quality of life certain areas in the city have been left or allowed to go unmaintained these have been accepted by the vast majority of the city residents as appropriate and as part of the unique quality of life in this community there are community expectations however that once an area has been disturbed landscaped or otherwise maintained that area will continue to be maintained in a consistent manner when vegetation in that area is not continually maintained it becomes aesthetically unpleasing and violates community standards property that appears neglected may decrease the value of adjacent properties in addition if vegetation is not properly maintained there may be the following adverse impacts on public health safety and welfare a undesirable vegetation such as common buckthorn quackgrass and other weeds may invade and threaten to supplant other more desirable vegetation  b vegetation that causes allergic reactions such as ragweed may develop  and c tall vegetation along driveways and public roads may impair visibility when entering or exiting public roads the council also finds that it is in the public interest to allow citizens to choose the type of landscaping on their properties and to make changes in that vegetation as a protection for the larger community however this change in vegetation must be properly managed and maintained and the length of the transition period must be minimized the council finds that the establishment of prairie and meadow plant communities is an acceptable landscape treatment in the city this requires special consideration however because weeds will grow during the first few years of transition before the new vegetation predominates and will appear like neglect therefore the council finds that this type of vegetation is acceptable if it is properly maintained to shorten the transition period and if notice is given of the intended result in contrast the transition to trees and other woody species does not require special consideration because untended grass or weeds are not a necessary part of that transition period rather the transition period is shortened by eliminating competition around the seedlings techniques as organic mulch 818 the council enacts this ordinance to balance the public interest in a variety of vegetation with the public need to ensure proper maintenance of that vegetation the council finds that establishing a height limitation for certain vegetation is in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare as outlined above and is a reasonable maintenance standard subd 2 definitions for purposes of this following words have the meanings specified below a meadow vegetation is grasses and flowering broadleaf plants that are native to or adapted to the state of minnesota and that are commonly found in meadow and prairie plant communities except weeds b noxious weeds are those plants so designated by the state of minnesota pursuant to minnesota statute 1877 subd 8 and those listed under minnesota rule parts

property owner may establish that a plant or plants are not horticulturally out of place by providing a written landscape plan for the area in question complete with a listing and locations of plant species the plants specifically listed above may not be included within the landscape plan vegetation that does not comply with this plan are weeds subd 3 maintenance standard the maintenance standard in this to property that has been developed with a building as defined in the citys building including vacant property combined with developed property for tax purposes and a parcel of property that

the wca and any future amendments adopted by the legislature the city has determined that some activities are exempted from the provisions of the wca any activities exempted from the provisions of the wca are also exempted from the requirements of this insofar as they relate to the wca the provisions of this all wetlands including those governed by the department of natural resources 3 in addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the minnesota pollution control agency has required the city to address potential nonpoint source impacts from future development with the establishment of buffer strip standards to complement the existing stormwater standards a buffer strip is an upland area left in its or restored to its natural nonturf grass state that surrounds a wetland and reduces negative impacts to wetlands from adjacent development catch basins and storm sewers typically collect street and front yard drainage and direct the drainage to an appropriately sized pond for pretreatment prior to discharge to a wetland or waterbody back yard drainage typically reaches wetlands or waterbodies without any pretreatment thereby allowing lawn and garden chemicals sediments pet wastes fertilizer and other types of contaminants to directly impact the receiving waterbody 4 the city has found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered wetlands exhibit great variations in their overall quality therefore the city has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to protect wetlands delano subdivision protection 102 based on their needs for their existing quality b purpose 1 through the adoption and enforcement of this the city shall promote the general health safety and wetland of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this the city seeks to accomplish the following a to satisfy the requirements of the wca as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city b to satisfy the requirements of the minnesota pollution control agency by treating nonpoint source pollution that currently is not treated by ponds primarily back yard drainage and to limit disturbance from adjacent development by utilizing the appropriately sized buffer strip c to balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city d to promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge groundwater and receive the discharge of groundwater to retain sediment and toxins and to filter nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into the crow river thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features e to provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city f to prevent property damage and the losses associated with flood conditions and reduce erosion problems g to preserve the natural character of the landscape restoration of wetland ecosystems 102 scope of application a applicants that have preliminary plat approvals previously obtained or have subdivision

into consideration the recommendation of the wca tep and information provided by the applicant the decisions regarding wetland classifications cannot be appealed to the board of water and soil resources this section is applicable to wetlands that are delineated to be jurisdictional wetlands based on delineation procedures of the wetland conservation act e this section establishes three wetland classifications as defined in of this manage 1 manage 2 manage 3 delano subdivision protection 104 103 wetland management classification determination in the provisions that follow the methodology and criteria required for evaluation of floral diversityintegrity are based on those detailed in the minnesota routine assessment method for evaluating wetland functions version 20 minnesota board of water and soil resources september 1998 the functional value for floral diversityintegrity will be determined from mnram which divides wetlands into wetland communities ie wet meadow shallow marsh floodplain forest etc and provides a ranking of exceptional high moderate and low to all major wetland communities within a wetland an applicant that is proposing any new development will be required to submit a mnram form filled out for each wetland if located on the subject property this mnram form will need to be filled out by a consultant trained in wetland science this ordinance provides the criteria to place wetlands into appropriate classifications a functional value index which is based on a scale of 01 to 10 with 01 being the lowest ranking and 10 being the highest ranking will be utilized to determine an overall functional value index for the wetland floral diversityintegrity functional value index exceptional quality 10 high quality 075 moderate quality 05 low quality 01 each wetland will be given a ranking based on the functional value for each of the major wetland communities or community within the wetlands the overall ranking for the wetland will be based on a weighted average that incorporates the area of the wetland community percent and the functional value index 00 to 10 for the wetland community within the wetland the overall wetland functional index range for floral diversityintegrity and the associated wetland management classifications are shown in table 1 table 2 shows how management classifications are determined for
