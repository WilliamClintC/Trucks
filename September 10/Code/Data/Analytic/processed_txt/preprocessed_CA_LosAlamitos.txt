business licenses  purpose and intent it is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adultoriented businesses to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials it is recognized that adultoriented businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas as well as the areas in which they are located it is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish standards for the conduct of adultoriented businesses which will protect the public health safety and welfare preserve locally recognized values of community appearance minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adultoriented businesses and maintain local property values in approving the regulations contained in this chapter the city council has reviewed detailed studies reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses these studies included

general report 1989  newport news virginia 1996  st paul minnesota 1987  corpus christi texas 1995  national law center 1995  and los alamitos 2003 collectively studies the studies a summary of which is found in exhibit a and is available at the city clerks office substantiate the adverse secondary effects of adultoriented businesses a based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the city council finds that 1 adultoriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them 2 both the proximity of adultoriented businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adultoriented businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located 3 unregulated adultoriented businesses create serious public health concerns and hazards since the studies and cases demonstrate that such businesses have been linked to the spread of communicable and sexuallytransmitted diseases 4 special regulation of adultoriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for special regulation is based on the recognition that adultoriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses parks schools churches or day care centers 5 it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the establishment and operation of adultoriented businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects thus in order to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry especially minors special regulations are necessary 6 the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare require that certain operational requirements for adultoriented businesses also be imposed b in adopting these regulations the city council is mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendments of the united states and california constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses the city council has

elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in a  2009  floodways since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within orange county b within an adopted regulatory floodway orange county shall prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge c if a and b are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   2009  nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of los alamitos to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2009  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of los alamitos need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of los alamitos believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the orange county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  2009  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city of los alamitos shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city of los alamitos may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of

a purpose and findings 1 it is the purpose and intent of this section to provide for the reasonable and uniform regulation of adultoriented businesses in the city it is recognized that adultoriented businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas as well as the areas in which they are located it is the purpose of this section to establish criteria and standards for the establishment and conduct of adultoriented businesses that will protect the public health safety and welfare  preserve locally recognized values of community appearance  minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adultoriented businesses  and maintain local property values 2 it is the purpose and intent of this section to establish proper regulations and to provide for a reasonable number of approximately located sites for adultoriented businesses within the city based upon the following findings a the following studies that substantiate the adverse secondary effects of adultoriented businesses were reviewed by the city  austin texas 1986   indianapolis indiana 1984   los angeles california 1977   phoenix arizona 1979   st paul minnesota 1989   garden grove california 1991  and  upland california 1992 b based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the council finds that i adultoriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them ii both the proximity of adultoriented businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adultoriented businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located 3 the studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that the proximity and concentration of adultoriented businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational or other adultoriented businesses can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere 4 the studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that adultoriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates and blighting of those areas in which they are located and that surround them 5 the special regulation of adultoriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for the special regulation is based on the recognition that adultoriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity with sensitive uses eg residential zones and uses parks schools religious institutions or day care centers having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas 6 it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration or location of adultoriented businesses in a manner that would create adverse secondary effects thus in order to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry especially including minors the special regulation of the time place and manner of the location and operation of adultoriented businesses is necessary 7 the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare require that certain distances be maintained between adultoriented businesses and residential uses and zones religious institutions schools day care centers parks and other adultoriented businesses 8 the need to regulate the proximity of adultoriented businesses to sensitive land uses eg residential religious educational recreational and other adultoriented businesses is documented in studies conducted by other jurisdictions as listed elsewhere in this section 9 the report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  indicates that a community impacts of sexually oriented businesses are primarily a function of two variables proximity to residential areas and concentration property values are directly affected within a small radius typically one block of the location of a sexually oriented business concentration may compound depression of property values and may lead to an increase of crime sufficient to change the quality of life and perceived desirability of property in a neighborhood b the impacts of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated when they are located near each other when sexually oriented businesses have multiple uses ie theater bookstore nude dancing peep booths one structure can have the impact of several separate businesses 10 in consideration of the findings of the report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  it is appropriate to prohibit the concentration of multiple adultoriented businesses within one structure in order to mitigate the compounded adverse secondary effects associated with the concentrations as described above 11 the provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials that are protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution and the relevant provisions of the california state constitution 12 the proposed parking standards are necessary in the interests of
