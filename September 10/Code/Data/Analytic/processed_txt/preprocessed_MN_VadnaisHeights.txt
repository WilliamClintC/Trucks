approaches and processes the planned unit development zoning district pud procedures are here set forth in order that the public health safety morals and general welfare be furthered in an era of increasing urbanization  to encourage innovations in residential commercial and industrial development and renewal  so that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation shops and industrial plants conveniently located to each other may extend to all citizens and residents of the city  to reflect changes in the technology of land development  to encourage a more creative approach in the utilization of land in order to accomplish a more efficient aesthetic and desirable development which may be characterized by special features of the geography topography size or shape of a particular

principal uses or structures on a single parcel of ground or contiguous parcels provided that the total area is five acres or larger the pud shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses and grouping of buildings parking areas circulation and open spaces and shall be designed as an integrated unit in such manner as to constitute a safe efficient and convenient urban area under the

terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community d puds involving multiple housing types a residential pud may provide for a variety of housing types in any one of the basic residential zoning districts the total number of dwelling units allowed in a development shall be determined by either the area standards of the zoning district in which the proposed development is to be located or the density specified by the planning commission and approved by the council consistent with the intent of the citys land use plan a plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations applicable to the site but if the density or intensity of land use exceeds by more than ten percent that permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to the site the applicant has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring

proposed use of common open space the location design and type of dwelling units and the physical characteristics of the site e front rear and side yard building setback regulations building setbacks

necessary and requested by the city secs 3862538653  reserved article v  adult uses adult uses  background intent and purpose a the state attorney general prepared a report entitled report of the attorney generals working group on regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  the report considered evidence from studies conducted in minneapolis and st paul and in other cities throughout the country relating to sexuallyoriented businesses also called adult establishments b the attorney generals report based upon the above referenced studies and testimony presented to it concluded that sexuallyoriented businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values in addition the attorney generals working group   heard testimony that the character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses adjacent to residential property the report concluded that 1 adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses  2 residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters bookstores and other adult uses experience increased crime rates sexrelated crimes in particular lowered property values increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  3 the adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult use increases  4 studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes prostitution child molestation indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  5 the city of phoenix arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexuallyoriented businesses  6 many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are located as less safe than other areas which do not have such uses  7 studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity to adult uses  8 the indianapolis indiana study established that professional real estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a one to three block area of the store  9 the adverse impacts of adult uses are exacerbated when the uses are located near each other  and 10 the presence of liquor establishments in the immediate vicinity of adult uses also compounds the adverse impacts on the neighborhood c the city council finds that the characteristics of the city are similar to those of the cities cited by the report when considering the effects of adult uses d the city council finds based upon the report and the studies cited therein that adult uses would have secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city e the city council directed that a study be undertaken of the existing zoning ordinance and other city regulations to address adult uses the intent of the study was to determine how the city might reasonably amend the zoning ordinance to address the concerns raised by the studies cited and to offer reasonable alternative avenues of expression for the free speech activities guaranteed by recent supreme court rulings for adult uses f the city council finds based on the abovecited zoning study that adult uses could reasonably be allowed in the industrial district if separated from certain sensitive land uses if those same sensitive land uses are not allowed in the industrial district and if potential adult uses are separated from one another the city council also finds that there are a reasonable number of distinct locations within the citys industrial districts where adult uses might locate and meet reasonable spacing standards from sensitive land uses and from one another  definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except
