of sidewalk vendors  purpose a the purpose of this chapter is to establish a permitting and regulatory program for sidewalk vendors that complies with senate bill 946 statutes 2018 b the city council hereby finds that 1 prohibiting sidewalk vending in streets and medians is necessary to protect the health and safety of vendors because they are at risk of being struck by vehicles andor causing vehicular accidents if they vend in streets or medians 2 limiting sidewalk vendors hours of operation within residential neighborhoods to daylight hours consistent with a residential atmosphere is necessary to protect the safety of sidewalk vendors and residents who would be more vulnerable to criminal activities during evening hours and also to promote the welfare of the residents by prohibiting commercial activities and associated noise and traffic during hours when residents should be able to enjoy peace and quiet further preventing stationary sidewalk vendors in residential neighborhoods and limiting the amount of time a roaming sidewalk vendor may stay in one location within a residential neighbor is necessary for the welfare of the residents of the city because allowing sidewalk vendors to operate at a fixed location in residential neighborhoods may subject residents to increased noise and traffic which may be appropriate for commercial areas but will

council of the city of la habra does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations replacing the existing 2 f 1990   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of la habra are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions

generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas   definitions unless specifically defined below words or

flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge b if a is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   variance procedure a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of la habra to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city of la habra shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the orange county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of the ordinance
