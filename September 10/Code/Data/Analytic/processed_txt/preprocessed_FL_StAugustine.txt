city commission finds 1 sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 198 253448  and currently there are 1400000 people infected with the disease nationally with 40000 people becoming infected annually 8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state of florida with over 100000 aids cases being reported in the state of florida from 1983  2005 and florida ranks third in cumulative aids cases in the united states and has the second highest aids rate in the united states 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 and between 2004 and 200 the national syphilis rate increased 111 per cent 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 and currently 350000 cases of gonorrhea are reported annually with florida reporting over 20000 cases of gonorrhea annually 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films which gives rise to health and aesthetic concerns 16 the findings noted in paragraphs 1 15 above and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexuallyoriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexuallyoriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printed material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments novelties devices or

exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in florida where sexuallyoriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexuallyoriented businesses operating in florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit st augustine who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials and an unhealthy and unsanitary environment possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods discourage wholesome tourism adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are incongruous with other business signage lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31 the activities occurring at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 32 physical contact or touching within sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 33 in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 34 the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexuallyoriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 35 requiring operators of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 36 prohibiting sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses 37 straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 38 workers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of fs ch 796 operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage 39 physical contact or touching between workers of sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmittable diseases 40 the practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 41 sexuallyoriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 42 requiring sexuallyoriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 43 the general welfare health good order morals and safety of the citizens of the

of money despite refusals the use of abusive or profane language unwanted physical contact and the intentional or as incident to the aggressive panhandling and begging blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic additionally the presence of panhandlers and beggars who request money from persons in specific public areas such as outdoor cafes automated teller machines entrances and exits from buildings and while standing in line to enter an event or a building is especially troublesome because persons cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct which often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property as well as incidental to the panhandling and begging activities the imperiling of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of and visitors to st augustine by

areas for the valid exercise of constitutional rights of solicitation which they do as set forth more particularly herein further even if such regulations were to be deemed to trigger strict scrutiny the blockage of ingress and egress into and from commercial businesses and other public areas as well as the impedance of pedestrian walkways and other public rightsofway implicates the compelling
