affects quality of life for its residents workers and visitors is significantly impacted by excess development which causes severe traffic congestion and gridlock as well as air noise and water pollution  b the citys traffic circulation system is already oversaturated and at or near gridlock during rush hours and as such is inadequate to support the citys existing level of development  c these existing traffic and traffic circulation system conditions and their adverse public safety public health and quality of life consequences bear testimony to the fact that the citys existing land use and development review and approval procedures do not carefully or accurately consider nor adequately weigh the adverse impacts to the local environment and quality of life caused by increased density and congestion resulting from major changes in allowable land use  d the standards by which the city evaluates major changes in allowable land use are illdefined and inadequate to avoid or effectively minimize the adverse effects of those changes  and e the people of redondo beach whose quality of life and property rights are at stake should have the power to decide after careful independent evaluation by the city of the adverse environmental effects of major changes in allowable land use based on clear and consistently applied standards whether a proposed major change in allowable land use is worth the added congestion and density it will cause purpose it is the purpose of this article to a give the voters of redondo beach the power to determine whether the city should allow major changes in allowable land use as defined below by requiring voter approval of any such proposed change and thereby ensure maximum public participation in major land use and zoning changes proposed in the city  b ensure that the voters of redondo beach receive all necessary and accurate environmental information on proposals for major changes in allowable land use so that they may intelligently vote on any such proposal  c ensure that city officials provide timely accurate and unbiased environmental review of all proposals for major changes in allowable land use so that they may minimize their adverse traffic and land use impacts and maximize neighborhood compatibility before the voters decide on any such change  d ensure that all elements of the land use change approved by the voters are implemented  and e protect the public health safety and welfare and the quality of life for all citizens living or working in the city and for all visitors to the city

any critical intersection or on any critical corridor from better than e to e or worse for purposes of determining traffic increases attributable to a major change in allowable land use baseline and projected icu and los conditions shall be determined considering weekday peak hour conditions at such time of the year when local public schools are in session 2 the density increase generated by the project produces more than twentyfive 25 additional residential dwelling units 3 the intensity of use generated by the project produces more than 40000 additional square feet of residential office or other nonresidential floor area the voters declare that dividing a major change in allowable land use that would otherwise require their approval into partial changes that would not by themselves require their approval frustrates their intent to have control over major changes in allowable land use and is contrary to the purposes of this article for the purposes of this article a significant increase occurs if the combination of a proposed minor change in allowable land use with one or more other minor or major changes in allowable land use in the same neighborhood approved within eight 8

clean water act npdes no cas614001 as well as waste discharge requirements under california law the municipal npdes permit and as a copermittee under the municipal npdes permit the city is required to adopt ordinances and implement procedures with respect to the entry of nonstormwater discharges into the municipal stormwater system  d of the municipal npdes permit requires the city to effectively prohibit nonstormwater discharges from within its boundaries into that portion of the ms4 which it owns or operates and into watercourses except where such discharges are 1 in compliance with a separate individual or general npdes permit or 2 identified and in compliance with a nonstormwater discharges of the municipal npdes permit or 3 originate from federal state or other facilities which the city is preempted from regulating and further provides that compliance with the terms of the municipal npdes permit development and implementation of the programs described in the municipal npdes permit will constitute compliance with the discharge prohibition in the municipal npdes permit  e of the municipal npdes permit requires the city to establish and maintain the legal authority necessary to control discharges to and from those portions of the ms4 over which it has jurisdiction so as to comply with the municipal npdes permit and to specifically prohibit certain discharges identified in the municipal npdes permit  f the municipal npdes permit contemplates the development of an enhanced watershed management program in which the city will participate which will in turn require the development and the implementation of programs for among other things the elimination of illicit connections and illicit discharges development planning development construction and public

1 cs eff  variance procedure 9 nature of variances the issuance of a variance pursuant to this shall be for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements set forth in this chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  1 cs eff  as amended by  1 cs eff  9 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief for purposes of this chapter the term minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice from the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  1 cs eff  as amended by  1 cs eff  9 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a public safety nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d of this chapter are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and do not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors set forth in a and the purposes of this chapter the council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  1 cs eff  swimming pool spa and hot tub code note  entitled metal unorthodox and unusual

purpose the intent of setback averaging is as follows 1 to avoid a monotonous and undifferentiated development pattern along streets by encouraging building designs with varied elevations and volumes  2 to provide greater design flexibility in the treatment of interior and exterior space  3 to achieve functionally improved floor plans  and 4 to provide for a setback area equivalent to that which would be achieved without the use of averaging and to ensure that no setback dimension is reduced to a point where it adversely affects the health safety and welfare of the neighborhood b method of

nonresidential condominium conversions a purpose this section shall provide for the regulations of ownership conversion projects where ownership of existing nonresidential buildings is subdivided for continued nonresidential use pursuant to of the state civil section recognizes that a conversion is different from new construction in that the owners of a unit in a conversion take responsibility for a building built under standards that may be less stringent than those that are currently deemed necessary and existing tenants may be displaced by a conversion a conversion also differs from a rental property in that the unit owner assumes longterm responsibility for the unit owned for the common areas of the project and the higher level of economic cost required to own instead of rent furthermore as the number of owners of a building increases it may be more difficult to bring about the timely recycling of existing uses and buildings to new uses and buildings which may become more desirable at the location therefore the intent of this section is to provide increased business ownership opportunities while at the same time mitigating the hardship caused by displacement of tenants  assuring that conversion projects maintain longterm economic value for the owner  and precluding conversions which may prolong the life of buildings not up to current standards or of uses which may not be in the long term best interests of the community or neighborhood b criteria 1 conditional use permit and map required no existing nonresidential building may be converted to a nonresidential condominium unless a conditional use permit is obtained pursuant to a tentative map or parcel map obtained pursuant to of title 10 of this addition to the criteria applicable for a conditional use permit and

design flexibility in the treatment of interior and exterior space  3 to achieve functionally improved floor plans  and 4 to provide for a setback area equivalent to that which would be achieved without the use of averaging and to ensure that no setback dimension is reduced to a point where it adversely affects the health safety and welfare of the neighborhood b method of calculating average setbacks where averaging of setbacks is permitted in a zone the following rules shall apply in determining the average setback required see illustration below 1 in residential zones the averageable width shall equal the lot width excluding required side setbacks and the minimum width of a driveway extending along the side of the building 2 in commercial and other nonresidential zones the

this section shall provide for the regulations of ownership conversion projects where ownership of existing nonresidential buildings is subdivided for continued nonresidential use pursuant to of the state civil section recognizes that a conversion is different from new construction in that the owners of a unit in a conversion take responsibility for a building built under standards that may be less stringent than those that are currently deemed necessary and existing tenants may be displaced by a conversion a conversion also differs from a rental property in that the unit owner assumes longterm responsibility for the unit owned for the common areas of the project and the higher level of economic cost required to own instead of rent furthermore as the number of owners of a building increases it may be more difficult to bring about the timely recycling of existing uses and buildings to new uses and buildings which may become more desirable at the location therefore the intent of
