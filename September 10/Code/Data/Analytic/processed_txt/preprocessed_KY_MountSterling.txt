planned unit development project 4091 purpose of planned unit development projects in general the purpose of puds are as follows a to encourage a more creative approach in land and building site planning b to encourage an efficient aesthetic and desirable use of open space c to encourage variety in physical development pattern d to achieve flexibility and incentives for development which will produce a wider range of choice in satisfying the changing needs of the developing area e to encourage renewal of older sections in the city where new development and restoration are needed to revitalize the area f to permit special consideration of property with unique features including but not limited to historical significance unusual topography landscape amenities and size and shape g to convert land so poorly developed as to be a public liability h to simplify processing of development proposals for developers and the planning commission by providing for concurrent review of land use subdivision public improvement and siting considerations 1 to accommodate condominium developments and other innovative land ownership alternatives 4092 procedure a plats all proposed puds should follow the procedure for plat preparation and subdivision approval as set forth in the subdivision regulations in addition the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat of the proposed pud to aid them in deciding the merits of the proposed project nothing herein should be construed to mean that the landowner has the inherent right to develop a pud the planning commission has the power to decide whether or not to allow the pud based on their experience knowledge public hearing and the standards set forth herein accompanying all preliminary plats shall be calculations for overall density parking requirements and other material that the commission may reasonably require if the planning commission approves the preliminary plat the developer may proceed with activities leading to final plat 49 approval providing that the project shall be developed in conformance with the approved preliminary plat b permits building permits and certificates of zoning compliance shall be required for each building in accordance with this expiration of approval approval of a pud shall expire of no substantial work on the site has begun within one 1 year of the original approval and if the project is abandoned for more than twentyfour 24 consecutive months abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have been made pursuant to the approved pud plat d recording all approved pud plats shall be recorded in the county clerks office 4093 uses and densities the uses of premises and development densities in a planned unit development project shall conform to the permitted uses and densities of the zoning district in which it is located a pud in a residential zone may contain nonresidential uses that are an integral part of a residential development logically oriented to and coordinated with the total planned unit this situation would normally arise in higher density areas an integrated development of this type shall follow amendment procedures and be approved as an integrated planned development by the appropriate legislative bodies 4094 standards a although it is permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual lot dimension and area regulations there shall be no diminution of totalequivalentiotarea parking area and loadingunloadingarearequirement that would be necessary for the equivalent amount of individual lot development however the planning commission may allow reductions in these requirements if the developer can satisfactorily prove that largescale development may permit such reductions without destroying the intent of these regulations b a oneacre minimum size is required for any pud e it is desirable that access points to all arterial streets shall be located no more frequently than one every five hundred 500 feet the planning commission may approve the platting of temporary access points in conformance with other sections of the parking and other areas used by the public at night shall be adequately lighted and private areas shall be adequately protected from such 50 lighting and any other lighting from public areas public streets may also require protection from excessive glare of lighted areas 4095 special conditions because a pud is inherently more complex than individual lot development and because every such project must be tailored to the topography and neighboring uses all standards for such projects cannot be strictly set therefore the planning commission may impose a special conditions andor require the recording of covenants for any reasonable purpose including but not limited to imposing standards for development of property in a planned unit development such development standards may include but are not limited to requirements as to the following 1 lot area 2 floor area 3 ratios of floor space to land area 4 area in which structures may be built buildable area 5 open space 6 setback lines and minimum yards 7 building separations 8 height of structures 9 signs 10 offstreet parking and loading space 11 design standards 12 phasing of development 13 any developed area where the total size and number of lots

districts where attached buildings are permitted and are permissible in approved planned unit developments when designated condominium developments shall follow the same procedure as established in the subdivisions regulations and as established for planned unit development the planning commission shall act upon condominiums in the same manned as for puds except that the overall density requirements are derived from the zoning district in which the condominium is located the commission may permit some variation from these regulations when the development is of a nonresidential nature the commission may as a condition of approval attach special requirements to ensure general conformity to municipal ordinances country resolutions or to the comprehensive plan and to ensure adequate maintenance of the development 411 development plans 4111 as a condition for zone changes the planning commission may waive the submission and requirement of a development plan as established in krs

city council shall fully examine the nature of the proposat the historical significance at buildings slated for demolition the character of the area the future use of the site and shall strive for architectural compatibility and for protection as well as promotion of the historical character of the affected area this section does not grant local bodies the authority of preventing a land owner from moving or demolishing a structure or from a building a structure otherwise permissible it is the intent of this section and review process herein established to assure that the project is well conceived if it is not this process will provide time and a forum upon which valid alternatives can be presented and considered 6051 historic structures in r1 districts it is the intent of this section to promote the preservation of old and historic structures while it is recognized that the conversion of single family structures to multifamily use is sometimes objectionable in singlefamily r1 districts it is more objectionable to see an historic structure abandoned allowed to deteriorate removed or demolished due to the following 1 inefficient design 2 difficulty in attracting large families 3 difficulty in attracting families with the resources to preserve heat and maintain the structure as a single family use 4 lack of governmental assistance programs to help the owneroccupied historic residential structure 5 inability to allow multifamily use due to single family zoning regulations and constitutional requirements where spot zoning is the only practical solution to the preservation of the structure and of the historic neighborhood character 67 6052 historical district requirements the historic district is a designated zone that may be superimposed over any other zoning district wherein the provisions of the other zoning district are applicable as well as the provisions contained herein the historic district is intended to protect the historic character to the fullest extent of those buildings and surrounding areas so designated all buildings within a historic shall not be demolished or moved without first obtaining a permit from the board of adjustment and being reviewed by the zoning commission in such instances upon proper application and notice the zoning commission and board of adjustment shall conduct a public hearing to determine if the permit should be granted the board of adjustment may seek advice from and recommendations from the planning commission any historical society architect engineer historian or other qualified person as well as governmental agencies as determined necessary by the board the applicant shall provide a response to the following qualification items a 1 its value as a reminder of the cultural or archeological heritage of the city state or country 2 its location as a site of significant local state or national event 3 its identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the development of the city state or country 4 its identification as the work of a master builder designer or architect whose work has influenced the development of the city state or country 5 its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing it architectural significance 6 its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style valuable for the study of a period method or construction or use of indigenous materials 7 its character as a geographically definable area possessing a significant concentration or continuity of sites buildings objects or structures united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development 8 its character as an established and geographically definable neighborhood united by culture architectural style of physical plan and development 68 therefore it is provided that the board of adjustment may convert old and historic structures in the r1 and historic districts to multifamily use by the granting of a conditional use in the consideration of each application the board is directed to examine the application with all zoning requirements and to make every attempt to insure that b 1 the zoning ordinance is complied with as much as possible 2 that the granting of the conditional use does not create an intolerable situation with respect to the protection of the public health safety general welfare and aesthetic character of the area 3 that all other municipal codes fire building nuisance etc are not infringed upon 4 that the conversation does not allow the structure to be substantially changed in such a manner as to substantially detract from the singlefamily architectural characteristics 5 that offstreet parking is provided and is sufficient to meet the needs of the occupants and their guests and parking areas designed for five 5 or more vehicles are screened from adjoining properties side and rear by strict compliance with the landscaping
