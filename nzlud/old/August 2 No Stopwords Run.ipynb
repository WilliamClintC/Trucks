              "\"\\nThe get_matches function is the first step of the matching process. For each input file, it first completes a set of  \\nof text pre-processing tasks. It then finds any general keywords in biglist, which has keywords separated by \\nquestion (measure), and then retrieves the keyword and the surrounding x characters, depending on the measure. This \\nprocess is meant to narrow searches to codes related to zoning and land use. The output from this step is a list of lists. \\n\\nNext, the get_matches function looks for more specific keywords, each of which has an associated weight that \\nwill be used to determine the value of a particular measure indicator. Consequently, this step produces a list of \\nlists of lists. The largest list is every match (represented by 'matches') which is the final return of get_matches. \\nWithin matches, there are 27 elements, all of which are lists, each one corresponding to a question (measure). Each of these \\nquestion lists is then a list of the actual matches. This method was used to organize our matches by question (measure).\\n\\nFor example:\\nmatches[0] would return a list of matches for question (measure) 1.\\nmatches[0][0] would return the first matches for question (measure) 1, which would look something like \\n['building permit','single family]\\n\\nHence, matches has three layers: \\nLayer 1 = a list of 27 lists representing the 27 question/measures\\nLayer 2 = a list of matching strings for a particular question/measure\\nLayer 3 = a list of matching keywords for a particular question/measure \\n\""
