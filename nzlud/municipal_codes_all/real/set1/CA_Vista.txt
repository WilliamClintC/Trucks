Section 2. 76.010 Purpose
A. The City Council has found and determined that mobile home parks within the
City are an important supply of housing for senior citizens and low and moderate income
persons and families. However, residents of mobile home parks, as tenants, face certain
disadvantages in their relationship with the owners of the mobile home parks, as landlords.
Both the City Council of the City and the California State Legislature have determined it is
necessary and proper for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
state and community to regulate certain aspects of the tenant- landlord relationship and other
conditions within mobile home parks. Included among the regulations adopted by the California
Legislature are the Mobile Home Residency Law, commencing with Government Code Section
798, and the various housing and other regulations included in Division 13 of the Health &
Safety Code, commencing with Section 18000.
B. For its part, the City of Vista has established a program of contractual
obligations, known as the City of Vista " Don Olmstead" Mobile Home Park Accord Program,
with owners of privately held mobile home parks within the City to encourage equitable
treatment, fair dealing and an alternative " model lease agreement" between the owners and
their tenants. An important element of the Don Olmstead Mobile Home Park Accord Program is
the provision of a means for identifying and resolving disputes between residents and owners.
Under the Accord agreements, the City Council has agreed to establish a " citizen review panel"
to receive complaints from residents and owners regarding alleged violations of the Accord, and
to seek to resolve such disputes. The establishment of the City of Vista Mobile Home Park
Review Board is intended by the City Council to fulfill the obligation to establish a citizen review
panel under the Accord Program.

Section 3. 08.060 Alternative Bidding Procedure
Rather than using the formal or informal bidding procedures of this chapter, the
Purchasing Officer may solicit bids using the following alternative bidding procedures in the
circumstances set forth in the subsections below.

purchase of highly specialized services, supplies, or equipment using the competitive negotiation

3. 08 ( 7) Vista 9/ 23/ 16)
Vista Municipal Code
shall be approached as part of the competitive negotiation process. The Purchasing Officer shall
solicit a request for proposals, a request for qualifications, or other responses from those
businesses which are engaged in the competitive negotiation process.
2. Prior to selecting a service provider, the City may engage in discussions
and negotiations with the one or more parties submitting proposals to refine the proposals,
negotiate the terms of proposals, or negotiate the fees, charges or other elements of the
proposals.
3. The use of competitive negotiations is not intended to be used for the
purpose of avoiding the bidding procedures as set forth in this chapter.
B. Professional Services. A request for proposals or a request for qualifications shall
be used when the City solicits the services of attorneys, accountants, architects, engineers or
specialized consultants or professionals. When the City seeks a combination of equipment and
professional services, the Purchasing Officer, in his or her discretion, shall choose whether to use
a request for proposal process, as provided in this section, or the formal or informal procedures
as provided in this chapter.
1. Requests for proposals, or statements of qualifications, shall include the
following information: scope of work; plans and specifications, if applicable; time schedule; cost;
insurance requirements; and list of employees who will be assigned to the project, and their
qualifications.
2. Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated according to: experience and
expertise in the field; quality of consultant's work; ability of firm or consultant to meet project
deadlines; demonstrated competence necessary for the performance of the services required;
professional qualifications; overall cost of the service; and, past performance on similar projects.
3. Prior to selecting a service provider, the City may engage in discussions
and negotiations with one or more parties submitting proposals to refine the proposals, negotiate
the terms of proposals, or negotiate the fees, charges or other elements of the proposals.
4. In the event there is only one individual or firm that can provide or is
especially suited to providing the required professional service in a timely manner, the Purchasing
Officer may waive the requirements for solicitation of multiple proposals.
C. Cooperative Purchasing. The Purchasing Officer shall have the authority to join
with other public or quasi- public agencies in cooperative purchasing plans or programs for the
purchase of supplies, services and/ or equipment by contract, arrangement, or agreement as
allowed by law, provided that the Purchasing Officer determines that participation is in the City' s
best interests and the administering agency has made its purchases in a competitive manner. In
addition, the Purchasing Officer may buy directly from a vendor at a price established by another
public agency when the other public agency has made its purchase in a competitive manner.
D. Additional Quantities. Following the execution of a contract or purchase order for
supplies, materials, or equipment, the Purchasing Officer may purchase additional quantities at
the quoted price, if such an option for additional quantities is offered by vendor and an
unencumbered balance of an allocated appropriation is available.
E. Emergencies. In an emergency, the City Manager may use the alternative bidding
procedure set forth in this paragraph. Procurements using this procedure shall be limited to
goods, services or public projects that are of an urgent nature, directly and immediately required
due to the emergency. No individual procurement using this procedure shall exceed $ 250, 000.
The City Manager shall use his or her best efforts to secure the lowest possible price for goods
or services that satisfies the City' s needs for quality and timely delivery. Promptly following the
approval of the purchase, the City Manager shall prepare a signed certificate identifying the
emergency and the need for the goods or services. The certificate shall be delivered to the City
Council.

including any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging
house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or

Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of
any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of
owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the
operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than
an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of
space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise,
including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature without any
deduction therefrom whatsoever.
Tax Administrator" means the City Clerk-Treasurer.*
Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such
person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30
days has expired, unless there is an agreement, in writing, between the operator and the
occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a
transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to June 29, 1964,
may be considered.

Section 3. 52.030 Definitions
The words and phrases used in this Chapter shall have the same meaning as defined by
or given in the law, except as otherwise defined in this section.
Employee" means all persons employed or otherwise engaged in the operation of a
business and includes, but is not limited to, employees, family members, partners, agents and
subcontractors. For businesses with part time, occasional, or seasonal employees, the number
of employees is determined first by calculating the number of full time equivalent employees on
an annual basis. The number of full time equivalent employees is determined by the actual or
estimated total number of hours worked by all part time, occasional, or seasonal employees
during the immediate prior fiscal year of the business, then, by dividing that number by 2, 000.
The resulting quotient shall be rounded to the next lowest whole number. The result shall be
the number of full time equivalent employees. The number of full time equivalent employees
shall then be added to the number of all regular full time employees.
Business Classification" means a category of business, including a retail, service,
restaurant, professional, wholesale or manufacturing business, or a financial institution. Where
such type or class of business is defined by any law or by any ordinance or code of the City of
Vista, such definition shall be used. Otherwise, the definition of the classification of the
business most often used in describing such business shall be applied.

1. The application is incomplete or inaccurate.
2. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at an address
that appears on a license that is suspended, has been revoked, or is subject to suspension or
revocation proceedings for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter; provided, however,
3. 56 ( 3) Vista 10/ 14/ 16)
Vista Municipal Code
this subparagraph shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if either or both of the
following apply:
a. The applicant provides the City with documentation demonstrating
that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the premises or business in an arm' s length
transaction. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an " arm' s length transaction" is defined as
sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open
market between two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate in
the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for the
primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this chapter that occurred at the
location, is presumed not to be an " arm' s length transaction."
b. It has been more than three years since the most recent license
for that location was revoked.
3. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a proprietor
for which or whom a suspension is in effect or by a proprietor which or who has had a license
revoked, pursuant to this chapter.
4. The application seeks an authorization for tobacco retailing that is
unlawful pursuant to this code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state, or federal
law.
5. The City has information that the applicant or his or her agents or
employees have violated any local, state, or federal tobacco control law at the location for which
the license or renewal of the license is sought within the preceding 30 day period.
6. The issuance of a tobacco retail license would be in conflict with any
other City ordinance.
B. Beginning from the effective date of this ordinance, all current licenses and any
new licenses issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall expire on June 30, 2011,
regardless of the date of issuance and then June 30, annually, thereafter, unless prior thereto
revoked by the City. An application to renew such license shall be made no later than 30 days
prior, but no earlier than 60 days prior to the expiration of the license. A license may be
renewed annually by submitting a tobacco retail license application to the Finance Department
along with payment of a tobacco retail licensing fee; provided, however, a tobacco retail license
that is suspended, has been revoked, or is subject to suspension or revocation proceedings
shall not be renewed. The applicant shall follow all of the procedures and provide all of the
information required by Section 3. 56.050 above. The City shall process the application
according to the provisions of this section.
C. If the information required in the license application pursuant to Section
3. 56.050( C), items 1, 2, or 3, changes, a new tobacco retail license is required before the
business may continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a
license has been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply for a new license
prior to acting as a retailer at the new location. If the business is sold, the new owner must
apply for a license for that location before acting as a tobacco retailer.
D. A tobacco retail license that is not timely renewed pursuant to this chapter shall
be automatically suspended by operation of law. If not renewed, a license shall be
automatically revoked two years after the renewal date. To reinstate the paid status of a license
that has been suspended due to the failure to timely pay the renewal fee, the tobacco retailer
must:
1. Submit the renewal fee plus a reinstatement fee of ten percent of the
renewal fee; and
2. Submit a signed affidavit affirming that he or she has not sold any
tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia during the period the license was suspended for
failure to pay the renewal fee.

Department. Any peace officer or code compliance official also may enforce this chapter. The
San Diego Sheriff's Department shall check compliance of each tobacco retailer at least one
time per 12 month period and shall conduct additional compliance checks as warranted. The
compliance checks shall be conducted to determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco retailer is
complying with tobacco laws regulating underage sales. The San Diego Sheriff's Department
shall use youth decoys and comply with protocols for the compliance checks developed in
consultation with the San Diego County Department of Health and Human Services and the San
Diego District Attorney. When appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance
with other tobacco- related laws.
C. The City shall not enforce any tobacco- related minimum- age law against a
person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of a person' s age ( hereinafter
youth decoy") if the potential violation occurs when:
1. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a
peace officer or a Code compliance official; or
2. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part by
the San Diego County Department of Health and Human Services or funded in part, either

license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such
constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such
application may be made before, at or within six months after payment of the prescribed license
tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show the method of
business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other
information as the collector may reasonably deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if
any, of such undue burden or violation. Such other information shall include:

in taking orders.
C. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained
the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount
that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order
a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be
charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross
receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform
with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not
exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the collector determine the gross
receipts measure of the license tax to be the proper basis, he may require the applicant to
submit, either at the time of termination of applicant’s business in the city, or at the end of each
three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax
therefore, provided that no additional license tax during any one tax period shall be required
after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this
chapter.

Section 5.04.390 Measure of Tax
A. With respect to those businesses as to which the amount of tax to be paid is
measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts which are the measure of the tax are those
received during the tax period to be covered by the license to be issued. However, since such
receipts are not known when the tax is due, the amount of such tax to be paid on the due date
shall be based on the gross receipts of the business received during the calendar year next
preceding such tax period if the business was carried on during the entirety of such next
preceding calendar year, and otherwise shall be based on an estimate of the gross receipts for
the tax period provided for in Section 5.04.150.
B. If the amount of tax paid was based on the gross receipts for such next
preceding calendar year, the person making such payment may apply to the collector for a
refund pursuant to Section 5.04.290 if the gross receipts for such calendar year were more than
the actual gross receipts received during the tax period.
C. If the amount of tax paid was based on an estimate of gross receipts, the
procedure for final ascertainment of the correct amount of the tax and the collection of any
underpayment provided in Section 5.04.150 shall be applicable; provided, however, that if such
final ascertainment results in the licensee being entitled to a refund, the procedure for
application, determination and payment provided in Section 5.04.290 shall be applicable.

circumstances peculiar to it, as distinguished from other businesses of the same kind, he may
apply to the collector for reclassification. Such application shall contain such information as the
collector may reasonably deem necessary and require in order to determine whether the
applicant’s individual business is properly classified. The collector shall then conduct an
investigation following which he shall assign the applicant’s individual business to the
classification shown to be proper on the basis of such investigation. The proper classification is
that classification which most nearly fits the applicant’s individual business. The reclassification
shall not be retroactive, but shall apply at the time of the next regularly ensuing calculation of
the applicant’s tax. No business shall be classified more than once in any one tax period.
B. The collector shall notify the applicant of the action taken on the application for
reclassification. Such notice shall be given by serving it personally or by depositing in the

Manager shall thereupon fix a time and place of hearing application for reclassification. The
City Clerk shall give the applicant at least ten days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing in
the manner prescribed above for serving notice of the action taken on the application for

Section 5. 24.010 Purpose and Intent
A. The City Council of the City of Vista encourages the development of arts and
culture, and recognizes that many entertainment establishments contribute to that goal. While
these venues can enhance the community, entertainment establishments sometimes generate
excessive noise or disorderly conduct by patrons. This can be particularly true at closing times,
with the attendant adverse public safety impact on the surrounding business and residential
community.
B. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the operations of
entertainment establishments for the public safety. It is not the City's intent to regulate or restrict
the type or content of entertainment provided in those establishments. All permittees and
responsible persons will be held responsible for controlling patron conduct in and around the
establishments, making adequate provisions for security and crowd control, protecting the City' s
youth, and taking actions to minimize or eliminate public disturbances and criminal activity which
may result from, or be associated with, the operation of the entertainment establishment.
C. The City Council finds that the imposition of appropriate conditions, using the
procedures established by this chapter, will allow entertainment establishments to effectively
operate while meeting the City's public safety needs.

over, in direct contravention by grantee of a final valid order of the City expressed by resolution
and affirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon notice requiring grantee to cease and

Section 5. 32.070 Construction of Franchise - Interpretation
Unless otherwise specifically prescribed in this chapter, the following provisions shall
govern the interpretation and construction of a franchise:
A. Time is of the essence. Neither the grantee nor the City shall be relieved of its
obligation to promptly comply with any provision of this chapter, or with the ordinance granting
the franchise, by failure of the City or the grantee to enforce prompt compliance with the same
or any other provision.
B. Any right or power conferred, or duty imposed upon any officer, employee,
department, or board of the City, is subject to transfer by operation of law to any other officer,
employee, department, or board of the City.
C. The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss,
costs, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of a franchise or the
lawful enforcement thereof.
D. A franchise does not relieve the grantee of any requirement of the City or of any
ordinance, rule, regulation, or specification of the City, including, but not limited to, any
requirement relating to street work, street excavation permits or the use, removal, or relocation
of property in streets.
E. The granting of a franchise, or any of the provisions contained in this chapter,
shall not be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical or similar franchise to any
person or corporation other than the grantee, so long as such other franchise includes
essentially the same material terms and conditions of any franchise previously issued under this
chapter.
Prior Code 6C-4. 1; Ord. No. 87- 30, Amended 8/ 24/ 87)
Section 5. 32.080 Construction of Franchise - Limitations Upon Grant
A. No privilege or exemption is granted or conferred by a franchise except those
specifically prescribed in this chapter.
B. Any privilege claimed under a franchise by the grantee in any street is
subordinate to any prior lawful permanent occupancy of the street. The City reserves the right
to reasonably designate where a grantee' s facilities are to be placed within the public ways.
C. A franchise is a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It
cannot in any event be transferred in part, and it is not to be sold, transferred, leased, merged,
assigned, or disposed of as a whole, either by forced sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise,
without prior consent of the City expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions
as may be therein prescribed; provided, however, that no such consent shall be unreasonably
5. 32 (6) Vista 6/ 24/ 16)
Vista Municipal Code
withheld, nor be required for any intercorporate transfer, or for any transfer in trust, mortgage, or
other hypothecation, as a whole, to secure an indebtedness.
D. The grantee shall at all times comply with all applicable present and future rules
of the Federal Communications Commission.
E. A grantee shall, at all times during the life of its franchise, be subject to the lawful
exercise of the City' s police power and such reasonable regulations as the Council may
subsequently promulgate thereunder.
F. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit in any way the right
of the City to provide, for consideration, rights, or privileges in addition to those set forth in
Section 5. 32. 050.
G. Any franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any obligations involved in
obtaining pole or conduit space from any department of the City, utility company, or from others
maintaining utilities in the public ways.
H. Whenever, in the judgment of the grantor, it is deemed impracticable to permit
erection of poles or construction of underground conduit system by any utility which may at the
time have authority to construct or maintain a conduit or poles in street area, the grantor may,
where not inconsistent with good engineering practices, require the grantee to afford to such
utility the right to use such poles or facilities of the grantee as the grantor finds practicable in
common with the grantee, both as they may agree upon, but in case they fail to agree within a
reasonable time, then upon such terms, conditions, and regulations governing the same as the
grantor may determine to be just and reasonable. Grantee may impose reasonable conditions
and fees for such use.
I. Any franchise granted shall be in lieu of any and all other conflicting rights,
privileges, powers, immunities and authorities owned, possessed, controlled, or exercisable
under other City law or regulation by grantee, or any successor to any interest of grantee, of or
pertaining to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any cable communications system
in the city, and shall be construed as an abandonment of any and all of such rights, privileges,
powers, immunities and authorities within the city to the effect that, as between grantee and the
City, and all construction, operation, and maintenance by any grantee of any cable
communications system in the city shall be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances
and respects to be under and pursuant to said franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other
right, privilege, power, immunity, or authority whatsoever.
J. No franchise shall authorize use of any public property other than public right-ofway
and public utility easements owned by the City, unless such franchise or subsequent
resolution of the Council expressly authorizes such other public property.
K. Grantee is subject to all provisions of the other ordinances, rules, regulations,
and other provisions of the City heretofore or hereafter adopted, including, but not limited to,
those pertaining to works and activities in, on, over, under, and about public rights-of-way.
L. Any privilege claimed, under such franchise granted, in any public right- of-way or
other public property is subordinate to the public use thereof.
M. Grantee is subject to the provisions of general laws of the State of California or
as hereafter amended, when applicable to the exercise of any privilege contained in any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to works
and activities in and about state highways.
N. Grantee is prohibited from directly or indirectly doing any of the following:
1. Soliciting, referring or causing or permitting the solicitation or referral of
any subscriber to persons engaged in any business prohibited in this chapter to be engaged in
by grantee.
2. Providing information concerning the viewing patterns of identifiable
subscribers to any group, organization, or person for any purposes.

3. Install, maintain, or operate on any television set a coin box or any other
device or means for on- site collection of money for individual programs.
O. If the Federal Communications Commission or any other federal or state body or
agency now or hereafter exercises any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of any
franchise granted, then to the extent such jurisdiction preempts or precludes the exercise of like
jurisdiction by the City, the jurisdiction of the City shall cease and no longer exist.
P. The preemption or preclusion of the exercise by the City of any of its police
power shall not diminish, impair, or affect any other contractual benefit to the City or grantee nor
any contractual obligation of the grantee under the franchise granted.
Q. Any and all minimum standards governing the operations of grantee and any and
all minimum rates, ratios, and charges specified in any franchise granted, existing now and at
any time in the future, including such time as any paramount jurisdiction preempts or precludes
that of the City, and any and all rights, powers, privileges, and authorities of the City to
determine, establish, or fix any of the same, are each and all declared by the City and by any
grantees accepting any franchise to be contractual in nature and to be for the benefit of the City.
R. The form of the grantee' s contract with the subscriber shall also be subject to
review and comment by the City.
S. It is not the City' s intention to prohibit the erection or controlled use of individual
television antennas, and no one is or will be required to receive cable communications service
or connect with a cable communications system.
T. Should the grantee ever fail to pay any sum of money to the City, owed to the
City under provisions of this chapter, or the franchise ordinance, when such sum becomes due
and payable, grantee shall pay interest to the City on the delinquent sum, until it is fully paid at
two interest points above the prime rate of interest charged in the San Diego area as calculated
by the City.
U. A franchise to proceed with operation, or construction and operation, of a cable
communications system shall not be construed as any limitation upon the right of the City to
grant to other persons or corporations, rights, privileges, or authority in the same or other
streets, alleys, public highways, public places, or other public rights- of-way by agreement,
franchise, permit, or otherwise.

impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, either by purchase or through the exercise of the right

franchise itself or any of the rights or privileges granted thereby, and nothing contained in this
chapter shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, whether for a term or in
perpetuity, the City' s right of eminent domain.
C. There is reserved to the City every right and power which is required to be
reserved or provided by law, and the grantee, by its acceptance of the franchise, agrees to be

A. The service provided by the grantee under a franchise may be required to

than 24 months thereafter. Except as may be preempted by federal or state law at the time
approaching franchise expiration, to assure continued service to the subscribers, the City shall
issue a request for proposals for a replacement franchise not later than 24 months prior to
expiration of a franchise. The RFP shall include the minimum acceptable level of system
capability, services, rates, access, etc., as determined by the City, to meet the needs of the
Vista community. If the Council deems grantee' s past performance to warrant consideration for
franchise renewal, then the City shall provide grantee first right of refusal in accepting the
franchise offered. However, if the Council deems grantee' s past performance to not warrant
such consideration, or if grantee elects to not accept the franchise offered under its first right of
refusal, then the City may solicit other applications with the understanding that no further
consideration will be given to awarding the incumbent grantee a replacement franchise.
B. Franchises will normally not be renewed for periods in excess of 15 years, and
may be renewed prior to expiration of an existent franchise in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Subsection A of this section.
C. If the City Council elects to provide the incumbent grantee the first right of refusal
addressed in Subsection C of this section, then the RFP issued by the City shall advise other
potential applicants accordingly, and will provide for the full return of any application fee
received from an applicant other than the incumbent in the event the incumbent accepts the
franchise offered and the other applicant(s) withdraws.
D. If the City Council after public hearing elects to not consider the incumbent
grantee for a replacement franchise, then it shall do so by resolution after public hearing and
prior to issuance of an RFP for the replacement franchise. The City shall not arbitrarily or
unreasonably deny consideration of the incumbent grantee, nor shall consideration be denied
for reasons outside grantee' s reasonable control. However, if the City does so elect, the City
may purchase or require any successor grantee to purchase grantee' s facilities for a cost not to
exceed its fair market value, with a reduction for any uncompensated damages incurred by the
City in connection with grantee' s operation as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Fair market value to be determined in accordance with the process set forth in Section 5. 32. 060

themselves.
E. Upon request of the grantee, or the City, the grantee and the City shall

grantee shall be deemed to have rejected and repudiated the franchise. Thereafter, the
acceptance of the grantee shall not be received nor filed by the City Clerk. Except as may be
provided by federal or state laws, the grantee shall have no rights, remedies, or redress in the
premises, unless and until the Council, by resolution, determines that such acceptance be
received or filed, and then upon such terms and conditions as the Council may impose.
D. In any case, and in any instance, all rights, remedies, and redress which may or
are available to the City, shall at all times be available to the City, and shall be preserved and
maintained and shall continuously exist in and to the City, and shall not be in any manner or
means modified, abridged, altered, restricted, or impaired by reason of any of these premises or
otherwise.
E. Any franchise granted and accepted under this chapter shall be in lieu of any and
all other conflicting rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed,

B. The grantee shall promptly notify the City of any proposed change in, or transfer
of, or acquisition by, any other party of control of the grantee with respect to which the consent
of the grantor is required, pursuant to Subsection A of this section. Such change of control shall

C. Consent of the Council shall not be granted until it has examined the proposed
assignee' s legal, financial, technical, character, and other qualifications to construct, operate,
and maintain a cable communications system in the city and has afforded all interested parties
notice and an opportunity to be heard on the question. The grantee shall assist the City in any
such examination.
D. The said consent of the Council may not be unreasonably refused; provided,
however, the proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by Council
and this chapter; and provided further, that no such consent is required for a transfer in trust,
mortgage, or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except that

copy of such notices will be sent, via regular mail to the City' s Director of Public Works. A
second notice, more definitive as to timing of the opening of the trench, will be required at least
30 days before such opening. If the developer fails, without due cause, to properly notify
grantee, then the City shall request the developer to reopen the trenches or grantee may seek
compensation from the developer for any necessary construction, at cost of labor and materials
only, and only for that portion exceeding standard costs incurred if the trench had been open. In
the event the developer for reasons beyond his reasonable control, is unable to meet such
timing of notices, and does, however, provide grantee the earliest practicable notice, then
grantee shall make every reasonable effort to fully respond despite the lesser time in
notification. If grantee does not, or is not able to so respond, then the City may require both
parties to submit any resultant disagreement for cost of installation of plant to binding arbitration.
Grantee is responsible for the conduct of the engineering and labor to put the cable conduit in

Bond
A. The grantee shall, at his sole expense, at the time of acceptance of a franchise,
file with the City, and unless otherwise authorized by Council, at all times thereafter, maintain in
full force and effect, an acceptable corporate surety bond, in duplicate, in the amount of
100, 000 effective for the entire term of the franchise, and conditioned that in the event the
grantee shall fail to comply with any one or more of the material provisions of a franchise, then
there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond, any
damages suffered by the City as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of property as prescribed by Sections
5. 32.410 or 5. 32. 260 of this chapter which may be in default, up to the full amount of the bond,
said condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of a franchise and thereafter until the
grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the City that may have arisen from the
acceptance of a franchise by the grantee or from its exercise of any privilege granted in this
chapter.
B. Neither the provisions of this section, any bond accepted by the City pursuant
thereto, nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder shall be construed to excuse faithful
performance by grantee or to limit liability of the grantee under a franchise or for damages,
either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.
C. If, at any time during the term of the franchise, the condition of the corporate
surety shall change in such a manner as to render the bond unsatisfactory to the City, the
grantee shall replace such bond by a bond of like count and similarly conditioned, issued by a
corporate surety satisfactory to the City. In the event the grantee' s obligations under a franchise
shall so warrant, the Council, from time to time, may authorize or require appropriate
adjustments in the amount of the bond. For example, the amount of the bond may be reduced
by grantee, with the prior approval of Council, at satisfactory completion of system construction,
upgrade and/ or extension, as may be set forth in the franchise agreement.

A. Within 30 days after the effective date of the franchise, grantee shall deposit into

sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount.
C. If the grantee fails, after ten days notice to pay the City any taxes or payments

grantee in connection with a franchise; or fail after 30 days notice by the City of such failure to
comply with any provision of the franchise which the City reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security, the City may immediately withdraw the amount
5. 32 ( 26) Vista 6/ 24/ 16)

thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the City
shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof.
D. The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the property of

revoked for cause. The grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund,
or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the franchise, or upon
termination of the franchise at an earlier date, provided that there is then no outstanding default
on the part of the grantee.

proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right
the City may have.

The City Council declares the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the public against
fraud, deceit and imposition, and to foster and encourage fair solicitations or sales solicitations
for charitable purposes, wherein the person from whom the money is being solicited will know
what portion of the money will actually be utilized for charitable purposes. This chapter will
promote legitimate solicitations and sales solicitations for charitable purposes and restrict
harmful solicitation methods, thus the people of this city will not be misled into giving solicitors a
substantial amount of money which may not in fact be used for charitable purposes.

Section 5.76.010 Background
Swap meets have developed into a large commercial enterprise in the city and
surrounding areas in San Diego County involving many citizens and attracting out-of-city/ county
and out- of-state participants. At the present time there are no regulations controlling their
operation. Swap meets should be subject to the necessary regulatory provisions that apply to
any other business in this city. Investigation has shown that both new and used items and
stolen merchandise are sold. There are special regulations, both local and state, on pawn
shops and because they are especially susceptible places to dispose of stolen goods, most
certainly similar control should be applicable to swap meets.

Grading of Mobile Food Facilities Regulations Adopted
Sections:
8. 26.010 Purpose and Intent
8. 26.020 Adoption of County Regulations for Grading of Mobile Food Facilities
8. 26.030 Fees
Section 8. 26.010 Purpose and Intent
Fixed location food facilities throughout San Diego County are currently scored against
food safety criteria by County inspectors, and assigned a letter grade based on that score.
Mobile food facilities are not graded. To better inform the public, the County is extending the
letter grade system currently used for restaurants to mobile food facilities. In the unincorporated
County, this will be done by enacting a change in the County Code of Regulatory Ordinances,
sections 61. 101 to 61. 115 of Chapter 1, Division 1, Title 6. These changes will improve public
information; help customers easily identify vendors in good compliance and provide more
information about the overall condition of the mobile food facilities to make safe dinning choices.
Mobile food facilities operate in multiple jurisdictions. Grading is a local program in each
County unincorporated area and City, not a state law program. Therefore, establishing an
effective grading system for mobile food facilities requires cooperation across city boundaries,
allowing the County the authority to enforce posting of letter grades in all local jurisdictions.
This ordinance provides for City cooperation in a coordinated regional program by ( 1)
adopting the County changes to the restaurant grading ordinance by reference; and ( 2) by
requiring that grade cards be posted by mobile food facilities that prepare food and that permit
fees to provide cost recovery are paid by operators of mobile food facilities that prepare food.
Ord. No. 2012- 10, Added, 10/ 9/ 12)
Section 8. 26.020 Adoption of County Regulations for Grading of Mobile Food

Diego County, State of California, for the purpose of grading of permanent and mobile food
facilities that prepare food, that certain code known as the San Diego County Code of
Regulatory Ordinances, at Title 6, Division 1.
A copy of the San Diego County Code of Regulatory Ordinances has been and is
now filed in the Office of the Clerk of the City of Vista, and it is hereby adopted and incorporated
as though fully set out at length herein. From the date on which this ordinance shall take effect,
the provisions thereof shall be controlling within the limits of the City of Vista.

modifications thereto, or to the immediate area surrounding such surface, according to the
following provisions and procedures. Said surface or surfaces may be retrofitted to the

City' s option, with such features or material as may be necessary to reduce the attractiveness of
the surface for graffiti, or as necessary to permit more convenient or efficient removal of graffiti,

repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or
unless the responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more
extensive area.
2. Consent to enter; abatement upon failure to obtain consent.

provisions of this section, the City may commence Abatement and Cost Recovery Proceedings
for the removal of the graffiti according to the following procedure:
C. Abatement of nuisance and cost of abatement.
1) Notice and conduct of abatement hearing. The City
Manager, or his or her designee (" Hearing Officer"), shall give not less than 48 hours notice of a
hearing to be held by the Hearing Officer for the purpose of showing cause why the public
nuisance should not be abated by the City. The notice shall be served upon the responsible

of the property on which the public nuisance is located in the same manner as provided for
service of a summons in accordance with Article 3 ( commencing with Section 415. 10) of
Chapter 4, Title 5, Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record of the subject
property on which the public nuisance is located cannot be found after diligent search, the
notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place upon the property
for a period of at least ten days and by publishing said notice in a newspaper of general
circulation within San Diego County in the manner provided by Section 6062 of the Government
Code. Following proper notice, the hearing shall be held by the Hearing Officer at the time,
date, and place designated and at such hearing the responsible party and the owner of record
of the property may each be heard and provided with the opportunity to show cause why the
nuisance should not be abated. Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall determine
whether abatement of the nuisance shall be commenced. The decision of the Hearing Officer is
final and is not subject to appeal to the City Council.
2) Abatement of Nuisance. If the Hearing Officer determines
that abatement of the nuisance shall be commenced, a written notice (" Eradication Order") shall
be issued to the responsible party; and the owner of record if known, providing that if the public
nuisance is not removed within five days, the City shall enter upon the property and cause such
nuisance to be removed in the manner determined most appropriate by the Hearing Officer.
Upon removal of the public nuisance, the City shall provide an accounting of the costs of
abatement along with a demand for payment to the responsible party, and to the owner of
record if known.

shall be subject to a penalty assessment of $ 100 plus interest on the unpaid amount plus
penalty, which interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent per month until paid. Either the
responsible party or the owner of record may protest the amount of the costs of abatement by
filing a written letter of protest of the amount within the 60- day period from the date issued. The
letter of protest shall set forth the basis for the protest. Upon receiving a letter of protest, the
Hearing Office shall set the matter for a hearing by the City Council. At such hearing, the City
Council shall determine the protest.
4) Lien on property upon determination of protest or
nonpayment. Upon determination of a protest of the cost of abatement by the City Council, or in
the event there is no protest and the cost of abatement has not been paid within 60 days from
the date of issuing an accounting and demand for payment, the amount unpaid including any
penalty and interest thereon, shall constitute a lien and an assessment on the property pursuant
to Section 38773, et seq., of the Government Code. The Hearing Officer shall record a notice of
lien and assessment on the official records of the County Recorder. Any such liens or
assessments not paid by June 30 of each year shall upon adoption of a resolution by the City
Council, be collected along with, and in the same manner as, the general property taxes.

Section 9.08.010 Curfew - Persons under 18 Years of Age
A. Purpose and Intent. The City Council of Vista is concerned with the level of
juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity, and juvenile crime in the City of Vista. The crimes being
committed by juveniles include serious offenses such as murder, drive- by shootings, drug- related
crimes and other gang- related activities. Juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of
maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gang- related activities and to be victims of
older perpetrators of crimes. Recent local statistics regarding juvenile crime and victimization
indicate that enforcement of a curfew for juveniles decreases the percentage of juvenile
victimization and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes during curfew hours.
Therefore, having an enforceable juvenile curfew ordinance is critical to preserving the public
health, safety and welfare.
B. Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms shall be defined as
follows:

4. Guardian" means a person who, under court order, is the guardian of the
person of a minor, or public or private agency with whom a minor has been placed by the court.
5. Minor" means any person under 18 years of age.
6. Parent" means a person who is a natural parent, adoptive parent, or stepparent
of another person.
7. Public Place" means any place to which the public or a substantial
group of the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, highways, and the
common areas of schools, hospitals, apartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities, and
shops.
8. Responsible Adult" means a person at least 18 years of age, authorized
by a parent or guardian to have the care and custody of a minor.
9. Serious Bodily Injury" means bodily injury that creates a substantial risk
of death or that causes death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or
impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.
C. Curfew Restrictions. It is unlawful for any minor to be present in any public place
or on the premises of any establishment within the City of Vista during curfew hours.

permit, or by insufficient control to allow the minor to be present in any public place or on the

more adults and sponsored by the City of Vista, a civic organization, or another similar entity
that takes responsibility for the minor.
8. Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution.
9. Emancipated pursuant to law.
F. Before taking any enforcement action under this section, a law enforcement
officer shall ask the apparent offender's age and reason for being in the public place or on the
premises of the establishment during curfew hours. The law enforcement officer shall not issue
a citation or make an arrest under this section unless the officer reasonably believes that an
offense has occurred and that, based on any responses and other circumstances, no defense
under Subsection E is present or applicable.

Section 9. 12. 010 Legislative Purpose
It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate the operations of adult businesses,
which have judicially recognized adverse secondary effects on the community, including, but not
limited to, increases in crime in the vicinity of adult businesses; decreases in property values in
the vicinity of adult businesses; increases in vacancies in residential and commercial areas in
the vicinity of adult businesses; interference with residential property owners' enjoyment of their
properties when such properties are located in the vicinity of adult businesses as a result of
increases in crime, litter, noise, and vandalism; and the deterioration of neighborhoods. Special
regulation of these businesses is necessary to prevent these adverse secondary effects and the
blighting or degradation of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of adult businesses while at the
same time protecting the First Amendment rights of those individuals who desire to own,
operate or patronize those certain adult-oriented businesses which have such First Amendment
protection.

Article 2 Adult-Oriented Business Performer License
Section 9. 12. 110 Purpose
It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide for the licensing of adult- oriented
business performers in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the City. The
goals of the performer licensing provisions are ( 1) to protect minors by requiring that all
performers be over the age of 18 years; (2) to assure the correct identification of persons
performing in adult-oriented businesses; ( 3) to enable the City to deploy law enforcement
resources effectively; and ( 4) to detect and discourage the involvement of crime in adultoriented
businesses by precluding the licensing of performers with certain sex- related
convictions in a set time period. It is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations to
invade the privacy of performers or to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any
communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations to
restrict or deny access by adults to communicative materials or to deny access by the
distributors or exhibitors of adult- oriented businesses to their intended lawful market. Nothing in
these regulations is intended to authorize, legalize, or permit the establishment, operation, or
maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any City ordinance or any statute
of the state of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual
conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter, or the exhibition or public display thereof.

of a completed adult-oriented business performer application and payment of the license fee
specified in Section F above, the Chief of Police shall immediately issue a temporary license

H. This temporary adult-oriented business performer license shall authorize a
performer to commence performance at an adult-oriented business establishment that

I. The fact that a license applicant possesses other types of state or City permits or
licenses does not exempt the license applicant from the requirement of obtaining an adultoriented
business performer license.

Section 9. 30.010 Findings and Purpose
The City Council of the City of Vista hereby finds that the increased placement and use
of automatic cash dispensing machines and automated bank teller machines, otherwise known
as " ATMs," provide for the public convenience and promote beneficial economic activity within
the community, however the placement and increased use of ATMs is causing increased
exposure of the public to certain criminal activities including, for example robberies and assaults,
and provides new opportunities and incentives for criminal conduct. The City Council finds,
therefore, that new and additional means must be provided to maintain effective law
enforcement and to enable law enforcement officers to prevent such criminal activity. The City
Council further finds that citizens of the community are expressing heightened anxiety and fear
of becoming victims of criminal activity when using ATMs for their legitimate purposes.
The purposes of this ordinance are:
A. To set standards and regulate conduct of the public in and around the immediate
vicinity of any ATM machines by prohibiting loitering.
B. To enhance the well- being of the public using ATMs for their legitimate purposes.
C. To provide law enforcement officers with greater means of preventing and
controlling criminal activity near and around ATMs.

Spectators Prohibited at Illegal Speed Contests or Exhibitions of Speed

9. 36. 030 Spectator at Illegal Speed Contest or Exhibition of Speed - Violation
9. 36. 040 Relevant Circumstances to Prove a Violation
9. 36.050 Admissibility of Prior Acts
Section 9. 36.010 Purpose
The City Council for the City of Vista finds and declares that pursuant to California
Vehicle Code Section 23109, motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of speed conducted
on public streets and highways are illegal. Motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of
speed are commonly known as street races or drag races.
Streets within the county of San Diego have been the site of continuing and escalating
illegal street racing over the past several years. Such street racing threatens the health and
safety of the public, interferes with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, creates a public nuisance,
and interferes with the right of private business owners to enjoy the use of their property.
Illegal street racers accelerate to high speeds without regard to oncoming traffic,
pedestrians, or vehicles parked or moving nearby. Traffic accidents, property crimes, and calls
for police service have increased dramatically where these illegal activities occur.
In most cases, illegal street races attract hundreds of spectators. The mere presence of
spectators at these events fuels the illegal street racing and creates an environment in which
these activities can flourish. Specifically, racers and spectators gather late at night and in the
early morning hours, blocking the streets and sidewalks to traffic, forming a racetrack area,
placing bets, and otherwise encouraging, aiding and abetting the racing process.
This chapter makes evidence of specified prior acts admissible to show the propensity of
the defendant to be present at or attend illegal street races, if the prior act or acts occurred
within three years of the presently charged offense.
This chapter is adopted to prohibit spectators at illegal street races with the aim of
significantly curbing this criminal activity. The chapter targets a very clear, limited population
and gives proper notice to citizens as to what activities are lawful and what activities are
unlawful. In discouraging spectators, the act of organizing and participating in illegal street races
will be discouraged.

Section 9. 36.020 Definitions
The words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the same meaning as defined by

Illegal motor vehicle speed contest" or " illegal exhibition of speed" means any
speed contest or exhibition of speed which is commonly known as drag racing and referred to
in California Vehicle Code Sections 23109(a) and 23109(c).

has arrived at a location for the purpose of participating in or being spectators at the event; ( 2)

private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent

contest or exhibition of speed, or at a location where preparations are being made for such
activities, for the purpose of viewing, observing, watching, or witnessing the event as it
progresses. Spectator includes any individual at the location of the event without regard to

Section 9.40.010 Findings; Purpose
A. The City Council finds that a multifamily development which repeatedly reaches or
exceeds its threshold for service calls to the Sheriff qualifies as a noncompliant multifamily
development under this Chapter and constitutes a public nuisance. In those instances the public
health, safety and welfare require the City to work with the property owner and property manager
of the multifamily development so that the nuisance conditions associated with the multifamily
development can be eliminated and damage to the public health, safety and welfare can be
abated. These actions should help control crime, contain blight, avoid reductions in property
values, curb negative impacts on economic activity, preserve a desirable quality of life within
Vista, and control long- term enforcement costs that would otherwise be imposed by the City.
B. In an effort to abate or reduce these nuisance conditions, the City Council intends
to establish a program by which noncompliant multifamily developments are required to adopt
practices and take actions to reduce or eliminate nuisance conditions and to improve the public
health, safety and welfare. As part of this program, the owner or manager of a noncompliant
multifamily development will be required to participate in a program to secure a crime free
multifamily certification, and to take the steps required to obtain a finding of compliance in
accordance with this Chapter.
C. The City Council intends to implement this Chapter in a manner which allows the
owner of a noncompliant multifamily development to continue uninterrupted rental operations
provided that the owner is making substantial progress toward obtaining a crime free multifamily
certification.
D. The City Council also intends that the program operate in a manner to regulate the
number of noncompliant multifamily developments which enter the program in a given six-month
period, thereby facilitating a manageable and well- operated program. To advance this aim, the
City Council intends that priority shall be given to those multifamily developments which appear
to be most damaging to the Vista community as determined by the compliance officer.

Section 10. 56.010 Findings and Declarations
In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted
by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City
Council makes the following findings and declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative
vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create
a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration,
to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a
hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and
to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public
property not including highways, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is declared to
constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.

chapter, and requiring terminal access from federally designated highways, shall submit an
application and appropriate fee to the Public Works Department at City Hall. Said application is
Attachment "A" to this chapter.*
B. Upon receipt of this application, the Director of Public Works will determine the
applicant's conformance with the " terminal" designation and, if so approved, will then determine
the capability of the route requested and/ or alternate routes. Capability will be determined by the
adequate turning radii and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways. Also, a determinant
factor will be general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed, and traffic volumes for safe
operation. Access off the federally designated highways will require CalTrans ( District 11)
approval.
C. If the requested route passes through several jurisdictions ( i. e., county or other
municipality), the applicant shall comply with that jurisdiction' s application process. Coordination
will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal' s land use.

Section 12. 20.090 Signs Furthering Sports Field Use
A. The City wishes to facilitate the nonprofit use of its sports fields for sports
leagues serving children and youth, without excessive cost to the City. This use achieves a
primary purpose for which the sports fields were created. However, the City recognizes that the
nonprofit organizations, in sponsoring leagues that use the sports fields, incur substantial
financial obligations which would be borne by the City if the City operated the programs itself.
To encourage a productive use of City sports fields, by nonprofit organizations which sponsor
youth leagues, the City wishes to provide the nonprofit organizations with an opportunity to
collect revenues through paid advertising messages on signs located at sports fields, subject to
the conditions described in paragraphs ( B) and ( C).
B. All signs must satisfy the following requirements:
1. A sign face may not exceed 32 square feet in size and may not be
illuminated. The sign may not have a depth exceeding one- half of an inch, unless first approved
by the City Planner or Director of Recreation and Community Services. Only one face of a sign
shall display a message.

waterproof materials. Professional preparation consists of any image generated by use of a
computer or any other means, excluding only images created: ( 1) through free- hand writing,
drawing or painting applied directly to a sign; ( 2) stencils applied to a sign by use of spray paint,
adhesive or a similar process; or ( 3) signs produced using the methods described in the
preceding clauses and then replicated through a photocopy or similar process.
3. Signs, at minimum, must be securely attached to the fence at all four
corners. The method of attachment may not pose any hazard to those using the fields and shall
be approved by the City Planner or Director of Recreation and Community Services.
4. Signs may not project above or outside the area of the fence and may not
interfere with the reasonable use and maintenance of the sports fields.
C. No sign may be placed or maintained by a nonprofit organization unless the
organization has first executed a license agreement with the City and the sign is placed and
maintained in full conformity with that license agreement. The license agreement shall satisfy
the following, but may include additional reasonable requirements.
1. The nonprofit organization shall provide insurance, naming the City as an
additional insured, for its use of the sports field and placement of the signs.
2. Allocations of signs shall occur in proportion to the usage of individual
fields allocated for a sport season to the nonprofit organizations using those fields.
3. In order to maximize the revenue generating capacity of the signs in a
manner consistent with the intended use of the sports fields, a sign: ( a) may only present a
commercial message; ( b) may not advertise a product which is unlawful to consume or use
within the sports fields; and ( c) may not advertise a product which is unlawful for persons to
purchase or consume, if under the age of 18.
4. The nonprofit organization shall remove all signs allocated to the
organization under a license agreement within two days of the end of the sports season for
which such sign was displayed.
5. All revenues received by the nonprofit organization from the signs shall
be expended by the nonprofit organization to support the children and youth in their use of the
fields for their intended purpose, or the leagues hosting the sporting events on those fields.
6. The license agreement shall be prepared and executed by the City
Manager.
D. This ordinance permits, but does not require, the City Manager to authorize one
or more license agreements for one or more sports fields to be utilized by one or more nonprofit
organizations. Such agreements may be terminated by the City Manager pursuant to their
12. 20 (5) Vista 9/ 23/ 16)

terms. A decision to authorize a license agreement for one sports field during a season does
not obligate the City Manager to continue that practice in future seasons.
E. This ordinance is intended to be administered in conformity with all requirements
of the Federal and State Constitutions. The City Manager may prepare policies and regulations,
not in conflict with this section, for purposes of administering the program authorized by this

The City Council finds that the storage, accumulation, collection and disposal of solid

nuisance, can lead to air pollution, fire hazards, illegal dumping, insect breeding, rodent
infestation, pollution to surface waters and other problems affecting the health, welfare, and safety
of the residents of this and surrounding cities. The City Council further finds that the periodic
collection of solid waste from all real properties with Generators in the City benefits all persons in
the City as well as the greater community. Accordingly, the collection of solid waste in the City is
a mandatory service and all owners of real property with Generators as defined in Section
13. 16. 020 are made liable for the payment of such fees as may be charged from time to time by
the City' s Contractor. The City Council further declares that the regulations provided in this
chapter are designated to eliminate or alleviate such problems and to provide procedures
complying with requirements placed upon the City by other regulatory bodies.

compliance with the provisions of this chapter would create an unusual burden on the project
which is different than that of similarly situated properties; or
2. That for a specific project compliance with this chapter would result in
minimal or no increase in recycled materials or reduction in waste stream; or
3. That diversion of one or more substances involved in the project presents
unique and burdensome obstacles and would create an especially onerous economic burden on
the project unless diversion of that substance is reduced or eliminated.

findings for a project he or she may excuse the project from compliance with this chapter or
determine the maximum feasible reduced diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this
rate on the WMP submitted by the Applicant. The WMP Compliance Official shall return a copy
of the WMP to the applicant marked " Approved for Exemption" and shall notify the Community
Development Department that the WMP has been approved.

Section 13. 18.060 Exemptions to Discharge Prohibitions
A. Permitted Discharges. Any discharge to the MS4 that is regulated under an
NPDES permit issued to the discharger and administered by the State of California pursuant to
Division 7 of the California Water Code is allowed, provided that the discharger is in compliance
with all requirements of the NPDES permit and other applicable laws and regulations.
B. Groundwater Discharges Typically Requiring Permits. Non- storm water
discharges to the MS4 from the following categories are allowed if: ( i) the discharger obtains
coverage under NPDES Permit No. CAG919002 ( RWQCB Order No. R9- 2008- 0002, or
subsequent order) for discharges to surface waters other than San Diego Bay, and the discharger
is in compliance with all requirements of the applicable NPDES permit and all other applicable
laws and regulations; or( ii) the RWQCB determines in writing that coverage under NPDES Permit
No. CAG919002 ( or subsequent permit) is not required. Otherwise, non- storm water discharges
from the following categories are illicit discharges:
1. Discharges from uncontaminated pumped groundwater.
2. Discharges from foundation drains when the system is designed to be
located at or below the groundwater table to actively or passively extract groundwater during any
part of the year.
3. Discharges from water from crawl space pumps.
4. Discharges from water from footing drains when the system is designed to
be located at or below the groundwater table to actively or passively extract groundwater during
any part of the year.
C. Discharges from Water Lines. Non- storm water discharges to the MS4 from water
line flushing and water main breaks are allowed if the discharges have coverage under NPDES
Permit No. CAG679001 ( Regional Water Quality Control Board Order No. R9- 2010- 0003, or
subsequent order), and the discharger is in compliance with all requirements of that NPDES
permit and other applicable laws and regulations. This category includes water line flushing and
water main break discharges from water purveyors issued a water supply permit by the California
Department of Public Health or federal military installations. Discharges from recycled or
reclaimed water lines to the MS4 are allowed if the discharges have coverage under an NPDES
permit, and the discharger is in compliance with the applicable NPDES permit and other
applicable laws and regulations. Otherwise, discharges from water lines are illicit discharges.
D. Allowable Discharges. Non- storm water discharges to the MS4 from the following
categories are allowed, unless the enforcement official or the Regional Water Quality Control
Board identifies the discharge as a source of pollutants to receiving waters, in which case the
discharge is considered an illicit discharge:
1. Discharges from diverted stream flows.
2. Discharges from rising groundwater.
3. Discharges from uncontaminated groundwater infiltration to the MS4.
4. Discharges from springs.
5. Discharges from flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
13. 18 ( 7) Vista 9/ 23/ 16)
Vista Municipal Code
6. Discharges from potable water sources, except as set forth in Vista
Municipal Code Section 13. 18. 060. C.
7. Discharges from foundation drains when the system is designed to be
located above the groundwater table at all times of the year, and the system is only expected to
produce non- storm water discharges under unusual circumstances.
8. Discharges from footing drains when the system is designed to be located
above the groundwater table at all times of the year, and the system is only expected to produce
non- storm water discharges under unusual circumstances.
E. Conditionally Allowed Discharges. Non- storm water discharges from the following
categories are allowed if they are addressed as follows. Otherwise, non- storm water discharges
from the following categories are illicit discharges:
1. Air Conditioning Condensation. Air conditioning condensation discharges
shall comply with applicable BMPs identified in the Stormwater Standards Manual.
2. Individual Residential Vehicle Washing. Wash water from individual
residential vehicle washing must be directed to landscaped areas or other pervious surfaces,
where feasible. Where discharges cannot be feasibly prevented, BMPs must be implemented in
accordance with the Stormwater Standards Manual. Non- commercial car washes, such as
fundraisers and other similar activities, are not considered individual residential vehicle washing.
Discharges from such activities are therefore considered illegal discharges.
3. Water from swimming pools.
a. Chlorinated Swimming Pool Water. Chlorine, algaecide, filter
backwash, and other pollutants shall be eliminated prior to discharging swimming pool water to
the MS4.
b. Saline Swimming Pool Water. Saline swimming pool water must be
directed to the sanitary sewer, landscaped areas, or other pervious surfaces that can
accommodate the volume of water, unless the saline swimming pool water can be discharged
directly to a naturally saline water body.
F. Firefighting Activities. Non- storm water discharges to the MS4 from firefighting
activities are allowed if they are addressed as follows:
1. Non- Emergency Firefighting Discharges. Non- emergency firefighting
discharges, including building fire suppression system maintenance discharges( e. g. sprinkler line
flushing), controlled or practice blazes, training, and maintenance activities shall be addressed by
BMPs to prevent the discharge of pollutants to the MS4.
2. Emergency Firefighting Discharges. BMPs are encouraged to prevent
pollutants from entering the MS4. During emergencies, priority of efforts should be directed toward
life, property, and the environment( in descending order). BMPs shall not interfere with emergency
response operations or impact public health and safety.
G. Exemptions not Absolute. Notwithstanding the categories of non- storm water
discharges conditionally allowed by Vista Municipal Code Sections 13. 18. 060.A through F, if the
RWQCB or the Authorized Enforcement Official determines that any of these categories of
otherwise conditionally allowed non- storm water discharges are a source of pollutants to receiving
waters, are a danger to public health or safety, or are causing a public nuisance, such discharges
shall be prohibited from entering the MS4.

A. The City Engineer shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
title. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the City Engineer may be delegated by the
City Engineer to persons in the employ of the City.
B. The City Engineer shall make and enforce regulations necessary to the
administration of this title. He may amend such regulations from time to time as conditions
require. These regulations shall be consistent with the general policy established herein by the
City Council.
C. The City Engineer may grant an exception to any requirements of this title if he

Section 14.01. 050 Sewer Revenue Fund and Reserve Accounts
A. A Sewer Revenue Fund of the City is hereby established. The purposes of the
Sewer Revenue Fund are to provide for the operation, maintenance and replacement costs, and
debt service expense and retirement, if any, of the sewer system. All revenues received from
sewer service charges and other revenues of the sewer system not specifically allocated to
other funds of the sewer system, shall be deposited initially to the Sewer Revenue Fund.
B. The Sewer Revenue Fund shall include an Operating Cash Flow Reserve. The
purpose of the Operating Cash Flow Reserve is to maintain and provide liquidity for operations
14. 01 ( 3) Vista 01/ 14/ 18)
Vista Municipal Code
and maintenance of the sewer system throughout the year. The major portion of revenues for
operating and maintaining the sewer system are received at the end of the first half and midway
through the second half of each fiscal year. For this reason, the City Council intends that the
Operating Cash Flow Reserve be maintained at a funding level of approximately 50 percent of
each annual approved budget for maintenance and operation of the sewer system for each
fiscal year.
C. The Sewer Revenue Fund shall include a Treatment and Discharge Rate
Stabilization Reserve. The purpose of the Treatment and Discharge Rate Stabilization Reserve
is to provide for unexpected treatment and discharge costs imposed upon the sewer system by
the Encina Wastewater Authority (EWA). The City is a member of EWA and all of the
wastewater entering the sewer system is treated and discharged through the EWA treatment
and discharge facilities under permit. The costs of such treatment and discharge are not known
or fixed until after the City' s budget is approved. Therefore, a reserve is needed to meet the
unexpected costs. For this reason, the City Council intends that the Treatment and Discharge
Rate Stabilization Reserve be maintained at a funding level equivalent to 15 percent of the
running average annual cost to the sewer system for treatment and discharge services by EWA
over the preceding five-year period.
D. The Sewer Revenue Fund shall include a Lifeline Allowance Reserve, the
purpose of which is to provide a source of funds for the Lifeline Allowance Rebate Program.
The number of persons and the amount of the Lifeline Allowance Rebates under the program is
uncertain; therefore, the reserve is required to meet the obligations of the program. For this
reason, the City Council intends that the Lifeline Allowance Reserve for the City of Vista shall be
funded, if funded at all, from the City of Vista' s General Fund.

A. The Capital Repairs and Replacement Fund is hereby established. The
purposes of the Capital Repairs and Replacement Fund is to provide for repairs and
replacement of existing capital facilities, equipment, and appurtenances of the sewer system, as
they depreciate, wear out, or breakdown. Such repairs and replacements are essential to
maintaining the sewer system in proper working order and avoiding deterioration of the sewer
system. For this reason, the City Council intends that the Capital Repairs and Replacement
Fund be maintained at a funding level equivalent to the running average of the annual cost of
repairs and replacements required to maintain the sewer system in proper working order for the
preceding five-year period. Transfers to the Capital Repairs and Replacement Fund shall be
authorized from revenues received in the Sewer Revenue Fund, including portions of the sewer
service charges, as directed by the City Council with the approval of the annual budget for the
sewer system. The City Council may transfer such additional funds to the Capital Repairs and
Replacement Fund as it deems prudent or necessary from any available sources in such
amounts as the City Council shall determine.
B. Within the Capital Repairs and Replacement Fund there shall be maintained the
Emergency Capital Replacement Reserve Account. The purpose of the Emergency Capital
Replacement Reserve Account is to provide funding to finance the cost of repairs and
replacements to the existing capital facilities, equipment, and appurtenances of the sewer
system required in any given year in the event of a shortfall or lag in revenues of the system, or
unexpected requirements for repairs or replacements. The City Council intends that the initial
level of this reserve shall be set at $2. 9 million. The City Council may adjust this level from time
to time, as it deems necessary by approval of the annual budget of the sewer system.

ordinance or of any order issued by the City Engineer as authorized by this title, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the City Engineer.
Any person creating such a public nuisance is guilty of a misdemeanor.
B. Injunction. Whenever a discharge of wastewater is in violation of the provisions
of this ordinance, or otherwise causes or threatens to cause a condition of contamination,
pollution, or nuisance, the City Attorney may cause the City to seek a petition to the Superior
Court for the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or
all three, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge.
C. Cost of damage. Any person who violates any provision of this ordinance or who
has a discharge which causes a deposit, obstruction, damage or any other impairment to the

A. A sewer capacity charge is hereby established and imposed upon the owner or
owners of each parcel or property for the privilege of connecting to the public sewerage system
of the City of Vista. The sewer capacity charge shall be based on the number of EDUs
projected to be contributed to the sewer system. The number of EDUs shall be determined in
accordance with this Chapter. The sewer capacity charge shall be paid immediately prior to the
issuance of a sewer discharge permit and related building permit. If the proposed sewer
connection cannot be made, the sewer capacity charge may be refunded when approved by the
City Engineer. Neither the payment of sewer capacity charges or excess EDUs shall be
refunded if the number of EDUs used decreases nor shall EDUs be transferable between
properties. The sewer capacity charge paid by an owner or owners shall remain on City
records.
B. Revenues derived from sewer capacity charge shall be deposited into the Capital
Facilities Fund and used to pay those costs properly chargeable to the fund pursuant to Section

A. The City Council shall establish the amount of the sewer capacity charge
imposed under Section 14. 06.010 by ordinance or resolution. The sewer capacity charge shall
be automatically adjusted on an annual basis beginning on the first day of July of each fiscal
year by the percentage increase, if any, in the March Engineering News Record Los Angeles
Construction Cost Index.
B. The City Manager shall periodically, not less than every three years, but not more
than every five years, review the sewer capacity charges to determine whether the current fees
need to be recalculated based on factors such as new or deleted sewer system facilities,
changes in the costs indices and depreciation, and the number of customers as determined by
14. 06 (l) Vista 01/ 14/ 18)
Vista Municipal Code
the number of equivalent meters. If the City Manager determines that, there has been a
significant change in the factors that are used to calculate the capacity charges, which in turn
requires a revision of the charges, the City Manager shall recommend to the City Council a
revision to the sewer capacity charges.

Section 14.06.040 Capacity Rental Charge
A. In addition to the sewer capacity charge and to the sewer service charge, a
capacity rental charge may be charged to any user whose water use records show that the user
is discharging in excess of purchased sewer capacity. A capacity rental charge will be based on
the number of EDUs of capacity being used in excess of paid sewer capacity charge and are
intended to cover the cost of capital facilities for excess usage.
B. Users with outdoor irrigation meters. For any user who has an outdoor irrigation
meter, the highest bi- monthly water use period on the interior building meter will be converted to
a daily water use and divided by 200 gallons per day. This number will serve as the number of
EDUs used during the fiscal year and will be compared to the purchased sewer capacity in
terms of EDUs to determine if the capacity rental charge will be applied.
C. Users without outdoor irrigation meter. For any user who does not have an
outdoor irrigation water meter, the lowest bi- monthly water use period, excluding zeros, will be
converted to a daily water use and be divided by 200 gallons per day. This number will serve as
the number of EDUs used during the fiscal year and will be compared to the purchased sewer
capacity in terms of EDUs to determine if the capacity rental charge will be applied.

is unfair, incorrect, or improperly charged may file a request for review and adjustment of the
capacity rental charge. All requests for review and adjustment shall be filed in writing and
presented to the City Engineer or designee within 35 days from the date of the initial sewer
service charge notice. Alternatively, a request may be made within 35 days from the date of the
mailing of the property tax bill due in December. The written request shall include all of the
following information:

imposed, including the street address.
2. The name and mailing address of each owner or owners of the property
or premises for which a review and adjustment is requested.

Section 14.06.060 Amount of Capacity Rental Charge and Purchase of Additional
Sewer Capacity
A. The amount of the capacity rental charge shall be established by City Council
with the Sewer Service Charges. This amount will be collected yearly along with the Sewer
Service Charges. The capacity rental charge shall be based on the previous calendar year's
water use as an estimate of sewage generation and shall be calculated each year. Payment of
the capacity rental charge will not change the number of EDUs assigned to a parcel.
B. The property owner may elect to purchase additional sewage capacity to avoid
all or part of the capacity rental charge. Purchase of additional capacity must be made no later
than May 1St of the subsequent year, otherwise capacity rental charges will be placed upon the
property tax roll.
Additional sewer capacity may be purchased in installments according to the
following schedule:
1. From 1. 0 EDUs to 5. 0 EDUs, payment may be in three annual payments.
2. From 5. 01 EDUs to 10. 0 EDUs, payment may be in five annual payments.
3. Over 10.0 EDUs may be purchased in eight annual payments.
If payments are made in installments, the property owner shall sign an
application to purchase sewer capacity in installments, which application shall include
authorization for the City to collect installments on the tax rolls as part of the annual sewer
service charge if not paid along with the annual tax bill. The City Manager or his or her
designee shall be authorized to grant said application. A Notice of Charge on Real Property for
Additional Sewer Capacity and Tax Lien in a form acceptable to the City Attorney shall be
recorded on the property at the Office of the County Clerk. Simple interest shall accrue on the
unpaid balance at a per annum rate to be set upon the date of approval of the application by the
City Manager at a rate equivalent to the yield of a United States Treasury Note for an equivalent
time period. The cost per EDU for additional capacity shall be the amount of the sewage
capacity charge at the time the additional capacity is purchased. An installment shall become
due on May 1 of each year.
Upon payment of the first installment, the property owner shall be given credit for
use of the total amount of sewer capacity purchased in installments for the purpose of
calculating excess usage. However, if the installment payments become delinquent, and a lien
on the property for the delinquent payments does not attach for any reason, credit for the
remaining sewer capacity purchased in installments shall no longer be given to the property
owner, including, but not limited to, bona fide purchasers for value.

capacity rental charge if he finds that the excessive usage was the result of a temporary
condition that has been eliminated or reduced. The property owner must apply for a waiver no
later than May 1 following the calendar year in which the excessive usage occurred. The
application shall include pertinent information such as water bills, repair receipts and a
description of the condition that caused the excessive sewer usage.

15. 04.030 EIR Preparation Thresholds
15. 04.040 City Responsibility for Environmental Assessment
15. 04.050 Expiration of Environmental Determinations
Section 15. 04.010 Purpose
The purpose of these environmental quality regulations (" EQR") is to implement the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CEQA Guidelines (" guidelines") for the City by
applying the provisions and procedures contained in CEQA to development projects proposed
within the city.
Prior Code 31 B- 1; Ord. No. 89- 24, Added 6/ 12/ 89)
Section 15. 04.020 Adoption of State Regulations
As permitted by Section 15022( d) of the California Administrative Code, CEQA
Guidelines, the City adopts the California Environmental Quality Act ( Division 13 of the Public
Resources Code of the State of California, Section 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA
Guidelines, as amended, by reference. Whenever any provisions of the CEQA or the guidelines
conflict with any provision of this chapter, CEQA, and the guidelines shall superseded this
chapter.
Prior Code 31 B- 2; Ord. No. 89- 24, Added 6/ 12/ 89)
Section 15. 04.030 EIR Preparation Thresholds
The City Planner shall determine which projects require the preparation of an
environmental impact report ( EIR), based on the magnitude or complexity of a project. Unless it
can be demonstrated through extensive technical studies that no significant impacts are
anticipated, the following projects are presumed to be sufficiently large and/ or complex so as to
require the preparation of an EIR.
A. Annexations over 200 acres.
B. Commercial or industrial development projects proposing more than 250, 000
square feet of gross building floor area.
C. Other development projects ( i. e., tentative subdivision maps, specific plans,
general plan amendments, etc.) which contain more than 100 acres or propose more than 200
dwelling units.
D. Notwithstanding the above thresholds, projects involving significant controversy
or complexity may require the preparation of an EIR, based on the results of an initial study,
pursuant to Section 15365 of the CEQA Guidelines.
Prior code 31 B- 3; Ord. No. 89- 24, Added 6/ 12/ 89)
Section 15. 04.040 City Responsibility for Environmental Assessment
A. In accordance with the provisions of Section 15084 of the guidelines, the City has
responsibility for, and control over, the form, scope, and contents of all documents comprising

Vista Municipal Code
the environmental assessment of a project. All reports, studies or other documents prepared by
or under the direction of an applicant, intended for inclusion in the environmental documents,
shall be clearly identified as " Proponent' s Environmental Assessment," and shall set forth in
detail the assumptions, and methodologies supporting any conclusions reached, or upon which
any recommendations may be based.
B. The City, at its sole discretion, may decide to utilize the services of a private
consulting firm to prepare or review all studies, reports and other documents required or
permitted by the guidelines, including those submitted by the proponent or any other party. In
all cases, the consultant shall enter into a contract with, and is responsible directly to, the City.
All contract services shall be performed to the satisfaction of the City Planner.
C. All costs incurred in the preparation of the environmental documents, including
the cost of services performed under Subsection ( B) of this section and City staff time, shall be
borne by the proponent.
D. Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 3. 08. 270, the City Manager is
authorized to approve and execute or amend any contract with a consultant for the preparation
of an environmental assessment with a value exceeding $ 25,000 when ( 1) a project applicant
agrees to reimburse the City for expenses incurred by the City in connection with the
preparation of that environmental assessment, and ( 2) the consultant appears on a current list
of persons or companies authorized by the City Council to perform environmental assessments
on the City' s behalf, or is currently providing an environmental assessment for the City under an
ongoing Council approved contract which requires amendment.

Section 15. 08.010 Purpose
Because the disposal of certain items into sanitary landfills contributes unnecessarily to
the premature closure of those landfills, and because many of those items can be used to
replace virgin materials in the manufacture of consumer goods, and because the County of San
Diego requires recyclables to be separated from the waste stream prior to disposal at County
operated landfills, the declared purpose of this ordinance is to require that recyclable materials
be separated from the waste stream prior to disposal.

Section 15. 12.010 Purpose and Intent
In both the built environment and the written historical record, there exists considerable
evidence of the course of human settlement and activity in what now constitutes the City of
Vista: from prehistoric Native American society to Spanish colonization, Mexican rule, American
statehood, the transformation of ranching and dry farming into a diverse agricultural industry,
and the eventual decline of agriculture in the face of suburban residential development.
Acknowledging the role that historic preservation can play in promoting the harmonious, orderly
and efficient development of the City, this chapter establishes a process by which to identify,
protect, enhance, and encourage the viable use of resources that embody the historic,
archaeological, cultural, architectural, and aesthetic heritage of the City, the state and the
nation.
With the fundamental purpose of enacting a practical and sustainable historic
preservation program, this chapter establishes procedures and standards intended to:
A. Carry out the goals and policies of the General Plan.
B. Safeguard the City' s historic heritage as embodied and reflected in its historic
resources and historic areas.
C. Stabilize and improve property values.
D. Preserve the City' s unique visual character.
E. Foster awareness of significant figures, events, and accomplishments in the
City' s history.
F. Strengthen the local economy by promoting tourism and providing an attractive
environment for business and industry.

15. 12 ( 6) Vista 5/ 8/ 13)
Vista Municipal Code
1. If the owner of a designated historic resource demonstrates to the
Planning Commission that such resource cannot be economically used, and denial of a
certificate of appropriateness would deprive the owner of all or most of his or her economic
interest in the property, the Commission may issue the certificate with an effective date 180
days from the date of issuance to allow time for the investigation of alternatives to the proposed
project, such as acquisition of the resource by the City or other entity with the desire and
wherewithal to maintain the historic integrity of the resource.
2. If the applicant has presented clear and convincing evidence to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission that disapproval will work immediate and substantial
hardship on the applicant because of conditions peculiar to the person seeking to carry out the
proposed work, whether this be the property owner, commercial tenant or resident, or because
of conditions peculiar to the particular resource or other feature thereof, and that approval of the
certificate will otherwise be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. In such cases, a
finding of overriding considerations would have to be made through the environmental review
process.

Section 15. 12.110 Historic Preservation Incentives: Historic Property Preservation
Mills Act) Agreements
A. In order to preserve and protect the cultural, historical, and architectural heritage
of the City, certain incentives are provided in this chapter to owners of designated historic
resources. Among these incentives is a property tax reduction through the execution of a
historic property preservation agreement, in accordance with Sections 50280 et seq. of the
Government Code and Sections 439. 2 et seq. of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
B. As mandated by state law, at a minimum, historic property preservation
agreements shall provide for all of the following:
1. A perpetual ten- year term, with a minimum initial term of ten years and
one year added automatically to the term each year unless a notice of nonrenewal is filed. If a
notice of nonrenewal is filed, the agreement will become null and void upon expiration of the
ten- year term in effect at the time the notice was filed.
2. Preservation of the designated historically significant property throughout
the term of the agreement.
3. Restoration and rehabilitation, as necessary, to conform to the rules and
regulations of the Office of Historic Preservation of the State Department of Parks and
Recreation, the United States Secretary of the Interior' s Standards for Rehabilitation and the
State Historical Building Code.
4. Periodic examinations of the interior and exterior of the property by the
assessor, the State Department of Parks and Recreation, and the State Board of Equalization
as may be necessary to determine the property owner's compliance with the terms of the
agreement. Although not mandated by the state, each agreement will also provide for periodic
inspections by City staff with advance notice.
5. Provisions that all successors in interest shall have the same rights and
obligations under the agreement as the owner who entered into the agreement.
6. Right of the City to cancel an agreement if it determines that the property
owner has breached any of the conditions of the agreement or allowed the property to
deteriorate to the point that it no longer meets the criteria for designation as a historic resource.
7. Penalty of 12'/ 2 percent of the full market value ( based upon the
reasonably estimated tax savings for the full term of the agreement, as reasonably determined
by the City) if an agreement is canceled in accordance with Section 15. 12. 140( G).
15. 12 ( 7) Vista 5/ 8/ 13)
Vista Municipal Code
C. An application to enter into a historic property preservation agreement may be
initiated by the owner of a property listed on the City' s Register of Designated Historic
Resources. Submittal requirements are as follows:
1. All forms required by the Planning Division.
2. A scaled site plan showing all existing improvements on the subject
property.
3. An assessment of the current condition of the historic resource, including
recommendations for the rehabilitation of any components of the resource that currently
threaten its preservation or compromise its historic integrity.
4. Official tax valuation information for the most recent tax year.
D. The review procedures for applications for historic property preservation
agreements are as follows:
1. Prior to submitting an application for a historic property preservation
agreement, the property owner shall schedule a pre- application review conference with the City
Planner. The purpose of the pre- application review conference is to ensure that mandatory
terms of the agreement are understood and that the minimum submittal requirements are met.
Applications may be submitted during or after the pre- application review conference.
2. All approved agreements must be executed on or before December 31 of
each year in order to take effect for the following property tax year, or such earlier date as may
be required to satisfy applicable legal requirements or applicable administrative requirements of
those agencies responsible for the notice, levy, collection, and distribution of property taxes.
3. Following receipt of a completed application, the City Planner shall
schedule a meeting with the property owner at the subject property. The meeting will be used to
inspect the property, determine if it complies with applicable criteria, and to develop a list of
improvements, if any, deemed necessary during the first ten- year period of the agreement to
restore the property' s architectural and/ or historical integrity. After the site meeting, a follow- up
meeting may be scheduled by the City Planner with the property owner to estimate the potential
property tax savings for the individual property. However, actual property tax savings will be
calculated by the County Tax Assessor each tax year. The City' s estimate is no more than a
simple estimate and not intended by the City to represent the actual tax savings any person
may experience. No person should rely on City representatives regarding the potential tax
savings resulting from the execution of a Historic Property Preservation Agreement when such
person is contemplating entering into such an agreement. Any person seeking to understand
the tax implications of entering into an agreement should consult a tax professional.
4. Once the site meeting has been completed and a list of required
improvements, if any, has been drafted, the City Planner shall forward the draft agreement and
the proposed list of improvements to the Commission for review. Within 30 days of receiving
said materials, the Commission shall convene a public hearing to consider the proposed list of
improvements, make recommendations for amendments to said list, and recommend approval
or denial of the historic property preservation agreement to the City Council.
5. Within 30 days of receiving said recommendation on the agreement, the
City Council shall convene a public hearing and either approve, conditionally approve, or deny
the requested agreement.
6. Once a historic property preservation agreement has been approved by
the City Council, the property owner shall pay the nonrefundable contract execution fee. Once
said fee has been paid, the approved agreement shall be executed by the property owner(s)
and the City with notarized signatures. The City shall forward all agreements properly executed
during a given calendar year to the County Recorder's office for recordation within 30 days after
the execution date. The recorded copy will be returned to the City for submission to the County
Tax Assessor's office for implementation. In accordance with state law, no properly executed
historic property preservation agreement may take effect until it has been recorded and
15. 12 ( 8) Vista 5/ 8/ 13)
Vista Municipal Code
submitted to the County Tax Assessor's office. Each historic property preservation agreement
recorded before January 20 of a calendar year will take effect for property tax reduction
purposes in the tax year beginning July of that calendar year.
E. The approval of a historic property preservation agreement shall run with the
land, and shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership.
F. Either party to a historic property preservation agreement may file a notice of
nonrenewal at any time after entering into the agreement. The effect of the notice of
nonrenewal is to render the agreement null and void upon expiration of the ten- year term in
effect at the time the notice is filed.
G. As established in this Chapter, the City Council may cancel a historic property
preservation agreement if the City Council determines that the property owner has breached
any of the terms of the agreement or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the extent that it
no longer meets the criteria in Section 15. 12. 060.
1. Following completion of the enforcement of agreement procedures
contained within each historic property preservation agreement and prior to the cancellation of a
historic property preservation agreement, the City Council may initiate and review cancellation
of an agreement.
2. If the City Council cancels an agreement, the property owner shall pay a

Section 15. 12.120 Historic Preservation Incentives: State Historic Building Code;
Parking Reductions and Waivers; Exemption from Certain
Limitations on Nonconforming Structures and Uses
A. The State Historic Building Code provides for reasonable alternatives to
established statutes or regulations where strict compliance would negatively affect the historic
integrity and/ or economic viability of a designated resource. While fulfilling its principal
obligation to protect public health and safety, the City shall apply the State Historic Building
Code in its review of designated historic resources in a manner that supports cost- effective
approaches to the preservation, enhancement, and beneficial use of such resources.
B. Because in many instances historic resources were permitted, constructed and
utilized under less restrictive parking standards than those currently in place, it is often
impossible for these resources to accommodate viable uses without some relief from current
parking requirements. To allow for viable and permitted uses of historic resources that would
otherwise be precluded by current parking standards, this chapter provides for the following:
1. For changes of use in designated historic resources that result in
additional parking requirements ( e. g. from retail to restaurant), the proposed new use shall be
credited with the number of parking spaces required for the outgoing use, regardless of whether
or not this number of spaces is actually provided. Thus, the proposed new use shall be
responsible only for accommodating the net increase in parking spaces required.
2. In circumstances where, as determined by the City Planner, the provision
of required parking under the preceding paragraph cannot be achieved without compromising
the historic integrity of the designated resource, a parking waiver may be granted through a
Minor Use Permit. In waiving parking requirements through a Minor Use Permit, the Planning
Division shall make the following findings, in addition to those findings required for a Minor Use
Permit:
a. The required parking cannot be provided without compromising
the historic integrity of the designated resource.
15. 12 ( 9) Vista 5/ 8/ 13)
Vista Municipal Code
b. As evidenced through an empirical parking study, there are
sufficient on- street parking spaces available to meet the additional demand occasioned by the
change of use.
C. The applicant has entered into a shared parking agreement with
an adjacent property that, as evidenced through an empirical parking study, maintains a surplus
of parking spaces that can be conveniently utilized by the proposed new use during its principal
hours of operation.
d. The applicant pays an in- lieu fee for the required number of
spaces to be provided in a planned public parking facility located within 500 feet of the
designated resource, in which case " planned" shall mean listed in the City' s current capital
improvement plan and slated for construction within the next three years.
C. Historic resources classified as nonconforming buildings or accommodating
nonconforming uses shall benefit from the following provisions:
1. An existing nonconforming setback may be continued to an extent no
greater than double the floor area of the existing encroachment, so long as the additional floor
area extends no further into the required setback area than the existing encroachment.
2. A historic building shall not be classified as nonconforming solely on the
basis of a deficiency or wholesale absence of required on- site parking.
3. A nonconforming building partially or fully destroyed by an act of God or
the public enemy may be restored, and the use and occupancy of said building can be reestablished.

building permit shall be issued for any new development on the property in question for a period
of five years from the date the violation occurs, other than as may be required to comply with
applicable health and safety requirements and regulations, and in no event shall any building
permit authorize any new construction to exceed the building square footage, lot coverage, and
use of the original structure.

A. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the California Surface Mining and
Reclamation Act of 1975, Division 2, Chapter 9, Sections 2710, et seq., of the Public Resources
Code.
B. The Council finds and declares that the extraction of minerals ( including fill
and/ or construction materials) is essential to the continued economic well- being of the City and
to the needs of society, and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or
minimize adverse effects on the environment, to protect the public health, safety and welfare,
and to promote achievement of the goals and objectives of the Vista General Plan.
C. The Council further finds that the reclamation of mined lands as provided in this
chapter will permit the continued mining of minerals and will provide for the protection and
subsequent beneficial use of the mined and reclaimed land.
D. The Council further finds that surface mining takes place in diverse areas where
the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological, and social conditions are significantly different
and that reclamation operations and the specifications therefore may vary accordingly.

code, in reviewing and granting a special use permit or approving a reclamation plan. A special
use permit shall not be granted unless the Planning Commission finds that:
A. The proposed surface mine is consistent with the Vista General Plan and furthers
its implementation;
B. The proposed surface mine will not create a threat to the public health, safety or
welfare either during its operation or upon completion of the operation;
C. Establishment of the surface mine will not adversely affect the environment in
any manner which may not be mitigated satisfactorily;
D. Erosion control practices and facilities are proposed that will minimize soil
erosion from the site and prevent degradation of downstream elements of the watershed;
E. The proposed surface mining operation will not be detrimental to any scenic
corridor or preservation district officially designated as such by local, state or federal agencies;
F. The site is physically suited for a surface mining operation; e. g., adequate routes
of ingress and egress to the site, existing or proposed;
G. The proposed surface mine will not damage any public or private property or
interfere with any existing drainage course in such a manner as to cause damage to any
adjacent
property or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or create an unreasonable
hazard to persons or property;
H. The land area on which the surface mine is proposed is not subject to geological
hazards to the extent that no reasonable amount of corrective work will eliminate or significantly
reduce any potential hazard to persons or property;
I. The proposed surface mining site is to be fenced and/ or maintained in such
manner that no hazards are presented to the public;
J. Finished slopes ( cut or fill) match or blend with the natural contours and
undulations of surrounding land areas;
K. Finish slopes that exceed ten feet in vertical height that are exposed to public
view from or across such open areas as roads, canyons, floodplains or similar public vantage
points or open spaces are adequately screened or landscaped.
L. Where the primary purpose of a surface mining ( borrow pit) operation is to
prepare ( level) a site for future development, the timing of the project in relation to development
in the surrounding area should be a major consideration. When the operation is determined to
be premature, it may be grounds for denying the application for a special use permit under the
provisions of Chapter 18. 74 of this code.

Section 16.08. 100 Department of Building Safety, Building Official, Duties
A. Consistent with Section 103.2 of the California Building Code, a department of
building and safety operates in the City as the Building Division of the Community Development
Department, which is overseen by the person serving as building official pursuant to the City' s
classification schedule, or who discharges those functions. The building official, pursuant to
Section 103.2 of the California Building Code, may appoint or be served by deputies.
B. The responsibilities and duties of the department of building safety and building
official include:
1. All duties assigned pursuant to applicable State law, including the California
Building Code as adopted and amended by the City; and
2. Such additional duties with respect to buildings, structures and the uses
therein which are assigned to the building official by ordinance adopted of the Vista City Council
for the purpose of promoting the public safety.
C. Before the building official issues a certificate of occupancy for a new occupancy
or change in use pursuant to Section 16. 08. 130, the building official shall determine that the
new occupancy or change in use would comply with the California Building Code and constitute
a lawful use under the Title 18 of the Vista Development Code including any specific plan
adopted thereunder. If the building official determines that a new occupancy or change in use
would violate the California Building Code or be unlawful under Title 18 of the Vista
Development Code or any specific plan adopted thereunder, the building official will deny the
application for a certificate of occupancy.
D. By discharging the duties described in Sections 16. 08. 100 through 16. 08. 170,
including paragraph C of this Section, it is intended that the building official will promote: ( i) the
efficient administration of the California Building Code; ( ii) lawful occupancies and uses of
buildings or structures which conform to the California Building Code; and ( iii) compliance with
laws governing the construction maintenance, and use of buildings or structures. In turn, these
efforts assure that the buildings or structures used by the public, including the occupancies and
uses therein, are both safe and lawful. Additionally, such efforts protect the public by deterring
a transformation of lawful buildings, structures, occupancies or uses into building, structures
occupancies, or uses that constitute a nuisance under Title 18 of the Vista Development Code
or Section 8. 36.040( B)( 15) of the Vista Municipal Code.

structure, improvement or portion thereof shall be made until the building official has issued a
certificate of occupancy approving that occupancy or use.
B. For purposes of Chapter 16. 08, the term " new occupancy or change in use"
means any new, changed, modified, or altered occupancy, use or physical characteristic of all
or part of a building or structure which will:
1. Produce an occupancy or use of a formerly vacant portion of a building or
structure in combination with work or activities requiring a permit or authorization under the

Section 16. 08. 170 Requirement to Obtain a Certificate of Occupancy After An
Occupancy or Use is Established
A. The building official may issue a conformance order to achieve or confirm
compliance with the requirements of this Chapter and the California Building Code. The
conformance order will describe the occupancies or uses covered by the order and set a date,
known as the conformance deadline, by which: ( i) a certificate of occupancy shall be obtained
for such occupancies or uses; or ( ii) the initial conformance order shall be rescinded if cause is
shown. If the conformance deadline passes without the issuance of a certificate of occupancy
or a rescission order particular to an occupancy or use, that occupancy or use shall thereafter
be deemed an unlawful use operating without a certificate of occupancy in violation of this
Chapter and subject to all remedies available to the City. A conformance order may be issued
to an owner, operator or manager of a building, structure, business, occupancy or use. Any
conformance order shall describe the basis for the order in writing and shall be delivered by the
United States postal service, in person, or through other means which provides lawful notice. A
conformance deadline shall be set in the reasonable determination of the building official, but
shall not be a date more than 30 days after the date the conformance order issues unless good
cause is shown for an extension to a period not exceeding 90 days from the date the
conformance order was issued.
B. A conformance order may be issued by the building official when:
1. The building official has reason to believe that a new occupancy or
change in use was established in violation of this Chapter without first obtaining a certificate of
occupancy.
2. The building official has reason to believe that a certificate of occupancy
was previously issued for an occupancy or use at a particular location, but the occupancies or
uses existing at the location, as of the date of the conformance order, are operating or existing
in violation of the California Building Code or Title 18 of the Vista Development Code.
3. The building official has reason to believe that an occupancy or use is
operating without a certificate of occupancy, for any reason, in a manner that violates the
California Building Code or Title 18 of the Vista Development Code.
C. If a certificate of occupancy is not obtained by the conformance deadline, the
occupancy or use specified in the order will be classified as an unlawful occupancy or use
existing without a required certificate of occupancy. Each day of continued operation of the
occupancy or use beyond the conformance date will constitute a separate violation of this Code.
16. 08 (6) Vista 11/ 10/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
D. The operation of an occupancy or use without receipt of a conformance order
does not:
1. Indicate that such occupancy or use conforms to any law or regulation of
any nature; or
2. Excuse any legal obligation of an owner, manager, operator or other party
of an occupancy or use to comply with such laws or regulations.

The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302,
65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore,
the City Council of the City of Vista does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
Prior Code Appendix B; Ord. No. 2001- 20, Amended, 10/ 09/ 01; Ord. No. 2007- 2, Amended, 5/ 8/ 07)
Section 16. 48.020 Findings of Fact
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Vista are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
Governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed
or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of
special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

Section 16. 48.030 Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare,
and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally
enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately
owned land within flood prone, mudslide or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are
designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development
of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special
flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
Prior Code Appendix B; Ord. No. 2007- 2, Amended, 5/ 8/ 07)
Section 16. 48.040 Methods of Reducing Flood Losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or
velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplain, stream channels and natural
protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
flood damage;
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas; and
F. These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws,
ordinances and codes.

homes are to be affixed ( including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and the construction of streets) are completed before
the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed ( including the installation of utilities, either final site
grading or pouring of concrete pads, or the construction of streets).

police power which control development in flood- prone areas. The term describes federal, state
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage.
Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or

newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the
community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base
flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while
future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,

the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property
involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more
expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use
than originally intended.

and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and
operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement,
see " Basement" definition).
1. An unfinished or flood- resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is
usable solely for parking vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement
area, is not considered a building' s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non- elevation
design requirements, including, but not limited to:
a. the wet flood proofing standard in Section 16. 48. 150( C) ( 3);
b. the anchoring standards in Section 16. 48. 150(A) ( 1);
C. the construction materials and methods standards in Section
16. 18. 150( B); and

since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on
a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized
by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall he determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as
approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of
external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from
those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may he considered only if such
factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and
supported by a written explanation of the differences.
Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the

permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
of streets and/ or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether

conditions, or
2. Any alteration of a " historic structure" provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure' s continued designation as a " historic structure."
Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other

Section 16. 48. 140 Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be
limited to:
A. Permit review. Review all development permits to determine that:
1. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;
2. All required state and federal permits have been obtained;
3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not
been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Vista; and
5. All Letters of Map Revision ( LOMR's) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based
on Conditional Letters of Map Revisions ( CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of
the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the " start of construction"
definition.
B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.
1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213 " Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering
requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining " Market
Value."
2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and
implemented by community staff.
C. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data.
1. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with Section 16. 48. 070, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency or other
source, in order to administer Sections 16. 48. 150 through 16. 48. 190; or
2. If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency
or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from
the FEMA publication " Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Lone A Areas - A
Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base ( 100- year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order
to administer Sections 16. 48. 150 through 16. 48. 190.
a. Simplified method.
i) 100- year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using
the appropriate regression equation found in a U. S. Geological Survey publication, or the
discharge- drainage area method; and
ii) Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick- 2
computer program developed by FEMA; or
16. 48 ( 10) Vista 4/ 11/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
b. Detailed method.
i) 100- year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using
the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers' HEC- RAS computer program; and
ii) Base flood elevation shall he obtained using the U. S. Army
Corps of Engineers' HEC- HMS computer program.
D. Notification of Other Agencies.
1. Alteration or relocation of a watercourse.
a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
C. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or

2. Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations ( the following
submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting
flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on
current data.):
a. Within 6 months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the
permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision
LOMR).
b. All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building Permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters
of Map Revision ( CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood
control project and land preparation as specified in the " start of construction" definition.
3. Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the
corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a
map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
E. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public
inspection and make available as needed:
1. Certification required in Section 16. 48. 150( C)( 1) ( lowest floor elevations)

Vista Municipal Code
Section 16. 48.210 Conditions for Variances
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general
principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in
nature. A variance may he granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so
unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional
hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must
pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the City of Vista to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so
compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so
serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance
are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only
be met if variances are strictly limited Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this
ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance
can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which
alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
A. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and
other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one- half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one- half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may he issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of
historic structures" as defined in Section 16. 48. 050 upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not, preclude the structure' s continued designation as a historic
structure and the valiance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any
increase in flood levels during, the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering die flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means
to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example,
in the case of a variance to any elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not
grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will provide relief and
preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances
cause fraud on or victimization of, the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Variances may he issued for new construction, substantial improvements and for
other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use

recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure
proposed to be constructed in the area where such soils problems exists.
D. The advisory agency may approve the subdivision or portion thereof where such
soils problem exists if it determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural
damage to each structure to be constructed and a condition to the issuance of any building
permit may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction
of each structure.
Prior Code 28- 3. 1. 4)
Section 17. 12. 070 Planning Commission Duties
The Planning Commission is authorized and directed to carry out the following actions:
17. 12 ( 2) Vista 4/ 12/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
A. Give notice of any public hearing held pursuant to this chapter in the same
manner as required by Subsections A, C and D of Section 18. 04.060. However, in no case,
except for appeals, shall a public hearing be held where the question to be decided is a request
for an extension of time for filing a final map, or a modification to a previously approved
resolution of conditional approval not affecting any design or improvement. In addition, no
separate hearing need be held for any map if the map is part of a project for which a public
hearing is required and said hearing requires notification equivalent to that required by this
section. Notification shall also be made to each tenant in an apartment complex or mobile home
park for which a condominium conversion is requested.
B. Investigate each tentative map filed with it pursuant to this chapter and the
Subdivision Map Act, and the improvements proposed to be constructed or installed, to serve
the subdivision; and make its report with respect to the design and improvements of the
subdivision, including, but not limited to, the type, nature and extent of the proposed
improvements.
C. Within ten days after the filing of a tentative map, the Secretary of the Planning
Commission shall send notice of such ( including information about the location, number of
dwelling units, density and any other pertinent information) to the governing board of any school
district(s) within which the proposed subdivision is located. The governing board( s) must reply to
such notice ( in writing) within 20 working days of the posting date of such notice, indicating the
impact(s) of the proposed subdivision on their jurisdiction( s). Should no reply be received within
the specified time, it shall be assumed the subdivision will have no impact on their facilities, and
they have given it their approval.
D. Obtain the recommendations of:
1. The City Engineer, Director of Health Services of the County of San
Diego, Director of Sanitation and Flood Control of the County of San Diego, Director of
Planning, the City Parks and Recreation Commission, the Vista Irrigation District and the San
Diego Gas and Electric Company, or their authorized representatives, with respect to the design
of the proposed subdivision and the type, nature and extent of the proposed improvements;
2. The Chief of the City Fire Department, with respect to appropriate fire
flow, fire hydrants and connections to be installed; and
3. Such other agencies as may be required by the Planning Commission or
the Secretary thereof.
E. Within 30 days of the filing of a tentative map, and after a duly noticed public
hearing, the Planning Commission shall, by resolution, approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove the tentative map. The action of the Planning Commission shall be reported to the
City Council and the applicant, and shall be final unless appealed pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 17. 12. 110 or 17. 12. 120. The report of the Planning Commission shall include findings
and action on the findings as required by the Subdivision Map Act.
F. A copy of the action on any tentative map submitted to the Planning Commission
shall be submitted to the subdivider; and in the case of a mobile home park conversion or
apartment conversion, to each tenant thereof, a minimum of three business days prior to the
consideration by the Planning Commission. Submittals shall be accomplished by mailing a copy
of said recommendations by first class mail.
G. If the Planning Commission approves or conditionally approves a tentative map,
it shall prescribe, pursuant to the provisions of this title, the type, nature and extent of the
improvements to be constructed or installed to serve the subdivision for which such tentative
map is filed. However, if the Planning Commission does not prescribe the type, nature or extent
of the improvements to be constructed or installed, improvements shall be constructed and
installed in accordance with City specifications.
H. When considering any subdivision map which converts mobile home parks to
other uses or which converts apartments to condominiums, the Planning Commission shall
17. 12 ( 3) Vista 4/ 12/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
consider the report required by Section 17. 12. 020, and shall ensure that each tenant is given
ample opportunity to testify in regards to apartment or mobile home conversions. As a minimum,
the Planning Commission shall impose conditions to mitigate any adverse impact of the
conversion on the ability of the displaced mobile home park residents or apartment residents to
find an adequate place in another mobile home park or apartment, if applicable. In considering
such mitigating measures for apartment conversion, the standards of the condominium housing
ordinance shall apply. In considering mitigating measures with regard to the mobile home park
conversion, the Planning Commission shall, in addition to applying any applicable standards,
minimize impact as much as possible for such residents.

Section 17. 12. 080 Findings Regarding Tentative Map
A. The City Council shall find that the proposed subdivision, together with the
provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with any General Plan required by
Article 5 of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, or with any specific plan
adopted pursuant to Article 8 of said chapter, division and title, or it shall disapprove the
tentative map.
B. The City Council shall disapprove the tentative map for failure to meet or perform
any of the requirements or conditions imposed by the Subdivision Map Act or City ordinances
enacted pursuant thereto, and such disapproval shall be accompanied by a finding identifying
the requirements or conditions which have not been met or performed, provided that it may
waive any failure of the map to meet such requirements and conditions if such failure is a result
of a technical and inadvertent error, which in the determination of the City Council, does not
materially affect the validity of the map.
C. The City Council shall not approve the tentative map if it makes any of the
following findings:
1. That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and
specific plans;
2. That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with the applicable general and specific plans;
3. That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development;
4. That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
development;

likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or
wildlife or their habitat;
6. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to
cause serious public health problems;
7. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict
with easements of record or easements established by court judgment, acquired by the public at
large, for access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection,
the City Council may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use,
will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by
the public;
8. That all requirements of CEQA have not been met;
9. Each of the tenants of a proposed condominium community, apartment,
or stock cooperative project have not received written notification of intention to convert at least
60 days prior to filing of the tentative map; further the Council shall find that each such tenant
and each person applying for a rental unit of such residential property has received all
applicable notices and rights hereafter required by this title and the Subdivision Map Act
17. 12 ( 4) Vista 4/ 12/ 11)

applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map. Findings shall be made that each tenant
will receive ten days written notification that an application for a public report will be submitted to
the department of real estate and that report will be made available upon request to the tenant
at the time of such notification. The Director of Planning shall receive proof of such notification
in the form of a signed receipt from each tenant or proof of service by mail.

shape or is subject to such title limitations of record or is affected by such topographical location
or conditions, or is to be devoted to such usage, that it is impossible or impractical in the
particular case for the subdivider to conform fully to the requirements of this title, the City
Council may waive or modify such requirements as it deems reasonably necessary; provided,
however, any such waiver or modification shall be in conformity with the spirit and purpose of
the Subdivision Map Act and of this title. The City Council may waive or modify such

extension shall be for a period of not more than two years unless the City Planner finds that an
extension for a longer period is warranted, giving consideration to the scope of the project, the
previous expenditures made by the subdivider in furtherance of the subdivision, and the effect of
the extension of the development on the community. The total period of all extensions shall not
exceed five years.
If a subdivider is authorized to file multiple final maps pursuant to section 17. 68.030 and

Prior Code 28- 4. 9. 1)
Section 17. 36.060 Supplemental Improvements - Hearings - Reimbursement Charges
and Agreements
A. The City Council shall hold a public hearing to establish the charge, area of
benefit or local benefit district, which shall only be established if the City Council finds that the
reimbursement charge and the area of benefit or local benefit district are reasonably related to
the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof. The
City Engineer shall report on the reasonableness of the cost of the improvement, and the
Council may reduce the charge to the extent that the Council finds the costs to be
unreasonable. The Council shall adopt a resolution formalizing its findings and containing legal
descriptions of each property, the charge to be imposed on each property, and the identity of
the property owner. If a charge is approved, a certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded
with the County Recorder and the City Engineer shall enter into the appropriate reimbursement
agreement with the developer.
B. In addition to the notice required by Section 66451. 3 of the Government Code,
written notice of the hearing shall be given to the subdivider and to owners of property within the
proposed area of benefit and to the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as
they can be ascertained at the time as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll. Such
notices shall be mailed by the City Clerk at least 30 days prior to the date established for
hearing.
C. In the event owners of parcels subject to a majority of the charge object to the
charge, the Council may only approve the charge by the affirmative vote of at least four of its
members.
D. In the event the subdivider constructs the improvements before the Council
hearing, the City shall not be obligated to reimburse the subdivider out of City funds should the
Council not establish the charge, area of benefit or local benefit district, and all risk of such
failure to levy the charge shall be the subdivider's.
E. In the event the subdivider requests City Council action prior to the construction
of such improvements, the City Engineer may, upon final approval and signing of improvement
drawings, determine the amount of reimbursement based on the submitted engineer's cost
estimate. The City Council' s action pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall be a
declaration of its intention based on such estimates. The Council shall hold a second hearing,
with appropriate notice, findings and resolution, to actually establish the charges and areas
based upon as- built costs after completion and acceptance of the improvements.

or tentative parcel map, or applies for a building permit on a lot for which a charge for said
supplemental improvements has been established in accordance with the provisions of Sections
17. 36. 050 through 17. 36.070, and such person or his predecessor in interest has not paid such
charges to the City, the charge established thereunder shall be paid prior to the filing of the final

payment shall not be required in connection with building permits having a total improvement
value of $ 3, 000 or less; and, provided further that the money paid shall include the principal
charge plus interest. The rate of interest shall be equal to the yield on the 20- year United States
Treasury Note on the date of the adoption of the above referenced resolution per the " h. 15"
report as published by the Federal Reserve. This interest rate shall be fixed and applied for the
entire life of the agreement, compounded annually, and prorated for any partial year. Upon the
payment of such charge, the City Clerk shall record with the County Recorder a notice
satisfactory to the City Attorney that such charge has been paid on such parcel.

The fees levied by this chapter shall be paid to the City in the enumerated amount, to
defray the pro rata costs of the impact of the physical development against which the fee is
assessed.
A. Commercial, industrial, nonresidential governmental, church, public, nonprofit,
institutional, and all other categories of nonresidential construction and residential construction
shall be required to pay the fee based on the area ( acreage) of land to be developed. Where
only a portion of a legal parcel is to be developed, and further development of such parcel is
reasonable, the fee to be charged shall be based on the area to be developed.
B. For every acre of land, or portion thereof, which is developed subsequent to the
adoption of this section, the fee set by resolution will be charged for drainage facilities in the
following PLDF areas:
1. Agua Hedionda Basin

9. North Santa Fe Basin
10. Sunset Basin
Such fees, as set forth by resolution, represent a revision of the fees specified in
Ordinance No. 83-36. Said revisions, which apply to residential and nonresidential
development, reflect the increased cost of constructing such facilities and the addition of
subsequent drainage areas in accordance with the master drainage plan.
C. Pursuant to Section 66483 of the Government Code, such fees are fairly
apportioned within drainage areas on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for
development or on the need for such facilities created by the proposed development of other
property within such areas. Such fees do not provide for the full cost recovery of providing the
required drainage facilities as enumerated in the master drainage plan.
D. Such drainage fees shall be collected and deposited into the appropriate account
of the development trust fund of the City.
E. For the purpose of computing the fee set forth by resolution, acreage shall be
computed as gross acreage to the center line of streets abutting the property in question and
fees for fractional acreage shall be prorated.

solid, competent soil or bedrock beneath the toe of the proposed fill slope.
2. Where fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of fill shall
be not less than ten feet in width and the cut must be made prior to placement of the fill. Such
shall be accepted by the soil engineer and/ or engineering geologist as suitable foundation for
fill.
H. Permitted Materials. Only material free from tree stumps, detrimental amounts of
organic matter, trash, garbage, sod, peat and similar matter shall be permitted. Rocks larger
than six inches in greatest dimension shall not be used unless the method of placement is
properly devised, continuously inspected and supervised by the City Engineer. In addition, the
following shall also apply:
1. Rocks sized greater than six inches in greatest dimension shall be ten
feet or more below grade, measured vertically, or as recommended by the permittee or
engineering geologist.
2. Rocks shall be placed so as to assure filling of all voids with fine.
3. Topsoil shall be used in the top 12 inch surface layer outside proposed
building footprints or paved areas to aid in planting and landscaping.

I. Compaction. All fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of maximum
density, as determined by the latest adopted ASTM standard test method for laboratory
compaction characteristics of soil using modified effort, and must be submitted for any fill 12
inches or more in depth, where such fill may support the foundation for a structure. A higher
relative dry density or additional compaction test, or both, may be required at any time by the
City Engineer.
J. Vegetative Protection. All earth fill slopes shall be planted or otherwise protected
from storm runoff erosion within 30 days of the completion of final erosion control and grading
work. Planting shall be irrigated to establish a root system before the rainy season, if
determined necessary by the City Engineer.

A. General. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soils engineering or
engineering geology report, or both, and shown on the approved grading plan, setbacks shall
conform to this section and be no less than three feet.
B. Minimum Property Setback. The tops and toes of cut and filled slopes shall be
set back from property boundaries and structures as far as necessary for safety of the adjacent
properties and to prevent damage resulting from water runoff by flooding, erosion or sediment
deposition.
C. Stream and Riparian Setback. In areas designated as open space, topsoil, and
toes of cut or fill slopes shall be set back far enough to prevent encroachment of open streams
or floodways or channels or permanent bodies of water to provide and maintain an undisturbed
protective strip between the grading and the stream or riparian corridor.
D. Retaining Walls. Retaining walls when keyed into stable foundations and
capable of sustaining the design loads may be used to reduce the required cut and fill setbacks,
when recommended by the civil engineer or permittee or engineering geologist and approved by
the City Engineer and applicant.
E. Other Restrictions or Minimums. Other requirements may also be increased or
relaxed upon review by the City Engineer, if he finds the deviations consistent with safety and
stability and to provide access for slope maintenance and drainage.

Section 17. 56.310 Design Standards - Drainage and Terraces
A. General. Drainage facilities shall conform to the provisions of this section unless
otherwise indicated on the approved permit and plans. To the greatest extent possible, peak
storm drainage runoff and sediment rates may not exceed predevelopment rates. If rates are
substantially greater than predevelopment rates, a prorated share of the cost of off-site erosion,
sediment and flood control improvements to the principal drainage way may be required to
handle the runoff or peak discharges.
B. Runoff Calculations. The approved plans shall show by table or calculations, or
both, the peak rate of storm runoff both before and after development. To reduce runoff and
sediment, a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff may be
required.
C. Drainage Facilities.
1. Disturbance of drainage ways shall comply with all applicable state and
17. 56 (29) Vista 11/ 24/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
federal laws and regulations and shall be kept to a minimum. Existing drainage courses shall
not be obstructed or obliterated without installing mitigating measures that have been approved
by the City Engineer and all other jurisdictional agencies.
2. Grading equipment shall not disturb or cross flowing streams, unless
absolutely necessary, and only with prior approval from the City Engineer.
3. Whenever a grading operation obstructs or impairs the flow of runoff in an
existing drainage course, a culvert, bridge or other suitable drainage facility designed and
acceptable to the City Engineer shall be installed to convey the flow past the point of
impairment. No construction materials or construction by- products shall be discarded in any
drainage way or riparian zone.
4. Drainage facilities shall be culverts, pipe drains, paved, rock or vegetative
channels designed to safely carry existing and potential off-site runoff from a fully developed
area upstream, as well as local on-site surface and subsurface waters, to the nearest adequate
drainage course designated for such purposes by the City Engineer or other appropriate
jurisdiction, or both, as a safe place to discharge such waters. Properly designed energy
dissipaters are required at the point of discharge.
5. Culvert size and industry standard materials shall be used in accordance
with City standard design criteria and as approved by the City Engineer. Minimum diameter
shall be 12 inches.
6. Plan shall show plan and profile of drainage improvements to include, but
not be limited to: invert, slope, length, material, size, type, hydraulic grade line, downstream
capacity, inlet capacity, lining, and special construction notes.
7. Berms, ditches, interceptor drains or swales shall be constructed at the
top of cut-and-filled slopes for protection against water runoff. Interceptor drains above cut
slopes with a minimum drainage area of 14, 500 square feet ( one-third acre) or more shall be
paved with reinforced concrete or an approved equally non- erodible material a minimum of
three inches thick, 12 inches deep and 30 inches wide and shall discharge into down- drains.
Energy dissipater may be required by the City Engineer.
8. At least a two percent or greater grade shall be provided toward approved
storm facilities, either existing or planned, from all building pads, yards, roof drains, driveways
and similar construction. Earthen lot drainage swales less than two percent shall maintain a
minimum slope of one percent or greater toward yard drains. Design shall clearly show that
yard drain failure cannot cause ponding more than one foot deep.
9. Where feasible, all runoff in excess of predevelopment levels shall be
retained on- site. Where on- site retention is not feasible, all runoff should be detained with
detention basins or other runoff collection devices and released in a controlled fashion over nonerodible
surfaces, so that the runoff rate does not exceed the predevelopment level.
10. Where concentrated runoff will occur, it shall be carried in pipe or culvert
conduits or over a non- erodible surface ( paved, rocked or vegetated), with discharge points
clearly shown on the development plans. Where runoff will be discharged to natural ground or
channels, appropriate energy dissipaters shall be installed to prevent erosion at the point of
discharge.

by a civil engineer and approved by the City Engineer. Suitable access shall be provided to
permit proper grading and maintenance of these terraces. Where only one terrace is required, it
shall be at mid- height.
Exceptions: Variations from the provisions of this subsection may be granted in
the same manner and in accordance with the provisions for the granting of exemptions outlined
in Subsections B and D of Section 17. 56.280.
B. Swales or interceptor pipes or drains, ditches on terraces and on the top of cut
slopes shall be designed to carry water and sediment to safe disposal structures and areas;
shall have a minimum gradient of two percent; must be paved with reinforced concrete or an
approved equally erosion- resistant material not less than three inches in thickness; and shall not
be less than one foot in depth and five feet in width. A maintenance plan shall be required by
the City Engineer.
C. A single run of swale or ditch shall not collect runoff from a tributary area
exceeding 14, 500 square feet (one-third acre, projected) without discharging into a down- drain.

Section 17. 56.330 Design Standards - Runoff, Erosion and Sediment Control
A. Project Design.
1. Design the project to fit the site and to minimize grading. Structures on
slopes exceeding 25 percent that would normally require major grading may be required to
utilize pole, step or other foundations that do not require major excavations or fill.
2. For many projects, access roads and driveways should not cross slopes
greater than 25 percent or require cuts and fills greater than ten feet in height, if alternates are
available.
3. Access and building envelopes or non- buildable areas shall be delineated
on the development plans, so as to keep disturbances out of particularly erodible areas.
4. The faces of cut and fill slopes and the project site shall be prepared and
maintained to control against erosion. Where cut slopes are not subject to erosion due to the
erosion- resistant character of the materials, such protection may be omitted, upon the
recommendation of a permittee or engineering geologist and/ or with the approval of the City
Engineer.
5. Exposed soils and slopes shall be protected to the MEP standard from
erosion by temporary and permanent BMP measures consistent with the Stormwater Standards
Manual. Soil sterilants that last longer than four weeks shall not be used on soils or slopes
which may subsequently need vegetation for erosion and sediment control. As soon as feasible
following completion of each stage of grading and/ or construction, all sites shall be permanently
stabilized by installing all required erosion and sediment control practices to ensure protection
before the normal beginning of the rainy season. Thus, all erosion control measures specified
in this chapter and in the approved erosion control plan shall be in place and maintained at all
times.
6. All streams, floodways, channels, bodies of standing water or other
riparian areas shall be identified and delineated on the development plans, and vegetative
removal, land disturbance activities or other development activities, shall be conducted at a time
and in a manner that will provide and maintain an undisturbed vegetative filter strip. If it is
determined that certain development activities in or near riparian zones would be detrimental,
those activities may be prohibited.
7. Potential Critical Course Sediment Yield Areas shall be evaluated and
delineated prior to commencement of grading activities.
8. The grading and erosion and sediment control plans shall set forth a
17. 56 ( 31) Vista 11/ 24/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
schedule for the construction and ongoing maintenance of any required erosion and sediment
control structures.
B. Erosion and Sediment Control.
1. The erosion and sediment control plan shall be prepared and require
predictions of pre- and post-construction surface runoff and sediment yield, and shall contain
measures that are adequate to control runoff to the MEP. All projects are required to comply
with the Stormwater Standards Manual.
2. Sediment shall be retained on- site. Runoff from disturbed areas, as well
as from buildings, driveways and the total site area, shall be detained or filtered by berms,
swales, ditches, vegetated filter strips, catch basins or other means, as necessary to prevent the
escape of sediment from the site. Sediment control devices ( e. g., debris basins, desilting
basins or silt traps) shall be installed prior to, or concurrent with, initial grading operations and
shall be maintained throughout the development process.
3. No earth or organic material shall be deposited or placed where it may be
directly carried into a stream, marsh slough, lagoon or body of standing water.
4. Maintenance and repair of required sediment or siltation basins, or other
permanent BMPs, shall be provided for by the developer. A special bond to ensure adequate
maintenance and repair, in an amount to be determined by the City Engineer, may be required.
The developer must also submit proof of the mechanism under which ongoing long-term
maintenance of all structural BMPs will be conducted.
C. Land Clearing/ Revegetation.
1. Development plans shall indicate the areas where vegetation is to be
removed and replaced within the building and access envelopes. Vegetation removal shall be
limited to that amount necessary for building, access and construction, as shown on the
approved erosion and sediment control plan.
2. No land clearing shall take place prior to approval of the erosion and
sediment control plan. Vegetation removal between October 1st and April 30th shall not
precede subsequent grading or construction activities by more than 15 days.
3. All bare slopes and disturbed areas shall be planted to both temporary
and permanent vegetation as each stage of grading is completed. Temporary, rapid growing
vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil shall be planted on all disturbed areas, and/ or such
areas shall be mulched, while the permanent vegetative cover matures enough to provide
permanent stability.
4. Temporary planting for erosion protection shall be installed at all times
during the rainy season. Such protection shall be maintained for at least one rainy season until
permanent protection is established. The permanent planting shall be well established prior to
release of the performance bond.
5. All disturbed surfaces shall be prepared and maintained to establish
native or naturalized permanent vegetative growth compatible with the soils of the area.
Permanent planting and irrigation shall be performed in accordance with the specifications
contained in the landscaping ordinance. Mulching, fertilizing and an irrigation system shall be
utilized to establish the new permanent vegetation. To promote the regrowth of vegetation, the
topsoil shall be stockpiled and reapplied upon completion of grading on slopes of less than 25
percent, unless waived by the City Engineer. Soil stockpiles and exposed soil shall be
protected against erosion at all times.
6. All cut and fill slopes shall be protected with straw matting or equivalent
as approved by the City Engineer until permanent landscaping coverage has been achieved.
7. Hydroseeding slopes shall only be allowed if slopes are to remain without
permanent landscaping for 12 months or more and a temporary irrigation system is constructed
and implemented.
17. 56 ( 32) Vista 11/ 24/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
D. Rainy Season Operations ( October Ist - April 30th). No grading operations shall
be allowed during the rainy season from October 1st through April 30th, unless the contractor
has an approved Stormwater Quality Management Plan with erosion and sediment control plans
which have been approved by the City Engineer, all approved erosion and sediment control
practices and devices have been installed before the onset of the rainy season to protect
against either on- site, adjacent property or downstream erosion and sediment damage, and the
required security has been posted with the City Engineer.
1. During the rainy season, disturbed surfaces not involved in immediate
operations shall be protected by mulching and/ or other effective means of soil protection.
Existing ground cover shall not be cleared more than 15 days prior to actual grading or
construction work.
2. All temporary erosion control measures shall be in place at the end of
each working day. Sufficient erosion control materials ( e. g., mulch, plastic sheeting, gravel
bags, biologs, or other BMPs) shall be kept on- site at all times, to be installed immediately by
the Permittee upon impending rainfall that might be expected to cause accelerated erosion. For
the purpose of this section, " impending rainfall' shall mean a 30 percent chance of precipitation
as predicted by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA). Emergency workers
shall be made available at all times during the rainy season to implement BMPs as necessary.
If precipitation is predicted for a weekend day or holiday, all BMPs must be in place and
implemented prior to the end of the last working day prior to the weekend or non-working
holiday.
3. All erosion and sediment control measures shall be closely inspected and
monitored during the rainy season, and problems shall be corrected promptly. The City
Engineer shall employ the stop work order and cash bond provisions of this chapter to perform
corrective work, if necessary.
4. After each rainstorm, all silt and debris shall be removed from check
berms and desilting basins and the basins pumped dry.
a. After each rainstorm, the performance of the erosion control
system shall be evaluated and revised and repaired as necessary.
5. Land disturbance activity or development operations may be restricted or
temporarily halted during the rainy season and/ or other times whenever the City Engineer
determines that the weather, soil, slope and general site conditions may cause serious
accelerated erosion or sediment damage either on- site or downstream.
E. Dust Control. All graded surfaces and materials, whether filled, excavated,
transported or stockpiled, shall be wetted, protected or contained in such a manner as to reduce
or minimize nuisance from dust or spillage upon adjoining property or streets. Equipment and
materials on the site shall be used in such a manner as to avoid excessive dust.
F. Erosion Control Coordination with Project Installation.
1. All vegetative and/ or structural measures, or both, required to retain
sediment on- site and to safely discharge any accelerated runoff generated by the project, shall
be installed during the first or initial construction phase of the project.
2. Land shall be developed in units of workable size which can be
completed in a single construction season. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be
coordinated with a sequence of grading, construction and development operations and all
necessary erosion control measures shall be put in effect prior to the next commencement of
the next work unit or rainy season.
G. Maintenance of Protective Devices. The owner of any property on which grading
has been performed pursuant to a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, or any
other person or agent in control of such property, shall maintain in good condition and repair, all
drainage structures, erosion and sediment control devices, vegetation, irrigation systems and
other protective devices shown on the erosion control plans filed with the application for grading

Section 17.56.390 Violation - Penalty
A. Any grading commenced or done contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or
other violation of this chapter, shall be, and the same is declared to be, a public nuisance. Upon
order of the City Council, the City Attorney shall commence necessary proceedings for the
abatement of any such public nuisance, in the manner provided by law. Any failure, refusal or
neglect to obtain a permit as required by this chapter shall be prima facie evidence of the fact
that a public nuisance has been committed in connection with any grading commenced or done
contrary to the provisions of this chapter.
B. In the event that grading is commenced without a permit, the City Engineer shall
cause such work to be stopped until a permit is obtained. The permit fee, in such instance, shall
then be double that which would normally be required. The payment of such double fee shall
not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this chapter and the

Section 17. 60.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish certain fees on development projects to
compensate for the impacts which these developments may impose on the City. The fees
established by this chapter are consistent with the requirements of Section 66000 et seq. of the
State Government Code, which requires a " reasonable relationship" between the development
fee and the need for the public facility for which the fee is imposed. The basis of the
development fee is identified in the "Community Facilities Element" of the City General Plan.
Prior Code 31 A- 16)
Section 17. 60.020 Findings
The City Council finds that:
A. The City' s Community Facilities Element, adopted on February 27, 1989,
provides a framework for a growth management strategy, which addresses the extension and
provision of public facilities and services. This chapter is consistent with the Community
Facilities Element of the General Plan.
B. The passage of State Propositions 13 and 4 placed restrictions on public
agencies' revenue raising capabilities.
C. The City' s concern with growth management strategies has focused on two
primary objectives:
1. To secure the necessary funds to provide for new development capital
needs without adding to the burden of existing residents; and
2. To influence the timing of new development and to direct and coordinate
that development to locations within the City that avoid or minimize any adverse environmental,
fiscal, or social impacts to existing or future residents.
D. The methodology established in the " Community Facilities Needs Assessment"
Exhibit A, on file in the Office of the City Clerk) provides a reasonable relationship, as required
by Section 66000 et seq., of the Government Code, between the need for public facilities and
the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.
E. Exhibit B ( on file in the Office of the City Clerk) presents a fee schedule which
represents full cost recovery, in current dollars, of the City' s costs in providing public facilities,
based on the methodology presented in the Community Facilities Needs Assessment.
17. 60 ( l) Vista 9/ 23/ 16)
Vista Municipal Code
F. Section 17. 60. 050 presents the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the City
Council, representing development fees which are less than those presented in Exhibit B ( on file
in the Office of the City Clerk).
G. The rationale behind adopting the lower fee schedule ( Section 17. 60.050) is as
follows:
1. The City specifically needs to attract and maintain a strong economic
base, and needs to remain competitive with neighboring cities with regard to attracting quality
development; and
2. Other opportunities exist to provide revenue to supplement general
development fee revenue. These opportunities include sales tax generated by commercial
projects, County Proposition " A" ( sales tax based), federal and state grants ( such as FAU
programs), assessment districts, Mello- Roos Districts, and tax increment financing.
Prior Code 31 A- 17)
Section 17. 60.030 Disposition/Allocation of Funds
The sums derived from the collection of the development fees adopted by this chapter
shall be held in trust by the Treasurer of the City and shall be distributed according to the fiscal
and budgetary provisions of the City subject to the following conditions and limitations. The
proceeds from the development fees, including earnings from investments thereof, shall be
used only for the payment of expenses related to the construction of public facilities and
appurtenances as described in the Community Facilities Needs Assessment, Exhibit A to
Ordinance No. 89- 6 ( on file in the Office of the City Clerk). Such expenses shall include the
payment or repayment of design, construction and/ or administrative expenses related thereto.

commences operation without engaging in work or undertaking activities for which a permit or
similar authorization is required under the Vista Development Code, California Building Code,
or similar code.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "new occupancy or change in use" means
any new, changed, modified, or altered occupancy or use of all or part of a building, structure
or parcel which will:

C. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or occupant whose action will or has
necessitated issuance of a certificate of occupancy to apply for and obtain such certificate
before establishing or operating a new occupancy or change in use. It shall be unlawful to
establish a new occupancy or change in use without first obtaining a certificate of occupancy,
and thereafter maintaining the certificate of occupancy in good standing during all periods that
such occupancy or use occurs.
D. The City Planner or the City Planner' s designee ( hereinafter the "permitting
official") will process applications for certificates of occupancy using an approved form upon
payment of an application fee in such amount as may be set by resolution of the City Council or
as may be otherwise allowed by law.
E. Before the permitting official issues a certificate of occupancy for a new
occupancy or change in use pursuant to this Section, the permitting official shall determine that
the new occupancy or changed in use would constitute a lawful use under Title 18 of the Vista
Development Code and specific plans adopted thereunder. If the permitting official determines
that a new occupancy or change in use would violate Title 18 of the Vista Development Code or
specific plans adopted thereunder, the permitting official will deny issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for that new occupancy or change in use. When issued, the certificate of occupancy
shall, at minimum, include the following information:
1. The address of the location covered by certificate of occupancy;
2. The name and address of the permit holder;
3. A description of that areas covered by the certificate;

6. Any limitations or conditions that apply to the approved occupancy or use.
F. If the permitting official finds that a location subject to an application for a
certificate of occupancy can be occupied safely, and that no substantial hazard will result from
such occupancy before all work is completed, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued. A certificate of occupancy is required upon completion of the remainder of the work.
The permitting official shall set a time period during which the temporary certificate of
occupancy is valid.
G. To streamline the application and issuance of certificates of occupancy pursuant
to this Section which involve buildings or structures in whole or part, the City Planner may elect

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone shown upon the zoning map
or any part or unit thereof, the following rules of construction shall apply:
A. Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley
lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
B. In the case of unsubdivided property, and where a zone boundary divides a lot, the
location of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined
by the use of the scale appearing on the zoning map.
C. Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the area
comprising such vacated street or alley shall acquire the classification of the property to which it
reverts.
D. Areas of dedicated streets or alleys and railroad rights-of-way, other than such as
are designated on the zoning map as being classified in one of the zones provided in this title,
shall be deemed to be unclassified and such unclassified streets shall be used only for purposes
lawfully allowed and such unclassified railroad rights- of-way shall be used solely for the purpose

Section 18. 06.070 Unclassified Property
Any property which, for any reason, is not designated on the zoning map as being
classified in any of the zones established hereby, shall be deemed to be classified R- 1.
Prior Code Appendix A 307)
Section 18. 06.080 Prezoning Unincorporated Properties
A. The City Council recognizes the fact that a City' s social and economic life is seldom
limited to the area within its corporate limits; that real need exists to consider zoning and physical
planning on the basis of the existing and developing area rather than only the areas currently
within the City limits; that state law, through the medium of the Conservation and Planning Act
see Government Code, Section 65859), recognizes the existence of the relationship between a
City and the areas adjacent thereto, and has incorporated in such state law a mandate that cities
shall preplan areas contiguous thereto if, in the opinion of the City, such areas bear a relationship
to its planning.
B. In recognition of such policy and purpose and the possibility of annexation of
adjoining lands, the City undertakes to establish an expansion of a consistent land use pattern
that shall prevail, if and when areas contained within such expanded plans annex to the City.
C. For that purpose, precise prezoning maps may be developed and adopted in the
same manner prescribed by this title for the classification of property within the City, including
procedures for and concurrent consideration of conditional use permits and specific plans.
Prior Code Appendix A 308)
Section 18. 06.090 Classification of Annexed or Incorporated Properties
A. If a precise prezoning map has been adopted for the subject area, then such
annexed or incorporated properties contained therein shall be classified as indicated thereon
upon becoming a part of the City. Portions of the precise prezoning map applicable to the subject
properties shall become a part of the City' s zoning map and such properties shall thereafter be
subject to all provisions of the City' s Zoning Code at the time the annexation becomes effective.
B. If a precise prezoning map has not been adopted for an area subject to annexation
or incorporation, then such area shall acquire the zoning classification most nearly compatible
with the land use classification of the general plan, as may be determined by the compatibility
matrix of the general plan, e. g., property subject to annexation which falls within the LD ( lowdensity
residential) land use classification of the general plan may be classified as E- 1, E- 1 ( 1. 5)
or any other more restrictive zoning classification as may be determined to be compatible with
the general plan. Such zoning classification shall become effective at the time the annexation
becomes effective and shall remain in effect until such time that a precise zoning plan has been
adopted for the subject properties in accordance with the provisions hereof.
C. In those instances where a property or properties subject to annexation or
incorporation is not subject to a precise prezoning map and there is no general plan land use
classification applicable to the subject area it shall become subject to the A- 1 ( 5) zoning
18. 06 ( 3) Vista 1/ 10/ 20)
Vista Municipal Code
classification upon the effective date of the annexation. Such zoning classification shall remain
in effect until such time that an appropriate general plan land use classification and zoning
classification has been adopted in accordance with the provisions hereof; however, the City
Council may adopt an interim zoning ordinance in accordance with the provisions of Section
65858 of the Government Code establishing an appropriate zoning classification if it determines
such is necessary to protect the public safety, health and welfare.

Section 18. 06. 100 Land Use Conformity Required
A. Except as provided in this title, no building or structure shall be erected and no
existing building or structure shall be moved, altered, added to or enlarged, nor shall any land,
building, structure or premises be used for any purpose or in any manner other than is permitted
in the zone in which such land, building, structure or premises is located.
B. Under no circumstances will a use or an accessory use be classified as a lawful,
permitted, special, or conditional use under this Code if its maintenance or operation would
constitute, produce, or result in a violation of State or local laws, including those relating to
cannabis.

needed to qualify as a lawful use as defined in Section 18. 02. 372.
B. Only lawful uses may be legally established, operated, or maintained on land or in
a building within the City of Vista.
C. It is unlawful, prohibited, and a violation of this code for a person to manage,

a same or similar unlawful use; or, ( 5) is a key employee or workers ( whether for compensation
or as a volunteer) at or for the unlawful use. For purposes of this paragraph, a key employee or
worker is a person who provides on- site work, efforts or services for the benefit of the unlawful
use ( whether or not hired by the unlawful use as an employee or serving as an unpaid volunteer)
during a period when there are no more than two key employees or workers present at the site of
the unlawful use ( other than security) who are performing work or services for the benefit of the
unlawful use.
E. A person operates or materially contributes to an unlawful use if the person: ( 1) is
an on- site manager of the unlawful use during any period that the unlawful business is open; ( 2)
is hired to provide or otherwise provides security at the unlawful use; or ( 3) is a key employee at
or worker for the unlawful use. For purposes of this paragraph, a key employee or worker is a
18. 06 ( 4) Vista 1/ 10/ 20)

person who provides on- site work or services for the benefit of the unlawful use ( whether or not
hired by the unlawful use as an employee) during a period when there are no more than two
persons present at the site of the unlawful use ( other than security) who are performing work for
the benefit of the unlawful use.
F. Enforcement against an unlawful use, a person who maintains and operates an
unlawful use, or a person who materially contributes to an unlawful use may occur using any or
all available legal means, including without limitation, the issuance of administrative citations, civil
proceedings, nuisance proceedings, or criminal proceedings.
G. This section is declarative of existing law previously established by the Vista
Development Code and other enactments, including without limitation Section 18. 06. 100.

Section 18. 24.060 Density Establishment and Determination
A. At the time of classifying or reclassifying land as being in the PRD zone, the
ordinance affecting same shall designate a whole number suffix to the PRD designation from 1
through 29, i. e. PRD- 2, PRD- 10, PRD- 21, and such suffix shall indicate the number of dwelling
units permitted to be constructed thereon per gross acre of such land so classified or
reclassified pursuant to this chapter. The Planning Commission may recommend and the City
Council may designate a PRD zone with a suffix equal to or less than, with the concurrence of
the applicant, the maximum number allowed by Subsection B of this section, but in no case
shall a PRD zone be recommended or designated with a suffix greater than the maximum
number allowed by subsection B of this section.
B. The maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre of the land proposed to be
so classified or reclassified shall depend on the average natural slope of the land and the
maximum density indicated therefore by the land use element of the General Plan and shall be
determined by the formula:

Section 18. 24.080 Development Standards
The following criteria shall govern the design of a planned residential development:
A. Setbacks and Spacing of Buildings.
1. A setback of at least 50 feet from the street centerline shall be maintained
by all buildings and structures from any street, public or private, except as hereinafter provided,
and except walls and fences along any exterior subdivision boundary of the development;
provided, however, that when such street has a right- of-way width greater than 60 feet, a
setback of 20 feet from the right- of-way of such street shall be maintained. The setback along
any interior or rear property line shall be no less than ten feet.
2. No building, except as hereafter provided, shall be located closer than
five feet from any interior vehicular or pedestrian way, court, plaza, open parking facility or any
other surfaced area reserved for public use or for use in common by residents of the PRD. Such
setback shall be measured from the nearest edge of a surfaced area; provided, however, that
where no sidewalk exists in conjunction with a public or private street, such setback shall be
measured from the nearest edge of the street right- of-way or private road easement.
3. Garages and carports shall be set back as set forth by the terms of the
PRD permit; provided, however, that no such structure shall be located closer than ten feet from
the nearest edge of any public or private street right- of-way or easement line.
4. Spacing between detached buildings and structures shall be at least ten
feet. Groups of dwelling units such as townhouses are permitted to abut one another, provided
the horizontal dimension of any building group shall not exceed 150 continuous feet.
B. Parking Requirements.
1. There shall be provided a two-car, covered and enclosed garage for each
dwelling unit. The assigned garage space shall be located within a walking distance of 100 feet
18. 24 (4) Vista 7/ 12/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
from the dwelling unit served by such garage.
2. In addition to the garage required by subsection ( B) ( 1) of this section,
there shall be provided open parking spaces in the amount of five-tenths for each one- bedroom
dwelling unit, one for each two- bedroom dwelling unit, and one and five-tenths for each threebedroom
and larger dwelling unit.
3. Recreational vehicle parking shall be provided as set forth in Note E of
Section 18. 54.050.
4. The parking requirements set forth in this chapter may be modified by the
terms of the PRD permit if such modification will not result in on- street parking, traffic circulation
conflicts, or a grant or privilege not enjoyed by properties in the same zone having similar
circumstances.
C. Building Site Requirements. For purposes of complying with the provisions of
this section, each dwelling unit shown on the site development plan shall constitute a building
site or lot as defined in the zoning title.
D. Lot Area. No minimum lot area is required.
E. Lot Width and Depth. No minimum lot width and depth are required.
F. Access. Each residential lot or building site in the PRD need not abut a street,
provided the ownership of any residential lot not so abutting shall include a recorded right of
access from a street capable of providing pedestrian, emergency and service vehicle travel.
G. Repealed.
H. Open Space Requirements.
1. At least 40 percent of the gross land area of any PRD shall be maintained
as open space and land occupied by buildings, streets, driveways, parking areas, service areas
or recreational buildings shall not be included in satisfaction of this open space requirement.
2. At least one- half of the required open space shall have an overall finish
slope not to exceed ten percent. If 60 percent or more of the gross land area included in the
application for a PRD permit has an existing average natural slope greater than ten percent, the
overall finish slope requirement set forth in this subdivision may be modified by the terms of the
PRD permit to require only 25 percent of the required open space to not exceed a ten percent
slope, provided the intent and spirit of the zoning title are not violated.
3. Open space shall have such landscaping as is approved by the terms of
the PRD permit. Areas devoted to natural or improved flood control channels and those areas
encumbered by flowage, floodway or drainage easements may be applied in satisfaction of the
total open space requirement.
I. Phased Development. If development is to be accomplished in phases, the
application for the PRD permit shall so indicate by phase lines and a construction schedule.
Such schedule shall coordinate the construction of buildings, structures and improvements in
such open space with the construction of dwelling units in order that each development phase
achieves a proportionate share of the total open space and environmental quality of the total
planned development. The phase lines shall be as shown on the tentative subdivision map to be
filed with the application, and the construction schedule shall require the completion of all
requirements within each phase as shown and such other requirements beyond the phase lines
as are required by each department or agency having authority over any part of the project for
that phase. If the PRD permit expires, all phases not completed shall be deemed to be annexed
to any existing homeowners' association as open space, and such annexation shall be provided
for in the conditions, covenants and restrictions required by Section 18. 24.090.
J. Grading Requirements. A PRD shall have a minimum of grading and earth
movement. If grading is found to be necessary to improve the overall development of the site,
the following special requirements shall be applicable in addition to the other grading
requirements set forth in this code:

only as a means of preserving the natural scenic quality of the surrounding vegetation and
wildlife habitat.
2. Restoration of contours, altered by grading, to create a natural
appearance by means of land sculpturing which conforms with the slope of existing topography
shall be required if necessary for preservation of unique and valuable land forms.
3. Existing major predominate ridgeline profiles shall be retained.
4. In order to control and minimize erosion and maintain visual harmony in
the area, manufactured cut or fill slopes shall be planted with plant materials native or
compatible to the general area. Plant materials shall be used which will minimize fire potential,
protect slopes from soil erosion and slippage, minimize visual effects of grading and
construction, and soften the impact of manufactured edges.
5. The top and toe of any manufactured cut or fill slope and the point at
which any excavation joins existing undisturbed soil shall be rounded.
6. Manufactured slopes shall be contoured in a manner so as to maintain
the natural undulating appearance of the existing topography.
7. The slope for any cut or fill bank resulting from grading shall not be less
than two feet horizontal for each one foot vertical, except as may be approved by the terms of
the PRD permit.
K. Utility Undergrounding Requirement. All new and existing utility distribution
facilities, including cable television lines, within the boundaries of any PRD or within any half
street abutting a PRD shall be placed underground. The owner is responsible for complying with
the requirements of this section, and he shall make the necessary arrangements with each of
the serving utilities, including licensed cable television operators, for the installation of such
facilities. Transformers, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, concealed ducts, and other
facilities necessarily appurtenant to such underground utilities and street lighting systems may
be placed above ground. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the installation and
maintenance of overhead electric transmission lines in excess of 34, 500 volts and long distance
and trunk communication facilities. The installation of cable television lines may be waived when
no licensed cable television operator is found to be willing and able to install cable television
lines in the PRD.
L. Paving Standards. The design and construction of all parking areas, including
access ways thereto, serving multiple- family projects ( three or more dwelling units) and all
commercial or industrial facilities, or any other facility held open for public use, shall be paved.
Such paving standards shall be based upon a Traffic Index ( T. I.) of four and five-tenths and the
applicable "R" value of the soil( s) at the project site as determined by a registered soils
engineer. Specific modification( s) of this standard may be made or approved by the Director of
Public Works where sound engineering practices may justify such modification( s). This standard
shall be applicable to all new projects and existing parking areas subject to resurfacing or repair
of the parking area surface, where the original surface has broken up or is subject to removal
and replacement, for which a building, grading or any other construction permit is issued after
the effective date of the amendment to the ordinance codified in this title.

Section 18. 46.010 Purpose of Provisions
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to encourage harmonious industrial
development in the city. The regulations for this industrial park zone are intended to provide
compatible industrial uses. Because of the predominantly residential nature and the limited
number of potential industrial sites in the city, this chapter is intended to provide for harmonious
industrial development between industrial park land activities and residential development. Any
industrial activity may operate in the IP zone, provided it conforms to the development and
performance standards set forth in this chapter. These standards are intended to ensure that
industrial activities which locate in this industrial park zone are compatible with the surrounding
environment.

Code of the state.
B. The General Plan shall consist of a statement of development policies with maps,
diagrams and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards and plan proposals, and shall
include those elements required by state law and such other elements as are adopted from time
to time. The text, documents and maps shall be endorsed in the manner provided by the City
Council, and the original copies thereof will be filed with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission.
Prior Code Appendix A 1601)
Section 18. 48.020 Amendments
A. The General Plan shall be reviewed periodically as conditions may require, and
amendments shall be made thereto as provided by law. Upon approval, amendments to the
General Plan shall be endorsed in the same manner as the original and filed with the Secretary
of the Planning Commission. Proposed amendments to the zoning ordinance which are not
consistent with the General Plan may not be recommended or adopted until the General Plan is
amended to eliminate such inconsistencies.
B. Such General Plan amendments shall be considered in accordance with the
following procedures:
1. Any hearing for such General Plan amendment and zone changes or
zoning ordinance amendment may be held concurrently by both the Planning Commission and
the City Council; provided, however, that a denial of the General Plan amendment shall
constitute denial of the zoning ordinance amendment if such zoning ordinance amendment
requires the General Plan amendment to conform to the General Plan.
2. No General Plan element required by state law shall be amended more
than four times in any calendar year, exclusive of the adoption of the element; provided,
however, that any element may be amended additional times provided that such additional
amendments shall be found to be necessary to encourage low and moderate income housing
within the city.
3. Amendments to the General Plan may be initiated by the City Council,
Planning Commission, City staff or any person owning property or residing within the sphere of
influence of the City. Each application for such amendment by an owner/resident shall be made
on forms provided by the Director of Planning and shall be covered by a fee as set forth by
resolution of the City Council. The application shall also be accompanied by all required
environmental documents in accordance with the City's environmental quality regulations. Each
application shall be considered by the Planning Commission at a public hearing which shall
18. 48 ( l) Vista 7/ 13/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
make a recommendation to the City Council, as provided by law. The City Council shall hold a
public hearing on the application as provided by law and should the City Council wish to amend
the General Plan, it may do so by adoption of a resolution at any time. Due to the necessity for
reducing the number of General Plan amendments in any one calendar year, separate
applications shall be combined into one application and held on such combined applications and
after required hearings of determination made by the City Council, whenever such combination
is feasible.
Prior Code Appendix A 1602)
Section 18. 48.030 Conformance with General Plan
The General Plan shall be administered as provided by law. The zoning ordinance must
be consistent with the General Plan. " Consistency" means that the various land uses authorized
by the zoning ordinance are compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses and
programs specified in such plan. In no case shall the City approve any amendment to the
zoning ordinance, zone change or special use permit that is inconsistent with the General Plan.
In the event that the zoning ordinance becomes inconsistent with the General Plan by reason of
amendment to such plan, or to an element of such plan, the zoning ordinance shall be amended
within a reasonable time so that it is consistent with the General Plan as amended.
Prior Code Appendix A 1603)
Section 18. 48.040 Interpretation of Plan - Appeals

18. 50.020 Conformance with Plan
18. 50. 030 Variances from Provisions
Section 1830.010 Purpose and Adoption of Provisions
A. Purpose. Wherein the zoning map establishes only zone boundaries, the text of
the ordinance establishes the permitted use of land in the various zones and the conditions
applicable to such use, and the adopted General Plan indicates the general location of future
land uses, a specific plan, as the term is employed in this chapter, has the following purposes:
1. To apply the provisions and requirements of the ordinance and General
Plan in specific detail by means of a map, including possible streets, alleys and other public
dedications, the establishment of which would be accomplished in the manner otherwise
provided by law and to provide for the design and placement of essential related facilities such
as off-street parking, loading and unloading areas, points of ingress and egress, particularly
related to bordering traffic flow; the placement and arrangement of buildings, and other subjects
not included in this chapter but which are essential to public safety and general welfare such as
controlling the pattern and flow of traffic and such other related details as represent modern
specialized land development and use.
2. To provide similar plans for the consolidated use of subdivided property,
the dimensions, shape and size of which do not individually lend themselves advantageously to
any form of modern land utilization.
B. Adoption.
1. Such specific plans shall be adopted in the manner prescribed for
amending the zoning map, and such specific plans, when so adopted, shall constitute
amendments to the zoning map as to zone classifications, where involved, and the details of
such specific plans shall supersede and shall take the place of the requirements and conditions
upon the use of land as established by this chapter, insofar as the property contained in the
specific plans is concerned.
2. A specific plan, when adopted as provided in this chapter, shall be
considered as being a specific plan within the full meaning of the State Conservation and
Planning Law and, because the adoption of such specific plan accomplishes both the
amendment of the zoning map and the establishment of detailed subjects other than zoning
matters, separate but concurrent proceedings shall be employed. The resulting specific plan
shall be separately recorded both as a component of the comprehensive General Plan and as
an amendment to the zoning ordinance.
Prior Code Appendix A 1701)
Section 18. 50.020 Conformance with Plan
In order to assure that the purpose and provisions of a formally adopted specific plan of
record shall be conformed to, the land reclassified within any specific plan of record shall be
limited exclusively to such uses as are first permitted in the zone to which it is classified. Uses
shown on such specific plan, including automobile parking, shall conform to such specific plan,
even though such uses are not otherwise specifically classified by this chapter as permissible in
any given zone.

legal corporate limits of the city, but not on City property. Signs on City property and the public
right- of-way are controlled by Chapter 12.20. This chapter does not regulate signs used in
conjunction with parades, demonstrations and public assemblies; which, instead, are governed
by Chapter 12. 12 ( Permits for Block Parties and Street Events) and Chapter 12. 13 ( Permits for
Park Events.)
C. Obligation to Satisfy Other Legal Requirements. This chapter does not modify
state or federal laws pertaining to the regulation or display of signs. In addition to satisfying the
minimum standards set forth in this chapter, the erection, display, and maintenance of any sign
must also satisfy all applicable requirements imposed by other statutes, laws, ordinances and
regulations, and codes, including without limitation, the building code, plumbing code, grading
code, the electrical code, and storm water regulations.
D. Easements and Covenants. This chapter does not abrogate, override, limit,
modify, or nullify any easements, covenants, leases or other existing private agreements that
are more restrictive than this chapter.
E. Special Events. This chapter does not regulate signs that are displayed as part
of a special event operating under a permit issued pursuant to Chapters 12. 12 ( Permits for
Block Parties and Street Events) or 12. 13 of the Vista Municipal Code ( Permits for Park Events).
F. Prior Study. Prior to the adoption of this ordinance amending Chapter 18. 52, the
City of Vista conducted an inventory of all sign displays within the city that were legal, illegal, or
non- conforming, under the then- existing law, in accordance with Section 5491. 1 of the California
Business and Professions Code. Having considered that study at the public hearing during
which this ordinance was adopted, the City Council has determined that there is a need for the
ordinance to take effect in a manner to apply to all existing signs within the city.

Section 18. 52.040 Neutral Administration
The provisions and policies stated in this section apply to all signs within the regulatory
scope of this chapter, and override any more specific provisions to the contrary contained
anywhere within this chapter.
A. Message neutrality. It is the City' s policy to regulate signs in a constitutional
manner, which is content neutral as to noncommercial signs and at least viewpoint neutral as to
commercial signs.
B. Regulatory interpretations. All regulatory interpretations of this chapter are to be
exercised in light of the City' s message neutrality and substitution of messages policies.
Whenever any sign permit or other authorization is subject to a discretionary review, such
review shall not consider the message content of the sign, other than whether any proposed
commercial messages thereon are off-site or on- site. Where a particular type of sign is
proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this
chapter, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a " structure" as defined in the building code,
then the Community Development Director or his/ her designee shall approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type that is expressly
regulated by this chapter.
C. Substitution of messages. Subject to the land owner' s consent, a noncommercial
message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message
or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided that the sign structure or
mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of
message may be made without any additional approval or permitting, however, it must comply
with existing sign regulations or applicable code sections. This provision prevails over any more
specific provision to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent
any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any
particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision
18. 52 ( 9) Vista 3/ 15/ 19)
does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel or land use, nor does
it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted. This
provision does not allow for the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an
on- site commercial message.
D. Rules for non- communicative aspects of signs. All rules and regulations
concerning the non- communicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination,
spacing, orientation, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process.
E. Billboard policy ( off-site, off-premises sign). The City completely prohibits the
construction, erection, use, or conversion to digital or electronic display of any billboards, as
defined in this chapter, other than the maintenance of billboards which were lawfully in
existence in the city, on the date on which the city first adopted an ordinance prohibiting
billboards or for which a valid permit has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on
which this provision is first adopted. The City adopts this policy pursuant to California
Government Code section 65850, California Business and Professions Code sections 5354( a)
and 5408. 3 ( both effective January 1, 2003). No permit shall be issued for any billboard which
violates this policy, and the City will take immediate abatement action against any billboard
constructed or maintained in violation of this policy. The City Council affirmatively declares that
it would have adopted this billboard policy even if it were the only provision in this chapter. The
City Council intends for this billboard policy to be severable and separately enforceable even if
other provision( s) of this chapter may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be
unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable. This provision does not prohibit agreements to
relocate presently existing, legal billboards, as encouraged by California Business and
Professions Code Section 5412.

Section 18. 52.050 General Regulations
A. Purpose and Intent. The general regulations set forth in this section are intended
to provide direction and parameters for the design, size, height and location of signs. The
requirements are minimum standards which, by themselves, may not achieve compatibility with
building architecture, the neighborhood and the community appearance to the degree required
by this chapter or other applicable requirements. In the course of reviewing sign permits, proper
consideration shall be given to the sign' s relationship to the overall appearance of the subject
property and surrounding area to achieve the goals and purposes of this chapter.
B. Sign Area
1. Definitions.
a. Sign area means the entire background area of a sign upon which
copy may be placed.
b. Copy area means the actual area of the visually communicative
imagery and sign copy applied to any background. In computing copy area, straight lines are

2. Computation of Sign Area
a. Single-faced Signs. The area of a sign shall be computed based
on the entire area within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of the sign

18. 52 ( 10) Vista 3/ 15/ 19)
b. Multiple- faced Signs. In the case of a sign which has two or more
faces, the area of all faces shall be included in computing the area of the sign, except that if two
such faces are placed back to back and are no more than 24 inches apart at any point, the area
of the sign shall be the area of one face, or the area of the larger face, if the two faces are
unequal in area. In the case of a sign of spherical, cylindrical, semi- cylindrical, or other irregular
shapes, the area of the sign shall be one- half of the surface area thereof.
C. Computation of Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at finished grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign.
D. Construction of Signs
1. All permanent sign faces shall be constructed of permanent materials
including, but not limited to, painted and/ or sandblasted wood, ceramic tile, applied letters,
carved wood, metal, plastic or other compatible, durable and waterproof material. No material
more combustible than treated wood shall be used in the construction of any permanent sign.
2. Structural design. Structural design of all signs shall conform to the
requirements of the Uniform Building Code, and all the applicable codes currently in effect.

tolerant, low maintenance plant materials in accordance with Chapter 18. 56. The type of
irrigation required will be dependent on the type of landscaping proposed.
4. All landscaped planter areas and plant materials shall be maintained in a
neat and healthy manner and shall be kept free of all debris and trash.
G. Relationship to Buildings and Other Signs
1. Signs located upon a lot with only one main building, shall be designed to

than one main building, such as a shopping center or other commercial or industrial complex,
shall be designed to incorporate at least one of such predominantly visual design elements
common to all such buildings or the buildings occupied by the " main tenants" or principal
enterprises.
18. 52 ( 12) Vista 3/ 15/ 19)
2. All such signs shall have designs which are well related to each other by
the similar treatment or incorporation of similar design elements, such as type of construction
materials, letter style of the sign copy, shape of the entire sign.
H. Maintenance
1. All signs shall comply with the following maintenance regulations.
a. All signs and sign supports shall be maintained in a clean and
safe condition.
b. Signs shall be maintained in a graffiti- free condition.

I. Specific Sign Prohibitions.
1. Signs in Public Right-of-Way. No signs shall be permitted to encroach on
any public right- of-way except as otherwise authorized by this chapter. Signs shall not be nailed
or attached to trees, traffic control devices or public utility poles. Any sign in violation of this
provision may be removed.
2. Unsafe Signs. Any sign which constitutes an immediate hazard to the
safety of any persons or property may be removed by the City upon ascertainment of such facts
by the City Planner or designee.
3. Signs not Specifically Permitted. Signs not specifically permitted by this
chapter, are hereby specifically prohibited.
4. New billboards are prohibited.
J. Mixed Use Zones. In any zone where both residential and non- residential uses
are allowed, the signage rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular use shall be
determined as follows: residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a residential
zone, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that
particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a Special Use Permit or
similar discretionary process.
K. Signs in Overlay Zones and Specific Plan Areas. All sign requirements of this
chapter are associated with the underlying zone in which the sign is proposed; however, overlay
zones and Specific Plan Areas adopted by the City may alter these requirements based upon
the specific conditions and circumstances.
L. Comprehensive Sign Program ( CSP)
1. A CSP shall be required for all new or rehabilitated commercial and
industrial centers consisting of two or more tenant spaces and multi- family residential projects of
more than two units. A CSP shall also be required for all projects requiring a Site Development
Plan, Special Use Permit, or for any signage proposal which deviates from the regulations
presented in this chapter.
2. When a Site Development Plan or Special Use Permit is required, the
CSP shall be concurrently submitted and evaluated. If a Site Development Plan or Special Use
Permit is not required, the CSP shall be reviewed independently by the City Planner. The
purpose of the program shall be to integrate signs with the building architectural design and
landscaping design into a unified theme. In order to achieve this purpose, all signs must comply
with the design standards stated herein:
a. Using the same background color on all signs or by using various
shades determined compatible by the City Planner. Use of compatible colors for the sign copy
shall be limited to three colors per sign.
b. Using visually consistent lettering, fonts, supports, and mounting
methods for signs.
C. Using the same form of illumination for all signs.
18. 52 ( 13) Vista 3/ 15/ 19)
3. Deviations from the requirements of this chapter for individual signs may
be allowed through an approved CSP if the applicant establishes that the deviation is
aesthetically justified and will, through a unifying theme, integrate the sign with the building
architectural design and landscaping design. Content of the sign shall not be considered in the
review.

accordance with Vista Development Code Section 18. 04. 150. At each stage of internal appeal
and review, the status quo shall be maintained pending the decision.

A. Authority. The City Manager or designee ( hereinafter referred to as " Officer") is
hereby authorized to enforce all provisions of this chapter.
B. Right of entry. When necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or when the Officer has reasonable cause to believe that there exists
any sign or any condition which makes such sign unsafe, the Officer may enter the premises or
building upon which such sign is located at all reasonable times to inspect the sign or to perform
any duty imposed upon the Officer by this chapter; provided that he/she shall first present

obtain an inspection warrant or other remedy as provided by law. In the absence of an
emergency, the Officer shall not remove an illegal, abandoned or nonconforming sign unless
directed to do so by resolution of the City Council to abate such illegal, abandoned or
nonconforming sign, or as provided in this chapter.
C. Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, limited liability company or

Section 18. 52. 140 Discontinued and Illegal Signs - Nuisance
A. Intent of provisions. This section is intended to encourage the display of signs
within the City that satisfy the requirements of this chapter by eliminating discontinued and
illegal signs in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Assuring that existing signs, over
time, comply with the provisions of this chapter is as important as prohibiting new signs that
violate this chapter.
B. Illegal and discontinued signs.
1. Any illegal or discontinued sign located within the city is declared to be a
public nuisance.
2. Partial exception for historical signs. Historical signs which were
constructed lawfully will not be classified as an illegal sign due to a nonconformity with the
requirements of this chapter if the City Council determines that the sign is historically significant
and makes the following findings:
a. The historical significance of the sign for the community outweighs
the non- conformity status of such sign.
b. The sign neither creates nor causes a traffic hazard.
C. The sign does not degrade the aesthetic quality of the community.
d. The sign is properly maintained and structurally sound.
e. The sign does not adversely affect adjacent properties.
For purposes of this section, the City Council makes the above findings
with respect to the two existing historical marquee signs located in the City.

A. LAND USES NOT SPECIFIED: The parking requirement for uses, not specifically
listed in this section, shall be determined by the approval body for the proposed use on the
basis of requirement for similar land uses. Traffic engineering and other planning data that are
appropriate to the establishment of a minimum parking requirement may also be used. This
criteria is intended to supplement the procedure set forth in Section 18. 58. 030 ( clarification of
use and regulation).
B. GENERAL PROVISIONS:
1. Modification of Parking Standards.
a. Variances. A variance may be granted from the requirements of
this section in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18.74 of this code.
b. Special Use Permits. Any land use subject to the granting of a
special use permit may have its parking requirements modified as an express condition of such
a permit.
C. Site Development Plan. Any land use or plot plan subject to the
approval of a site development plan may have its parking requirements modified as an express
condition of the approval of such a plan by the Planning Commission at a public hearing.
d. Specific Plans. A project subject to a specific plan may have its
parking requirements modified as a specific standard of the plan.
e. School facilities that include ancillary facilities for public assembly
such as gymnasium, sports arenas or stadiums, will provide additional parking spaces for such
facilities in the amount of one space for each five seats or 25 square feet of seating area,
whichever results in the greater number of parking spaces. Such additional parking may be
permanent, or may be temporary; e. g. athletic fields or other on- site open areas suitable for
parking on a temporary basis. This parking may also be provided with a reciprocal parking
agreement(s) with nearby property in conformance with the provisions of Section 18. 54. 130.

specified herein. Any eating/ dining establishment with less than 15 percent of the gross floor
area of a complex may be computed as other retail sales, or as may be appropriate for a
shopping center or building complex.
i. Parking spaces in a Multiple- Family Residential ( RM) zone,
covered or open, shall not be rented or leased separately from a residential unit(s):
1) One covered, or covered and enclosed ( garage) parking
space shall be specifically assigned to each dwelling unit.
2) All other open parking spaces shall be available, on an
equal basis, for use by any residential unit resident or visitor. ( NOTE: This standard shall only
18. 54 ( 10) Vista 2/ 14/ 20)
Vista Municipal Code

Section 18. 54. 130 Reciprocal Parking Facilities
A. Definition. For the purpose of this section, " reciprocal parking facilities"
means a single parking facility utilized by two or more land uses which experience their most
intense periods of use or activity at different times during a 24 hour period or on different days of
the week or month.
B. Authorization. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection C of this section,
the Planning Commission may, upon application by the owner or lessee of any property,
authorize the reciprocal use of parking facilities provided to serve any other property or use, to
satisfy the requirements of this chapter with respect to the applicant' s property and uses
thereon, in accordance with the provisions of this section.
1. Up to 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required by this chapter
for a daytime use may be provided by the parking spaces provided for a nighttime or Sunday
use, and up to 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required by this chapter for a
nighttime or Sunday use may be provided by the parking spaces provided for a daytime use.
2. Up to 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required by this chapter
for a church or an auditorium incidental to a school may be provided by the parking spaces
provided for a daytime use.
3. The Planning Commission shall determine which uses are daytime uses
and which uses are nighttime uses on the basis of evidence of hours of operation and times of
the day when motor vehicle traffic requires parking spaces with respect to the various uses for
which joint use is requested.
C. Conditions Required for Reciprocal Use.
1. The building or use for which application is being made for permission to
utilize the parking spaces provided for another building or use shall be located within 150 feet of
such parking spaces, provided however, the Planning Commission or City Council upon appeal
by a four-fifths vote, may extend this distance under reasonable circumstances, provided that
they make the finding that the extended distance is consistent with the purpose of this section.
Under no conditions, shall the distance be extended more than 300 feet from the building or use
in question.
2. The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in the
principal operating hours of the buildings or uses for which the joint use of parking is proposed.
3. The applicant shall furnish a recordable instrument, approved by the City
Attorney, guaranteeing the use of such parking spaces for the benefit of the applicant' s property
and the uses thereon for the duration of any uses which require that such parking facilities be
provided. Upon the approval of the request for reciprocal parking by the Planning Commission
or City Council, such instrument shall be recorded in the Office of the County Recorder;
provided, however, the Planning Commission or City Council upon appeal by a four-fifths vote
may waive the requirement for recordation if it is found that such recordation is not necessary
and would be detrimental to the interest of the concerned parties and the City. The instrument
18. 54 (23) Vista 2/ 14/ 20)
Vista Municipal Code
providing for the reciprocal parking shall state that it may be terminated only with the consent of
the City or, in addition, it shall provide that the owner of the property burdened by the reciprocal
parking requirement may terminate the reciprocal parking requirement by giving notice, in

Section 18. 56.010 Purpose
The State Legislature determined in the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act of 2006
the " Act "), Government Code Sections 65591 et seq., that the state' s water resources are in
limited supply. The Legislature also recognized that while landscaping is essential to the quality
of life in California, landscape design, installation, maintenance and management must be water
efficient. The purpose of this chapter is to establish water use standards, which implement the
requirements of the Act in order to:
A. Promote the values and benefits of landscape practices that integrate and go
beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;
B. Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining, and
managing water efficient landscapes;
C. Encourage the use, when available, of tertiary treated recycled /reclaimed water;
D. Use water efficiently and without waste by setting a Maximum Applied Water
Allowance ( MAWA) as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use for landscaping to the
lowest practical amount;
E. Encourage the modification of existing landscapes in order to reduce the amount
of water used for irrigation purposes. ( The City acknowledges that modification may require upfront
financial investment by property owners. However, this investment is intended to be
recovered over time due to the reduction in water use that leads directly to a reduction in cost
associated with that use.); and
F. Promote coordination among local jurisdictions and agencies relating to the
efficient use of water.

storm water management in connection with new and established landscape areas;
E. Preserve water resources by requiring water conservation methods to be
implemented in the design, development, and maintenance of landscaped areas;
F. Provide the property owner, builder, or developer with as much latitude as
possible when designing, installing, and maintaining the required landscaping while still
adhering to applicable provisions of the Act;
G. Establish landscape design and development standards and suggest plant
materials appropriate to develop consistent and high quality landscaping throughout the city;
H. Prevent the loss of topsoil via erosion and subsequent siltation of streams,
channels, estuaries, or lagoons;
I. Require the use of drought tolerant plant materials and water efficient irrigation
methods in new development and encourage their use when replacing existing landscaped
areas; and
J. Encourage the recognition and retention of existing landform, topography, and
native vegetation in project design to the maximum extent possible.

occupation to be permitted, the location, all necessary conditions, and any specific limitations
thereon. The permit shall be issued only if the City Planner is satisfied that the applicant is able
to comply with all conditions contained in this section, and the applicant has agreed in writing to
comply with such conditions during the effective period of the home occupation permit.
A. Limitations and Conditions. In general, a home occupation is an accessory
activity or secondary use so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal
circumstances, would not be aware of its existence. The limitations and conditions for home
occupation in this section are intended to ensure compatibility with other permitted activities or
uses and with the residential character of the neighborhood; thus, home occupations are
18. 58 ( 17) Vista 2/ 14/ 20)
Vista Municipal Code
permitted accessory activities or secondary uses in residential zoning districts only as long as all
limitations and conditions listed herein are complied with.

home as their sole residence. The occupation shall occur in no more than one room or 25
percent of the gross floor area of one floor of such residence, whichever is less.
2. No use shall require internal or external building alterations or involve onsite
construction related activities, including land clearing or grading activities.
3. No mechanical or electrical devices, equipment or tools shall be
permitted, except those items which are commonly associated with residential use or use
related to home crafts.
4. No home occupation shall cause a significant increase in the use of utility
services or public facilities as reasonably determined by the City Planner. Under no
circumstances, shall a five percent or greater increase be considered insignificant in any of the
utilities.
5. There shall be no outside storage of any kind related to the home
occupation, including the parking or storage of vehicles identified with the business either on the
site ( out in the open) or on any public or private road. The work vehicle, regardless of it being
used as private vehicle, must be parked or stored within a structure at all times and have a
payload of one ton or less. The work vehicle can be used for storage of materials directly
related to the operation of the home occupation. Any storage confined within a garage shall not
interfere with the original intended use of a garage, that is, for parking purposes. If additional
storage space is needed, the applicant shall secure an off-site location for storage purposes and
provide the City with a copy of the associated lease agreement along with the home occupation
application.
6. The use may not increase pedestrian or vehicular traffic flow or increase
parking demand in excess of the normal expected residential demand in the surrounding area.

Section 18. 58.500 Satellite Antennas
A. Purpose and Intent.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable and
uniform standards for the installation of satellite antennas within the city. This section shall be
used by the general public, the development services center, the Zoning Administrator and the
Board of Appeals in considering plans and applications for satellite antennas. Plans shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator (Director of Planning) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 18. 74.260.
2. Intent. It is intended that these standards be utilized to effectively screen
satellite antennas so that they shall not be intrusive to residential and commercial or industrial
landscapes or be utilized for purposes other than their designed function, such as commercial
signs advertising a dealer's place of business, nor should they interfere with the direct line of
sight reception of such antennas.
B. Permitted Antennas. Satellite antennas, as defined in Section 18. 02. 080, are
permitted as accessory uses in all zoning districts subject to the provisions of the applicable
zoning district regulations, those contained in this section and the issuance of a satellite
antenna permit. Deviations from these regulations may be permitted by a satellite antenna
permit issued in accordance with the provisions of Section 18. 74.260.
1. A satellite antenna shall be an accessory use of the subject property.
2. Satellite antennas shall be ground mounted.
3. Satellite antennas shall not be permitted on properties which have been
designated as historic sites.

minimum six-foot-high solid fence, wall or hedge exists or is installed between an antenna and the
property line, or on the property line.
C. Exceptions. A satellite antenna that does not have a dish element, that is
generally circular and reflective and has a diameter, or its equivalent, of less than two feet is not
subject to the requirements of this section.
D. Design Standards. The design standards set forth in this subsection shall be
used in evaluating the placement of antennas in all zoning districts. The reviewing authority
may approve alternative locations and screening if they substantially comply with the purpose
and intent of this section.
1. Antennas shall be screened so that not more than 25 percent of the
antenna height is visible at grade from any public property or rights- of-way.
a. Screening for ground- mounted mesh antennas shall be achieved
by utilization of one of the following: existing or proposed structures ( which may be solid fence or
18. 58 (21) Vista 2/ 14/ 20)
Vista Municipal Code
wall), plant materials, earth berms or earth depressions. If the antennas are of a solid ( opaque)
material, two of the screening methods in Subsection ( D) ( 1) shall be utilized.
b. Screening for roof-mounted antennas, and pole mounts which
extend to the roof, shall be achieved by recessing the antennas into the roof line, or by
constructing a screen of similarly textured roofing or exterior wall material. Roof-mounted
antennas, when visible from public properties, including rights- of-way, at significantly higher
elevations, shall not exceed the highest point of the roof of the structure.
2. All antennas shall be similar in color and tone to adjacent screening
and/ or blend with adjacent landscaping; for example, in the case of roof-mounted antennas, this

standards of the applicable zoning district regulations ( yard requirements, coverages, etc.) and
those set forth in this section. Where there is a conflict between district standards and those
established in this section, the more restrictive shall apply.
1. Residential Zoning Districts. Antennas shall be subject to the following:
a. Installation in front and side street yards is prohibited.
b. Antennas shall comply with the coverage requirements of the
subject zoning district regulations where applicable. The method of calculation shall be based

percent of their height projects above the screening. When mounted on a pole which extends
the full height of the adjacent structure, antennas shall comply with the intent of the screening for
roof-mounted antennas.
F. Nonconforming Antennas. Nonconforming satellite antennas erected prior to the
effective date of the amendment codified in this section shall be brought into compliance with all
18. 58 (22) Vista 2/ 14/ 20)

follows:
a. Upon the adoption of an order by the Planning Commission or the
City Council, the Planning Commission shall give notice of a public hearing, as provided by

at a public hearing the abatement of the nonconforming use of any accessory buildings and/ or
structures used for the raising of rabbits, poultry or animals.
b. Subject to the provisions of Subdivision ( 6)( c) of this subsection,
all such accessory buildings or structures are hereby granted an automatic exception for a
period of eight years from the effective date of the adoptive ordinance, or in those cases of
future annexation of affected property, eight years after consummation of such annexation and
such automatic exception shall terminate without further hearing at the expiration of such eight
years; provided, however, in the event the accessory buildings and structures are not removed
or abated at the termination of the automatic exception period, the Planning Commission shall
hold a hearing to determine whether or not the accessory buildings and structures are in

structures to be in violation of this code, it shall order the abatement thereof within 90 days.
C. After hearing by the Planning Commission, the automatic
exception provided in Subdivision ( 6)( b) of this subsection may be modified or revoked at any
time in less than such eight-year period upon findings that:
i. The use for which the building or structure is used is
detrimental to the public health or safety or so as to be a public nuisance; or
ii. Where such use can be revoked without the impairment of
constitutional rights of the operator of the nonconforming use upon consideration of the value of
the improvements, the replacement cost less depreciation, and the ability of such improvements
to be relocated at reasonable expense to the operator of the nonconforming use.
d. The Planning Commission shall consider the depreciation period
to commence from the date of construction of such accessory buildings and structures or the
use of a substantial portion thereof, whichever first occurs.

Section 18.72. 110 Abatement Date Determined by Planning Commission
A. When any nonconforming conditions exist in any zoning district, other than the
nonconforming use of land when no structure is involved, it shall be the responsibility of the
Planning Commission, on its own initiative, or upon referral of the City Council, to make a formal
determination of the date upon which the nonconforming building was established.
B. It shall also be the responsibility of the Planning Commission to determine
whether, by reason of structural alterations or enlargement, or the installation of major
equipment designed into the building prior to the effective date of the amendment codified in this
section, it is deemed necessary to establish a later date for abatement than that prescribed
herein for the building in order to assure that the investment represented by such structural
alterations, enlargements or equipment installations may be amortized.
C. In performing this function, the commission shall consider all pertinent data in
connection therewith to provide the opportunity for the owner of record, lien holder, if any,
lessee, if there be such, to present such evidence as they may possess and which properly
relates to such case.
D. When the date of abatement has been determined, the Commission, by
resolution, shall establish such date and shall set forth such facts as bear upon the case upon
which the determination of such date of abatement is based, and shall formally notify the owner
of such nonconforming property of the action of the Commission by mailing to such owner a
copy of the formally adopted resolution not later than ten days following the date of subject
action by the Planning Commission.
E. Any action by the Planning Commission under this section shall be subject to
appeal to the City Council in the same manner as provided for other appeals from decisions of
the Planning Commission.

Section 18. 74.010 Purpose and Intent of Provisions
A. Purpose. The sole purpose of any variance shall be to permit parity in land use,
and no variance shall be granted that would have the effect of granting a special privilege to a
property not shared by other properties in the same vicinity and zoning district. The purpose of a
special use permit is to provide a means whereby certain specified facilities and activities may
be permitted at a given location when it is determined that a facility or activity is necessary or
desirable and will contribute to the general convenience or welfare of the neighborhood or
community.
B. Intent. The variance process is intended to provide relief to property when
practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships or results inconsistent with the general purposes of
this title result from the strict literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this title.
The special use permit is intended to ensure that facilities and activities subject to such are
made compatible with the neighborhood or community in which they propose to locate, will
provide a necessary or desirable service or facility, and will not create undue disturbance or
18. 74 ( l) Vista 4/ 11/ 14)

hazards to the health, safety or general welfare of the residents, and is not injurious to property
or improvements in the vicinity.

that adjustments of ten percent variation or less may be granted in accordance with Section
18. 74. 260.
B. A change in the required location of accessory facilities and activities, and the
building site front.
C. Repealed
D. The modification of provisions regulating signs and sign structures
E. To allow the issuance of building or grading permits on parcels of land having
access of less than a 20- foot width on a public street as required by Section 18. 02. 385 to qualify
as a legal lot and building site, as set forth in this subsection:
1. Evidence. In addition to any other findings which must be made in order
to grant a variance, the following findings must be made to grant a variance for a reduction in the
width of any required access strip:
a. That the parcel has legally recorded access to a public street
either directly or by way of an access strip of at least ten feet in width, which is topographically
traversable by vehicular traffic.
b. That it would be a hardship to require other access to the parcel or
to widen any existing access strip.
C. That sufficient horizontal and vertical clearance exists to permit
emergency vehicles with dimensions of 13 feet 6 inches in height, 9 feet in width, and 36 feet in
length to gain access to and egress from the parcel,
d. That the access strip was not established after January 21, 1976.
2. Conditions. The following shall be imposed as conditions of such a
variance:
a. A certificate of compliance as provided for in the subdivision
ordinance shall be filed with the County Recorder with respect to the parcel.
b. If the parcel is in a zone district other than the E- 1, A- 1, R- 1 or R-
1- B zones, a site development plan must be filed with the application for a variance pursuant to
Chapter 18. 64, and a granting of the variance shall be conditioned upon development in
substantial conformance with an approved site development plan.
C. Any other condition which is reasonably necessary or appropriate
to ensure that the required findings for the variances are fulfilled.

generally to the property or class of use in the same vicinity and zoning district.
B. That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone and denied
to the property for which the variance is sought.
18. 74 ( 2) Vista 4/ 11/ 14)

Section 18. 84.010 Purpose
It is the intent of this ordinance to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts,
increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can
be brought about by the presence of adult-oriented businesses in close proximity to
incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or
uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that adultoriented
businesses cause an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase
in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and
residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this ordinance to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent adult-oriented businesses from locating in close
proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult- oriented businesses in
certain areas.

extension of the amortization period within four City business days of the public hearing required

code. The decision of the hearing officer shall be hand delivered or mailed in accordance with

consideration by the City of the pending application. Extensions of time sought by applicants
shall not be considered delay on the part of the City or constitute failure by the City to provide
for prompt decisions on applications.
E. In rendering its decision to grant or deny the extension, the hearing officer shall
determine whether the adult-oriented business has been provided with a reasonable
amortization period commensurate with the financial investment involved. If the hearing officer
determines that the amortization period is not reasonable, it shall prescribe an amortization
period that is commensurate with the financial investment involved. The burden shall be on the
applicant to establish that an extension should be granted. The hearing officer shall consider
the following facts in making its determination:
1. The amount of the adult-oriented business owner' s financial investment,
excluding goodwill, in the existing adult-oriented business through the date of passage and
approval of this ordinance;
2. The amount of such investment that has been or will be realized through
the effective date;
3. The life expectancy of the existing adult-oriented business;
4. Whether any such structures have depreciated below a reasonable
salvageable value, taking into consideration the applicable Internal Revenue Service
depreciation schedules;
5. The existence or nonexistence of obligations pursuant to any lease,
sublease and/ or extensions to that lease or sublease, as well as any contingency clauses
therein permitting termination of such lease;
6. The cost of relocating the business to a site conforming with the
provisions of this chapter;
7. The ability of the business and/ or land owner to change the use to a
conforming use;
8. The date upon which the property owner and/ or business operator
received notice of the nonconforming status of the use and the amortization requirements; and
9. The effects on the health, safety and welfare of surrounding businesses
and uses if an extension is granted, including any prior incidents of illicit sexual activity at the
adult facility.
F. The hearing officer' s decision shall be in writing, and shall be hand delivered or
sent by certified mail to the applicant, and shall be noticed in accordance with the provisions of
this code.

be valid for operation at any other location. If the hearing officer grants the application, the
applicant may continue operation until the date specified for closure in the written order granting
the extension.
H. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final and subject to judicial review
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.8. Any applicant or license holder

18. 86.010 Purpose
This chapter provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons
with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act ( the " Acts") in the application of zoning laws and
other land use regulations, policies and procedures.
Ord. No. 2007- 10, Added, 6/ 26/ 07)
18. 86.020 Applicability
A. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a
disability, or by an entity acting on behalf of a person or persons with disabilities, to provide or
secure equal access to housing when the application of a zoning law or other land use
regulation, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A person with a
disability is: a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits
one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone
who has a record of such impairment. This section is intended to apply to those persons who
are defined as disabled under the Acts.
B. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or
exception to the rules, standards, development and use of housing or housing- related facilities
that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability with equal
opportunity to housing of their choice. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made
in the manner prescribed by Section 18. 86. 030.
C. If a request for reasonable accommodation is granted, the request shall be
granted to an individual and shall not run with the land unless it is determined that: ( 1) the
modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed
or altered to comply with the code, or (2) the accommodation is to be used by another individual
with a disability.
Ord. No. 2007- 10, Added, 6/ 26/ 07)
18. 86.030 Application Requirements
A request for reasonable accommodation shall be initiated by submitting a completed
application form, signed by the property owner or authorized agent, accompanied by the
required fee, and the following information submitted in the form of a letter to the City Planner:
A. The applicant' s name, address and telephone number.
18. 86 (l) Vista 7/ 19/ 11)
Vista Municipal Code
B. The street address and assessor' s parcel number of the property for which the
request is being made.
C. The current actual use of the property.
D. The basis for the claim that the individual ( or group of individuals, if application is
made by an entity acting on behalf of a person or persons with disabilities) is considered
disabled under the Acts.
E. The zoning law, provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable
accommodation is being requested.
F. Why the requested accommodation is necessary to make the specific property
accessible to the individual or group of individuals.
G. Credible documentation shall be provided with respect to each element
described above so that the City can fully evaluate the application and verify the factual basis
underlying the need for the accommodation. The documentation shall be provided in a manner
to permit the City to independently make this assessment.
Ord. No. 2007- 10, Added, 6/ 26/ 07)
18. 86.040 Review Authority and Procedure
A. Requests for reasonable accommodation associated with a ministerial land use,
building, or similar determination shall be reviewed by the person or authority with responsibility
to act on the associated ministerial determination. Such person or authority shall make a written
determination within 45 days and either grant, grant with modifications or deny such a request
for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 18. 86.050.
B. Requests for reasonable accommodation associated with a discretionary land
use, building, or similar determination shall be reviewed by the person or authority with
responsibility to make such determination. Notice and hearing shall be as required for the
associated discretionary land use, building, or other determination. Such person or authority
shall make a written determination and either grant, grant with modifications or deny such a
request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 18. 86.050.
C. Unless waived by the City Planner to satisfy applicable legal standards binding
the City, an application for reasonable accommodation must be submitted with and processed
concurrently with an application for the associated land use, building, or similar determination,
whether such determination is ministerial or discretionary. Such request for reasonable
accommodation shall be made on a separate document that is appended to the other
application or applications for the associated ministerial or discretionary determinations. The
document or pages requesting the reasonable accommodation shall include all of the
information required by this chapter and shall be clearly identified as a request for reasonable
accommodation. When the City Planner waives the need to submit an application that would
ordinarily be associated with a request for reasonable accommodation, the request for
reasonable accommodation shall be considered by the person or entity that would ordinarily act
on the determination which has been waived, and notice and hearing shall be as required for
the determination which has been waived.
D. A request for a reasonable accommodation that would waive or modify the notice
and hearing requirements of Sections 18. 86. 040B and 18. 86.040C shall be reviewed by the City
Planner. The City Planner shall make a written determination within 15 days and shall either
grant, grant with modifications or deny the request in accordance with Section 18. 86. 050.

Vista Municipal Code
18. 86.050 Findings and Decision
A. The written decision to grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for
reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts. The reviewing authority may grant
the requested accommodation or grant it with modifications if all of the following findings can be
made:
1. The housing which is the subject of the request will be used by an
individual or a group of individuals considered disabled under the Acts.
2. The accommodation requested is reasonable and necessary to make
specific housing available to the individual or group of individuals with disability or disabilities
under the Acts.
3. The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the City.
4. The requested reasonable accommodation would not require a
fundamental alteration in the nature of a City program or law, including but not limited to, land
use and zoning.
B. In making a decision regarding the reasonableness of the requested
accommodation, the evaluation may consider, among other factors, the following:
1. Whether there are alternative reasonable accommodations available that
would provide an equivalent level of benefit.
2. Whether the requested reasonable accommodation substantially affects
the physical attributes of the property or has impacts on surrounding properties that would
fundamentally alter a City program or law.
3. In the case of a determination involving a one-family dwelling, whether
the household would be considered a single housekeeping unit if it were not using the special
services that are required because of the disabilities of the residents.
C. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may
impose any conditions of approval needed to ensure that the reviewing authority can make the
findings required in Subsection A of this section. Conditions may include, but are not limited to,
ensuring that any removable structures or physical design features that are constructed or
installed in association with a reasonable accommodation be removed once those structures or
physical design features are unnecessary to provide access to the dwelling unit for the current
occupants.

18. 86.060 Appeal of Determination
The sole means of reviewing the decision of the approving authority ( City Planner or
other approving body) to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable
accommodation is by filing an appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, City Planner,
Planning Commission, or other approving body as provided in this title.

factors typically considered in determining whether a development provides a rate of return
typically required by developers. Grants and subsidies from the government or third parties
shall not be considered in this calculation, unless the developer provides adequate security to
substitute for the grant or subsidy in the event that it is not actually contributed to the affordable
units.

Section 18. 90.040 Amount of Density Bonus
A. General. Eligible projects shall receive density bonuses equal to the bonus
required to satisfy state law. The City Planner shall distribute density bonus regulations to
interested persons, free of charge, setting forth authorized density bonuses based on project
type. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an applicant from accepting a density bonus, which is
less than the minimum required under state law.
B. Aggregation Rules. The density bonus available to an eligible residential project
listed in clauses ( 1) through ( 4) of Section 18. 90. 030.A may be aggregated with the density
bonuses available for providing a day care facility or for a project that provides a qualifying land
dedication. No other form of aggregation shall be permitted and a density bonus, when
aggregated, may not exceed 35 percent.
C. Maximum Allowable Residential Density. When the zoning ordinance sets a
maximum density in a single family zone by establishing a minimum lot area for each lot, the
maximum allowable residential density for the project will be the maximum number of lots that
can be legally established on a project site under the applicable zoning and General Plan, after
taking into account all characteristics particular to the site. That number would then be
increased by the applicable density bonus percentage, and rounded upwards if the resulting
number is not a whole number. In no event shall the maximum allowable residential density
provided by this definition be applied to a development project in a way to produce a lower
density than the minimum, which would be required by Section 65915 of the Government Code.
D. Regulatory Agreement. A regulatory agreement shall be recorded against any
property receiving a density bonus or which will provide affordable housing pursuant to this
chapter. The agreement shall be recorded at the earliest time possible, but in all events, prior to
issuing a building permit, or in the case of subdivisions, prior to approving a final map.

Section 18. 90.050 Number of Concessions
A. Calculating Number of Concessions. Eligible residential developments shall
receive concession( s) in a number to satisfy the minimum requirements of state law, unless the
applicant agrees to a lesser number or the City makes the findings to deny the concessions in
accordance with Section 18. 90.080. 13. The City Planner shall distribute program regulations to
interested persons, free of charge, which set forth the authorized number of land use
concessions based on project type. For purposes of this calculation, each individual deviation
or incentive from the zoning requirements, rules, or other standards or conditions of the City
shall constitute a separate concession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a variation in one
standard or requirement shall constitute only one concession if, by necessity, the one variation
results in the automatic and unavoidable variation in a second standard.
B. Select Projects; Concessions Unavailable. Concessions shall not be provided to:
1) senior citizen housing developments; or ( 2) a development which obtains its entire density
bonus entitlement through a qualifying land dedication.
C. Redevelopment Projects. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code,
additional concessions may be granted beyond those permitted by paragraphs A and B if: ( 1)
the housing development is subject to a contract with the Community Development Commission
of the City of Vista; (2) the contract authorizes the land owner or developer to request City
18. 90 (6) Vista 11/ 24/ 17)

approval of such additional concessions; ( 3) the grant of the additional concession(s) is
required to render the affordable housing feasible; and ( 4) the City affirmatively determines that
approval of the additional concession is required to advance the interests of the community and
can occur without any adverse impact.
D. Regulatory Agreement. A regulatory agreement shall be recorded against any
property receiving a concession pursuant to this chapter. The agreement shall be recorded at
the earliest time possible, but in all events, prior to issuing a building permit, or in the case of
subdivisions, prior to approving a final map.

Section 18.90.060 Supplemental Density Bonuses and Concessions
A. Child Care Facilities.
1. Unless the City, in accordance with Government Code Section 65915( i),
makes a finding that it has adequate child care facilities, an eligible project shall receive an
additional density bonus or an additional concession if it provides a qualified day care facility.
2. The City shall decide whether it provides an additional density bonus or
an additional concession pursuant to this section. If an additional density bonus is provided, the
additional residential area shall equal the square footage of the qualified child care facility. If a
concession is provided, it shall contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of the
construction of the qualified child care facility.
3. An additional density bonus may not be granted which causes the total
density bonuses for the project to collectively exceed 35 percent. The City shall not be
obligated to grant the additional density bonus or provide an additional concession if it finds,
pursuant to Government Code Section 65915( i), that the City has adequate child care facilities.
4. A regulatory agreement shall be recorded against any property receiving
a density bonus by requiring the operation of the qualified day care facility for a period equal or
exceeding the affordability period. The agreement shall be recorded at the earliest time
possible, but in all events, prior to issuing a building permit, or in the case of subdivisions, prior
to approving a final map.
B. Projects with Qualifying Land Dedications.
1. A project that qualifies for a density bonus pursuant to Section
18. 90.030(A)( 1) through ( A)(4) can receive a supplemental density bonus by providing a
qualifying land dedication. The amount of the supplemental density bonus shall be determined
in accordance with Government Code Section 65915( h), provided that the aggregate density
bonus shall not exceed 35 percent.
2. A regulatory agreement shall be recorded against any property receiving
a supplemental density bonus or which will be used to provide affordable housing. The
agreement shall be recorded at the earliest time possible, but in all events, prior to issuing a
building permit, or in the case of subdivisions, prior to approving a final map.

A. The City of Vista intends this Chapter to establish reasonable and uniform
standards and procedures for wireless facilities deployment, construction, installation, collocation,
modification, operation, relocation and removal within the City' s territorial boundaries, consistent
with and to the extent permitted under federal and California state law. The standards and
procedures contained in this Chapter are intended to, and should be applied to, protect and

advanced wireless services with the City' s local values, which include without limitation the
aesthetic character of the City, its neighborhoods and community.
B. This Chapter is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: ( 1) prohibit
or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider' s ability to provide personal wireless
services; (2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity' s ability to provide any interstate or intrastate
telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules or
regulation for rights- of-way management; (3) unreasonably discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent services; ( 4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or
modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal Communication Commission' s
regulations concerning such emissions; ( 5) prohibit any collocation or modification that the City
may not deny under federal or California state law; or (6) otherwise authorize the City to preempt
any applicable federal or California state law.

Section 18. 92.020 Definitions
The abbreviations, phrases, terms and words in this Chapter will have the meanings
assigned to them in this Section 18. 92. 020 or, as may be appropriate, in Chapter 18. 02 ( Purpose,
Interpretation and Definitions), as may be amended from time to time, unless context indicates
otherwise. Undefined phrases, terms or words in this section will have the meanings assigned to
them in 47 U. S. C. § 702, as may be amended from time to time, and, if not defined therein, will
have their ordinary meanings. In the event that any definition assigned to any phrase, term or
18. 92 ( 1) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)
Vista Municipal Code
word in this section conflicts with any federal or state- mandated definition, the federal or statemandated
definition will control.
Approval Authority" means the commission, board or official responsible for review of
permit applications and vested with the authority to approve or deny such applications. The
approval authority for a project which requires a minor use permit or administrative temporary use
permit refers to the Zoning Administrator. The approval authority for a project which requires a
special use permit refers to the Planning Commission.
Base Station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1), as
may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that
enables FCC- licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a
communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 9) or any equipment associated with a tower. The term includes, but is not limited to,
equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and
public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such
as microwave backhaul. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas,
coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment,
regardless of technological configuration ( including distributed antenna systems and small- cell
networks). The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant
application is filed with the State or local government under this section, supports or houses
equipment described in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1)( i)-( ii) that has been reviewed and approved
under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review
process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such
support. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed
with the State or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment
described in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1)( i)-( ii).
Collocation" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 2), as
may be amended, which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission
equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/ or receiving radio
frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC' s
definition effectively means " to add" and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless
facility installed at a single site.
Completely Stealth" means concealment techniques that completely screen all
transmission equipment from public view and integrate the transmission equipment with the
surrounding natural and/ or built environment such that, given the particular context, the average,
untrained observer does not recognize the existence of the wireless facility and concealment
technique. Stealth concealment techniques include, but are not limited to: ( 1) transmission
equipment placed completely within existing architectural features such that the installation
causes no visible change to the underlying structure and ( 2) new architectural features that mimic
the underlying building in architectural style, physical proportion and quality of construction
materials. Architectural features commonly used as stealth concealment include, but are not

adjacent sites with the proposed site, and predicted service coverage levels from the proposed
site without all adjacent sites.
9. Alternatives Analysis. The applicant must list all existing structures
considered as alternatives to the proposed location, together with a general description of the site
design considered at each location. The applicant must also provide a written explanation for why
the alternatives considered were unacceptable or infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with
the development standards in this Chapter as the proposed location and design. This explanation
must include a meaningful comparative analysis and such technical information and other factual
justification as are necessary to document the reasons why each alternative is unacceptable,
infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with the development standards in this Chapter as the
proposed location. If an existing wireless facility is listed among the alternatives, the applicant
must specifically address why the collocation or modification of such wireless facility is not a viable
option. If the proposed location is in the public right-of-way, the applicant may perform the
alternatives sites analysis on other locations that it considered in the public right- of-way.
C. Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. The City shall not review any application
unless duly filed in accordance with the provisions in this Section 18. 92. 050( c).
1. Pre- Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, applicants must
schedule and attend a pre- submittal conference with City staff for all proposed wireless facilities
that require a special use permit. The City strongly encourages, but does not require, a presubmittal
conference for all other proposed wireless facilities. The pre- submittal conference is
intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without
limitation, the appropriate project classification and permit requirements, concealment
opportunities and/ or concerns, potential alternative sites and/ or designs, requirements for a
complete application, scheduling matters and coordination with other City departments
responsible for application review. To minimize unnecessary delays due to application
incompleteness, applicants are encouraged ( but not required) to bring any draft applications or
other materials so that City staff may provide informal feedback about whether such applications
or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Zoning Administrator may, in the
Zoning Administrator' s discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under
Section 18. 92. 050( c)( 2) and/ or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any
applicant who ( i) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre- submittal conference and ( ii)
shows to the Zoning Administrator' s satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates
information already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to
the City' s review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will
be limited to the project discussed at the pre-submittal conference and will not be extended to any
other project.
2. Submittal Appointment. All applications must be filed with the City at a prescheduled
appointment. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but
may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not
prejudicial to other applicants. Any application received without an appointment, whether
delivered in- person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the
applicant received a written exemption from the Zoning Administrator at a pre- submittal
conference.
3. Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal
process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request to the Zoning
18. 92 ( 6) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)
Vista Municipal Code
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment
as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received.
D. Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions,
an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails
to tender a substantive response to the City within 90 calendar days after the City deems the
application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Zoning Administrator may, in the
Zoning Administrator' s discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 calendar
days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to
grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant' s reasonable control will
be considered good cause to grant the extension.
E. Departmental Forms, Rules and Other Regulations. The City Council authorizes
the Zoning Administrator to develop and publish permit application forms, checklists, informational
handouts and other related materials for this Chapter. Without further authorization from the City
Council, the Zoning Administrator may from time-to- time update and alter the permit application
forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials as the Zoning Administrator
deems necessary or appropriate to respond to regulatory, technological or other changes related
to this Chapter. The City Council further authorizes the Zoning Administrator to establish other
reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for
appointments with applicants, as the Zoning Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to
organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations
must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.

noise limit in the subject zoning district. The approval authority may require the applicant to
incorporate appropriate noise- baffling materials and/ or strategies whenever necessary to avoid
any ambient noise from equipment reasonably likely to exceed the applicable limit.
5. Landscaping. Wireless facilities must include landscape features when
proposed in a landscaped area. The approval authority may require additional landscape features
to screen the wireless facility from public view, avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts on
adjacent properties or otherwise enhance the concealment required under this Chapter.
6. Security Measures. Wireless facilities may incorporate reasonable and
appropriate security measures, such as fences, walls and anti- climbing devices, to prevent
unauthorized access, theft and vandalism. Security measures must be designed to enhance
concealment to the maximum extent possible. The approval authority may require additional
concealment elements as the approval authority finds necessary to blend the security measures
and other improvements into the natural and/ or built environment. The approval authority shall
not approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security measures.
7. Backup Power Sources. The approval authority may approve permanent
backup power sources and/ or generators on a case- by-case basis. All backup power sources
and/ or generators must be compliant with all generally applicable rules and regulations for public
health and safety, and the approval authority may require conditions reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure such compliance. The City strongly disfavors backup power sources
mounted on the ground or on poles in the public rights-of-way.
8. Lights. Wireless facilities may not include exterior lights other than ( i) as
may be required under FAA, FCC or other applicable governmental regulations; and ( ii) timed or
motion- sensitive lights for security and/ or worker safety. All exterior lights permitted or required to
be installed must be installed in locations and within enclosures that avoids illumination impacts
on other properties to the maximum extent feasible.
9. Signage; Advertisements. All wireless facilities must include signage that
accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the owner/operator' s site name or
identification number and a toll- free number to the owner/operator's network operations center.
Wireless facilities may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved
by the City, required by law or recommended under FCC or other United States governmental
agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations.
10. Future Collocations. All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in a
manner that contemplates future collocations, and will facilitate additional equipment to be
integrated into the proposed wireless facility or associated structures with no or negligible visual
changes to its outward appearance to the greatest extent feasible.
11. Utilities. All cables and connectors for telephone, primary electric and other
similar utility services must be routed underground to the extent feasible in conduits large enough
to accommodate future collocated wireless facilities. The approval authority shall not approve new
overhead utility lines or service drops merely because compliance with the undergrounding
requirements would increase the project cost.
12. Compliance with Laws. All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, restrictions and
conditions, which includes without limitation the California Building Standards Code, General Plan
and any specific plan, the Vista Development Code and any conditions or restrictions in any permit
or other governmental approval issued by any public agency with jurisdiction over the project.
B. Freestanding Wireless facilities.
18. 92 ( 10) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)
Vista Municipal Code
1. Tower-Mounted Equipment. All tower-mounted equipment must be
mounted as close to the vertical support structure as possible to reduce its visual profile.
Applicants must mount non- antenna, tower-mounted equipment ( including, but not limited to,
remote radio units/ heads, surge suppressors and utility demarcation boxes) directly behind the
antennas to the maximum extent feasible. All tower-mounted equipment, cables and hardware
must be painted with flat colors subject to the approval authority' s prior approval.
2. Ground- Mounted Equipment and Shelters. All ground- mounted equipment
must be concealed within an existing or new structure, opaque fences or other enclosures subject
to the approval authority' s prior approval. The approval authority may require additional
concealment elements as the approval authority finds necessary to blend the ground- mounted
equipment and other improvements into the natural and/ or built environment.
C. Building- Mounted Wireless facilities.
1. Preferred Concealment Techniques. All applicants should, to the extent
feasible, propose new non- tower wireless facilities that are completely concealed and
architecturally integrated into the existing facade or rooftop features with no visible impacts from
any publicly accessible areas at ground level ( examples include, but are not limited to, antennas
behind existing parapet walls or facades replaced with RF- transparent material and finished to
mimic the replaced materials). Alternatively, when integration with existing building features is not
feasible, the applicant should propose completely concealed new structures or appurtenances
designed to mimic the support structure' s original architecture and proportions (examples include,
but are not limited to, cupolas, steeples, chimneys and water tanks). Facilities must be located
behind existing parapet walls or other existing screening elements to the maximum extent
feasible.
2. Facade- Mounted Equipment. When wireless facilities cannot be placed
behind existing parapet walls or other existing screening elements, the approval authority may
approve facade- mounted equipment in accordance with this section. All facade- mounted
equipment must be concealed behind screen walls and mounted as flush to the facade as
practicable. The approval authority may not approve "pop- out" screen boxes unless the design is
architecturally consistent with the original building or support structure. Except in industrial zones,
the approval authority may not approve any exposed facade- mounted antennas, including but not
limited to exposed antennas painted to match the facade.
3. Rooftop- Mounted Equipment. All rooftop- mounted equipment must be
screened from public view with concealment measures that match the underlying structure in
proportion, quality, architectural style and finish. The approval authority may approve unscreened
rooftop equipment only when it expressly finds that such equipment is effectively concealed due
to its low height and/ or setback from the roofline.
4. Associated Ground- Mounted Equipment. Outdoor ground- mounted
equipment associated with building- mounted wireless facilities must be avoided whenever
feasible. In publicly visible or accessible locations, applicants must conceal outdoor groundmounted
equipment with opaque fences or landscape features that mimic the adjacent
structure( s) such as dumpster corrals and other accessory structures.
D. Right-of-Way Wireless Facilities.
1. Concealment. All wireless facilities in the right- of-way must be concealed
to the maximum extent feasible with design elements and techniques that mimic or blend with the
underlying support structure, surrounding environment and adjacent uses. Such concealment
techniques may include, without limitation, placing equipment underground or within landscaped
areas, painting or coloring the equipment, mounting the equipment behind existing street signage
or rotating the equipment away from prominent views, installing passively cooled equipment
rather than fan- cooled equipment, covering any solid or flashing indicator lights on the internal
components. In addition, wireless facilities in the rights-of-way may not unreasonably subject the
18. 92 ( 11) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)
Vista Municipal Code
public use, for any purpose including expressive or aesthetic purposes, to inconvenience,
discomfort, trouble, annoyance, hindrance, impediment or obstruction.
2. Support Structures. All wireless facilities in the public right- of-way must be
installed on existing above- ground structures whenever possible and desirable. Existing aboveground
structures may be replaced with hardened support structures so long as the replacement
structure is substantially similar to the existing structure to be replaced. The approval authority
shall not approve any new, non- replacement support structures unless: ( i) the applicant
demonstrates that above-ground support structures near the project site either do not exist or are
not available to the applicant; or ( ii) the approval authority finds that a new, non- replacement
support structure would be more desirable and consistent with the objectives in this Chapter than
installations on existing structures near the project site.
3. Undergrounded Equipment. To conceal the non- antenna equipment,
applicants for a proposed wireless facility within any area in which the existing utilities are primarily
located underground shall underground all non- antenna equipment other than any required
electric meter or disconnect switch. In all other areas, applicants shall install all non- antenna
equipment underground to the extent feasible. Additional expense to install and maintain an
underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement, except
where the applicant demonstrates with evidence that this requirement will effectively prohibit the
provision of personal wireless services.
4. Pole- Mounted Equipment. All pole-mounted equipment must be installed
as close to the pole as technically and legally feasible to minimize impacts to the visual profile. All
required or permitted signage in the rights- of-way must face toward the street or otherwise placed
to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures. All conduits, conduit attachments,
cables, wires and other connectors must be concealed from public view to the extent feasible.
5. Ground- Mounted Equipment. To the extent that the equipment cannot be
placed underground as required, applicants must install ground- mounted equipment in the
location so that it does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. The approval authority may
require landscaping as a condition of approval to conceal ground- mounted equipment.

Section 18. 92.090 Standard Conditions of Approval
In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approval authority, all special use permits
and minor use permits, whether approved by the approval authority or deemed approved by the
operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this Section 18. 92. 090. The
approval authority shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case- by- case
basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to allow for the proper
operation of the approved facility consistent with the goals of this chapter.
A. Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any applications to the Building
Division, the permittee must incorporate this permit, all conditions associated with this permit and
the approved photo simulations into the project plans ( the " Approved Plans"). The permittee
must construct, install and operate the wireless facility in strict compliance with the Approved
Plans. Any alterations, modifications or other changes to the Approved Plans, whether requested
by the permittee or required by other departments or public agencies with jurisdiction over the
wireless facility, must be submitted in a written request subject to the Zoning Administrator' s prior
review and approval, who may refer the request to the original approval authority if the Zoning
Administrator finds that the requested alteration, modification or other change implicates a
significant or substantial land- use concern.
B. Permit Duration. This permit will automatically expire 10 years and one day from
its issuance, except when California Government Code § 65964( b), as may be amended or
superseded in the future, authorizes the City to establish a shorter term for public safety or
18. 92 ( 12) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)

substantial land use reasons. Any other permits or approvals issued in connection with any
collocation, modification or other change to this wireless facility, which includes without limitation
any permits or other approvals deemed- granted or deemed- approved under federal or state law,
will not extend this term limit unless expressly provided otherwise in such permit or approval or
required under federal or state law.
C. Build- out Period. This permit will automatically expire one year from the issuance
date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct
and/ or operate the approved wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or
approvals required by any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject
property, the wireless facility or its use. The Zoning Administrator may grant one written extension
to a date certain when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written
request for an extension submitted at least 30 days prior to the automatic expiration date in this
condition.
D. Maintenance Obligations; Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which
includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes,
fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the
Approved Plans and all conditions in this permit. The permittee shall keep the site area free from
all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the City, shall remove and remediate
any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within 48 hours after the permittee receives notice or
otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.
E. Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with
all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law
Laws") applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the wireless facility or any use or
activities in connection with the use authorized in this permit. The permittee expressly
acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no
other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen
the permittee' s obligations to maintain compliance with all Laws.
F. Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable
efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may
arise from the permittee' s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair,
removal and/ or other activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to
perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or
other work that involves heavy equipment or machines on ( 1) any weekday or Saturday between
7 PM and 7 AM or ( 2) any Sunday or holiday. The restricted work hours in this condition will not
prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any
work during an emergency declared by the City. The Zoning Administrator or the Zoning
Administrator's designee may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition.
G. Noise Complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the site in
compliance with the ambient noise standards in Chapter 8. 32 applicable to the zone in which the
site is situated. In the event that any person files a noise complaint and the City verifies that such
complaint is valid, the permittee must remedy the violation within 10 days after notice from the
City, which may include a demonstration that the permittee has amended its operational
guidelines in situations where the violation arises from the permittee' s personnel rather than the
permittee' s equipment.
H. Inspections; Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that
the City or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment
upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the City or its designee
may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair,
disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements
or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be
permitted to supervise the City or its designee while such inspection or emergency access occurs.
18. 92 ( 13) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)
Vista Municipal Code
I. Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the Planning Division with
accurate and up-to- date contact information for a person responsible for the wireless facility,
which includes without limitation such person' s full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile
number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information
up-to- date at all times.
J. Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which
the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its agents,
officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all ( 1) damages, liabilities, injuries,
losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs and other
actions or proceedings (" Claims") brought against the City or its agents, officers, officials,
employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the City' s
approval of this permit, and ( 2) other Claims any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death
or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee' s or its agents', directors',

connection with this permit or the wireless facility. In the event the City becomes aware of any
Claims, the City will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property
owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges
and agrees that the City shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, the legal counsel providing the City' s defense, and the property owner and/ or permittee
as applicable) shall promptly reimburse City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily
incurred by the City in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the permittee' s indemnification obligations under this condition are a material
consideration that motivates the City to approve this permit, and that such indemnification
obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this permit.
K. Performance Bond. Before the Building Official issues any construction permit in
connection with the wireless facility, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety
and in a form acceptable to the City Manager and the City Attorney in an amount equal to or
greater than a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities
removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other
improvements, which includes without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators,
utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters,
towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or
installed in connection with the wireless facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount
required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code § 65964(a),
the City Manager shall take into consideration information provided by the permittee regarding
the cost to remove the wireless facility.
L. Recall to the Approval Authority. The original approval authority may recall this
permit for review at any time due to complaints about noncompliance with the Vista Development
Code or any approval conditions. At a duly noticed public hearing and in accordance with all
applicable laws, the approval authority may revoke this permit or amend these conditions as the
approval authority deems necessary or appropriate to correct any such noncompliance.
M. Record Retention. The permittee shall retain full and complete copies of all permits
and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the wireless facility, which includes
without limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans, resolutions and other documentation
associated with the permit or regulatory approval. In the event that the City cannot locate any
such full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in its official records, and the
permittee fails to retain full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in the permittee' s
files, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an examination of the
missing documents will be conclusively resolved against the permittee.

Section 18. 92. 100 Amortization of Nonconforming Wireless Facilities
Any non- conforming wireless facilities in existence at the time this Chapter becomes
effective must be brought into conformance with this Chapter in accordance with the amortization
schedule in this Section 18. 92. 100. As used in this section, the " fair market value" will be the
construction costs listed on the building permit application for the subject wireless facility and the
minimum years" allowed will be measured from the date on which this Chapter becomes
effective.
Fair Market Value on Effective Date Minimum Years Allowed

The Zoning Administrator may grant a written extension to a date certain when the wireless
facility owner shows ( 1) a good faith effort to cure non- conformance; ( 2) the application of this
Section would violate applicable laws; or ( 3) extreme economic hardship would result from strict
compliance with the amortization schedule. Any extension must be the minimum time period
necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The Zoning Administrator may not grant
any permanent exemption from this Section.
Nothing in this Section is intended to limit any permit term to less than 10 years. In the
event that the amortization required in this Section would reduce the permit term to less than 10
years for any permit granted on or after September 29, 2006, then the minimum years allowed
will be automatically extended by the difference between 10 years and the number of years since
the City granted such permit. Nothing in this Section is intended or may be applied to prohibit any
collocation or modification covered under 47 U. S. C. § 1455(a) on the basis that the subject
wireless facility is a legal nonconforming wireless facility.

Section 18. 92. 110 Temporary Wireless Facilities
A. Temporary Wireless Facilities for Non- Emergencies.
1. Administrative Temporary Use Permit Applications. The Zoning
Administrator shall not approve any temporary wireless facility subject to an administrative
temporary use permit except upon a duly filed application consistent with this Section
18. 92. 110( a) and any other written rules the Zoning Administrator may publish in any publiclystated
format. Applicants for an administrative temporary use permit must submit, at a minimum:
1) an administrative temporary use permit application on the most current form prepared by the
Planning Division; ( 2) the applicable fee for the application; ( 3) a site plan that shows the proposed
temporary wireless facility and its equipment, physical dimensions and placement on the
proposed site relative to property lines and existing structures; ( 4) an RF compliance report in
accordance with Section 18. 92. 050( b)( 6) in this Chapter; and ( 5) an insurance certificate for
general commercial liability that names the City as an additional insured, includes coverage for
the time period in which the temporary wireless facility will be placed and carries at least
1, 000, 000 in coverage per occurrence. Applications must be submitted in person to the Zoning
Administrator. No pre- submittal conference or appointment is required for a temporary
administrative use permit application.
2. Administrative Review Procedures. After the Zoning Administrator receives
a duly filed application for an administrative temporary use permit, the Zoning Administrator shall
review the application for completeness. After the Zoning Administrator deems the application
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall review the application for conformance with the required
findings in Section 18. 92. 110( a)( 3) and render a written decision to the applicant. Any denials
18. 92 ( 15) Vista 1/ 10/ 19)

must include the reasons for the denial. The review shall be administrative in nature and shall not
require notice or a public hearing. In the event that the Zoning Administrator denies an
administrative temporary use permit for a temporary wireless facility, the applicant may appeal to
the City Manager within 10 days. The City Manager shall consider the appeal de novo and the
City Manager's decision will be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals.
3. Required Findings. The Zoning Administrator may approve or conditionally
approve an administrative temporary use permit for a temporary wireless facility only when the
Zoning Administrator finds all the following:
a. The proposed temporary wireless facility will not exceed 50 feet in
overall height above ground level;
b. The proposed temporary wireless facility complies with all setback
requirements applicable to the proposed location;
C. The proposed temporary wireless facility will not involve any
excavation or ground disturbance;
d. The proposed temporary wireless facility will be compliant with all
generally applicable public health and safety laws and regulations, which includes without
limitation maximum permissible exposure limits for human exposure to RF emissions established
by the FCC;
e. The proposed temporary wireless facility will not create any
nuisance or violate any noise limits applicable to the proposed location;
f. The proposed temporary wireless facility will be identified with a
sign that clearly identifies the site operator and contains a working telephone number to a live
person who can exert power-down control over the antennas;
g. The proposed wireless temporary wireless facility will be removed
within five days after the Zoning Administrator grants the administrative temporary use permit, or
such longer time as the Zoning Administrator finds reasonably related to the applicant' s need or
purpose for the temporary wireless facility;
h. The applicant has not received any other administrative temporary
use permit for substantially the same location within the previous 90 days; and
i. The applicant has not sought approval for any permanent wireless
facility in substantially the same location within the previous 365 days.
B. Temporary Wireless Facilities for Emergencies. Temporary wireless facilities may
be placed and operated within the City without an administrative temporary use permit only when
a duly authorized federal, state, county or City official declares an emergency within a region that
includes the City in whole or in part. Any temporary wireless facilities placed pursuant to this
Section 18. 92. 110( b) must be removed within five days after the date the emergency is lifted
whichever occurs first). Any person or entity that places temporary wireless facilities pursuant to
this section must send a written notice that identifies the site location and person responsible for
its operation to the Zoning Administrator as soon as reasonably practicable.

Section 18. 94.010 Legislative Intent
A. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub.
L. 112- 96, codified in 47 U. S. C. § 1455( a), generally requires that State and local governments
may not deny, and shall approve" requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission
equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communication Commission regulations
interpret this statute and create procedural rules for local review, which generally preempt certain
subjective land- use regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the
applicant with a potential " deemed granted" remedy when the State or local government fails to
approve or deny the request within sixty ( 60) days after submittal ( accounting for any tolling
periods). Moreover, whereas Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104,
codified in 47 U. S. C. § 332, applies to only " personal wireless service facilities" ( e. g., cellular
telephone towers and equipment), Section 6409(a) applies to all " wireless" facilities licensed or
authorized by the FCC ( e. g., cellular, Wi- Fi, satellite, microwave backhaul, etc.).
B. The City Council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered
under Section 6409(a) and other wireless deployments, combined with the different substantive
and procedural rules applicable to such deployments, creates a potential for confusion that harms
the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community
development in accordance with local values. The City Council further finds that a separate permit
application and review process specifically designed for compliance with Section 6409( a)
contained in a section devoted to Section 6409(a) will mitigate such potential confusion,
streamline local review and preserve the city's land- use authority to maximum extent possible.
C. The City of Vista intends this section to establish reasonable and uniform
standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health, safety and
welfare, consistent with and subject to federal and California state law, for wireless facilities
collocations and modifications pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and
Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112- 96, codified in 47 U. S. C. § 1455(a), and related FCC
regulations codified in 47 C. F. R. §§ 1. 40001 et seq. This section is not intended to, nor shall it be
interpreted or applied to: ( 1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider's
ability to provide personal wireless services; ( 2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity' s ability
to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory rules or regulation for rights-of-way management; (3) unreasonably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (4) deny any request for
authorization to place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of
18. 94 ( l) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)

environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such wireless facilities
comply with the FCC' s regulations concerning such emissions; ( 5) prohibit any collocation or
modification that the City may not deny under federal or California state law; or ( 6) otherwise
authorize the City to preempt any applicable federal or California state law.

Approval Authority" means the commission, board or official responsible for review of
permit applications and vested with the authority to approve or deny such applications. The
approval authority for a project which requires a Section 6409(a) approval refers to the Zoning
Administrator.
Base Station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1), as
may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that
enables FCC- licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a
communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 9) or any equipment associated with a tower. The term includes, but is not limited to,
equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and
public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such
as microwave backhaul. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas,
coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment,
regardless of technological configuration ( including distributed antenna systems and small- cell
networks). The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant
application is filed with the State or local government under this section, supports or houses
equipment described in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1)( i)-( ii) that has been reviewed and approved
under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review
process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such
support. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed
with the State or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment
described in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 1)( i)-( ii).
Collocation" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 2), as
may be amended, which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission
equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/ or receiving radio
frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC' s
definition effectively means " to add" and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless
facility installed at a single site.
Eligible Facilities Request" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 3), as may be amended, which defines that term as any request for modification of an
existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such
tower or base station, involving: ( i) collocation of new transmission equipment; ( ii) removal of
transmission equipment; or ( iii) replacement of transmission equipment.
Eligible Support Structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 4), as may be amended, which defines that term as any tower or base station as
18. 94 ( 2) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)

defined in this section, provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with
the State or local government under this section.
Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 4), as may
be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of
the FCC' s Section 6409(a) regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable
zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided that
a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was
built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.
FCC" means the Federal Communications Commission or its duly appointed successor
agency.
Personal Wireless Services" means the same as defined in 47 U. S. C. § 332( c)( 7)( C)( i),
as may be amended, which defines the term as commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless
services and common carrier wireless exchange access services.
Personal Wireless Service Facilities" means the same as defined in 47 U. S. C. §
332( c)( 7)( C)( i), as may be amended, which defines the term as facilities that provide personal
wireless services.
RF" means radio frequency or electromagnetic waves between 30 kHz and 300 GHz in
the electromagnetic spectrum range.
Section 6409(a)" means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation
Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U. S. C. § 1455( a), as may be
amended.
Site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 6), as may be
amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights- of-way, the current
boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility
easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted
to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed
on the ground.
Substantial Change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular
wireless facility type ( tower or base station) and location ( in or outside the public right- of-way).
For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC' s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change
according to the wireless facility type and location.
A. For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:
1. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more
than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed 20 feet ( whichever is
greater); or
2. The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20
feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the
appurtenance (whichever is greater); or
3. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more
than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four;
or
4. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the
current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any
access or utility easements currently related to the site.
B. For towers in the public rights- of-way and for all base stations, a substantial
change occurs when:
1. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more
than 10% or 10 feet (whichever is greater); or
2. The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 6
feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or
18. 94 ( 3) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
3. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any
new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground- mounted equipment
cabinets; or
4. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any
new ground- mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent ( 10%) larger in height or volume
than any existing ground- mounted equipment cabinets; or
5. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the
area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the
ground.
C. In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change
occurs when:
1. The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing
concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the Director; or
2. The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of
approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of
approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the
thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.
Note: The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The failure
to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would
occur. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally
separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally- permitted support
structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the
original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured
from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress
passed Section 6409( a).
Tower" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. § 1. 40001( b)( 9), as may be
amended, which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any FCC- licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including
structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to,
private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed
wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but
are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees and lattice towers.
Transmission Equipment" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates
transmission for any FCC- licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but
not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup
power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services
including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed
wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.
Wireless" means any FCC- licensed or authorized wireless communication service
transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Section 18. 94.050 Permit Applications
A. Application Requirement. The City shall not approve any wireless facility subject
to this Chapter except upon a duly filed application consistent with this Section 18. 94.050 and any
other written rules the City or the Zoning Administrator may establish from time to time in any
publicly-stated format.
B. Application Content. The materials required under this section are minimum
requirements for any application.
1. Master Application and Applicable Fee. The applicant must provide the
applicable minor use permit application form with the applicable application fee.
2. Title Report and Owner's Authorization. For facilities proposed or located
on private property, the applicant must provide a title report prepared within the six months prior
to the application filing date in order for the City to verify the property owner's identity. No title
report is required for facilities proposed or located in the public rights- of-way. If the applicant does
not own the subject property or the support structure in the public rights- of-way, the application
must include a written authorization signed by the property owner that empowers the applicant to
file the application and perform all wireless facility construction, installation, operation and
maintenance to the extent described in the application.
3. Regulatory Authorizations. To the extent that the applicant claims any
regulatory authorization or other right to use the public rights- of-way, such as a Certificate of
Public Convenience and Necessity, the applicant must provide a true and correct copy of the
certificate, license, notice to proceed or other regulatory authorization that supports the applicant's
claim.
4. Prior Regulatory Approvals. Evidence that the applicant holds all current
licenses and registrations from the FCC and any other applicable regulatory bodies where such
license( s) or registration( s) are necessary to provide wireless services utilizing the proposed
wireless facility. For any prior local regulatory approval( s) associated with the wireless facility, the
applicant must submit copies of all such approvals, including any corresponding approved project
plans and conditions of approval. Alternatively, the applicant may submit a written justification that
sets forth reasons why prior regulatory approvals were not required for the wireless facility at the
time it was constructed or modified.
5. Project Plans. A fully dimensioned site plan and elevation drawings
prepared and sealed by a California- licensed engineer showing any existing wireless facilities
with all existing transmission equipment and other improvements, the proposed wireless facility
with all proposed transmission equipment and other improvements and the legal boundaries of
the leased or owned area surrounding the proposed wireless facility and any associated access
18. 94 ( 5) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
or utility easements. The plans must specifically depict and call out the original overall height of
the structure and, if the structure was constructed prior to February 22, 2012, the overall height
that existed on February 22, 2012. The plans must contain all other elements and details required
for site plans submitted with a special use permit application.
6. Site Photos and Photo Simulations. Photographs and photo simulations
that show the proposed wireless facility in context of the site from reasonable line- of-sight
locations from public streets or other adjacent viewpoints, together with a map that shows the
photo location of each view angle.
7. RF Compliance Demonstration. An RF exposure compliance report
prepared and certified by an RF engineer acceptable to the City that certifies that the proposed
wireless facility, as well as any collocated wireless facilities, will comply with applicable federal
RF exposure standards and exposure limits. The RF report must include the actual frequency and
power levels ( in watts effective radiated power ( ERP)) for all existing and proposed antennas at
the site and exhibits that show the location and orientation of all transmitting antennas and the
boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the uncontrolled/ general population limit (as
that term is defined by the FCC) and also the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess
of the controlled/ occupational limit (as that term is defined by the FCC). Each such boundary shall
be clearly marked and identified for every transmitting antenna at the project site.
8. Acoustic Analysis. A written report that analyzes acoustic levels for the
proposed wireless facility and all associated equipment including without limitation all
environmental control units, sump pumps, temporary backup power generators, and permanent
backup power generators in order to demonstrate compliance with Chapter 8. 32 ( Noise Control).
The acoustic analysis must be prepared and certified by an engineer and include an analysis of
the manufacturers' specifications for all noise- emitting equipment and a depiction of the proposed
equipment relative to all adjacent property lines. In lieu of a written report, the applicant may
submit evidence from the equipment manufacturer that the ambient noise emitted from all the
proposed equipment will not, both individually and cumulatively, exceed the applicable limits.
9. Section 6409( a) Justification Analysis. A written statement that explains in
plain factual detail whether and why Section 6409(a) and the related FCC regulations at 47 C. F. R.
1. 40001 et seq. require approval for the specific project. A complete written narrative analysis
will state the applicable standard and all the facts that allow the City to conclude the standard has
been met—bare conclusions not factually supported do not constitute a complete written analysis.
As part of this written statement the applicant must also include ( i) whether and why the support
structure qualifies as an existing tower or existing base station; and ( ii) whether and why the
proposed collocation or modification does not cause a substantial change in height, width,
excavation, equipment cabinets, concealment or permit compliance.
C. Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. The City shall not review any application
unless duly filed in accordance with the provisions in this Section 18. 94. 050( c).
1. Pre- Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, applicants must
schedule and attend a pre- application meeting with City staff for all proposed modifications
submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a). The pre- submittal conference is intended to
streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the
appropriate project classification, including whether the project qualifies for Section 6409( a); any
latent issues in connection with the existing tower or base station; potential concealment issues
if applicable); coordination with other City departments responsible for application review; and
application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application
incompleteness, applicants are encouraged ( but not required) to bring any draft applications or
other materials so that City staff may provide informal feedback about whether such applications
or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Zoning Administrator may, in the
Zoning Administrator' s discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under
Section 18. 94.050( c)( 2) and/ or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any
18. 94 ( 6) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
applicant who ( i) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre-submittal conference and ( ii)
shows to the Zoning Administrator' s satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates
information already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to
the City' s review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will
be limited to the project discussed at the pre- submittal conference and will not be extended to any
other project.
2. Submittal Appointment. All applications must be filed with the City at a prescheduled
appointment. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but
may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not
prejudicial to other applicants. Any application received without an appointment, whether
delivered in- person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the
applicant received a written exemption from the Zoning Administrator at a pre-submittal
conference.
3. Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal
process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request to the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment
as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received.
D. Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions,
an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails
to tender a substantive response to the City within 90 calendar days after the City deems the
application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Zoning Administrator may, in the
Zoning Administrator' s discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 calendar
days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to
grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant' s reasonable control will
be considered good cause to grant the extension.
E. Departmental Forms, Rules and Other Regulations. The City Council authorizes
the Zoning Administrator to develop and publish permit application forms, checklists, informational
handouts and other related materials that the Zoning Administrator finds necessary, appropriate
or useful for processing requests for Section 6409(a) approvals. Without further authorization from
the City Council, the Zoning Administrator may from time- to-time update and alter any such permit
application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials as the Zoning
Administrator deems necessary, appropriate or useful to respond to regulatory, technological or
other changes related to this Chapter. The City Council authorizes the Zoning Administrator to
establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular
hours for appointments with applicants, as the Zoning Administrator deems necessary or
appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and
regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.
Ord. No. 2017- 7, Added, 5/ 9/ 17)
Section 18. 94.060 Decisions
A. Administrative Review; Decision Notices. The Zoning Administrator shall
administratively review an application for a Section 6409( a) approval and may act on such an
application without prior notice or a public hearing. Within five working days after the Zoning
Administrator conditionally approves or denies an application submitted for approval pursuant to
Section 6409( a) or before the FCC timeframe for review expires ( whichever occurs first), the
Zoning Administrator shall send a written notice to the applicant. In the event that the Zoning
Administrator determines that an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409( a)
does not qualify for approval, the Zoning Administrator will send written notice to the applicant
that includes the reasons to support the approval authority' s decision and states that the
18. 94 ( 7) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
application will be automatically denied without prejudice on the 60th day after the date the
application was filed unless the applicant withdraws the application.
B. Required Findings for Approval. The Zoning Administrator may approve or
conditionally approve an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) when it
finds that the proposed project:
1 . Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission equipment on
an existing wireless tower or base station; and
2. Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing
wireless tower or base station.
C. Criteria for Denial Without Prejudice. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Chapter, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the Zoning Administrator
may deny without prejudice an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409( a)
when it finds that the proposed project:
1 . Does not satisfy the criteria for approval;
2. Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably
related to public health and safety then in effect; or
3. Involves the replacement of the entire support structure.
D. Conditional Approvals. Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state law,
nothing in this Chapter is intended to limit the City' s authority to conditionally approve an
application for a Section 6409(a) approval to protect and promote the public health, safety and
welfare.
E. Appeals. Any applicant may appeal a decision by the Zoning Administrator's
decision to deny without prejudice a Section 6409(a) application. The appeal must be filed within
10 days from the Zoning Administrator' s decision. The appeal must state in plain terms the
grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The City Manager shall serve as
the appellate authority for all appeals of all actions of the Zoning Administrator taken pursuant to
this Chapter. The City Manager shall limit its review to whether the project should be approved or
denied in accordance with the provisions in Section 18. 94. 060( b)-( c). The decision of the City
Manager shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals.
Ord. No. 2017- 7, Added, 5/ 9/ 17)
Section 18. 94.070 Standard Conditions of Approval
In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approval authority, all special use permits
and minor use permits, whether approved by the approval authority or deemed approved by the
operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this Section 18. 94.070. The
approval authority shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case- by- case
basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to allow for the proper
operation of the approved facility consistent with the goals of this chapter.
A. Permit Term. The City' s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409( a)
approval constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or other prior
regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station. The City' s grant or grant by
operation of law of a Section 6409( a) approval will not extend the permit term, if any, for any minor
use permit, special use permit or other underlying prior regulatory authorization. Accordingly, the
term for a Section 6409(a) approval shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other prior
regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station.
B. Accelerated Permit Terms Due to Invalidation. In the event that any court of
competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section 6409( a) or any FCC rule that interprets
Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for any Section 6409( a)
approval( s), such approval( s) shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the
18. 94 ( 8) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
judicial order, unless the decision would not authorize accelerated termination of previously
approved Section 6409(a) approvals or the Zoning Administrator grants an extension upon written
request from the permittee that shows good cause for the extension, which includes without
limitation extreme financial hardship. Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the
contrary, the Zoning Administrator may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension.
A permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated
Section 6409(a) approval when it has submitted an application for either a minor use permit or
special use permit for those improvements before the one- year period ends.
C. No Waiver of Standing. The City' s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section
6409(a) approval does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the City
to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any Section 6409( a)
approval.
D. Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any applications to the Building
Division, the permittee must incorporate this Section 6409( a) approval, all conditions associated
with this Section 6409( a) approval and the approved photo simulations into the project plans ( the
Approved Plans"). The permittee must construct, install and operate the wireless facility in strict
compliance with the Approved Plans. Any alterations, modifications or other changes to the
Approved Plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or public
agencies with jurisdiction over the wireless facility, must be submitted in a written request subject
to the Zoning Administrator' s prior review and approval, who may revoke the Section 6409( a)
approval if the Zoning Administrator finds that the requested alteration, modification or other
change may cause a substantial change as that term is defined by the FCC in 47 C. F. R. §
1. 40001( b)( 7), as may be amended.
E. Build- out Period. This Section 6409( a) approval will automatically expire one year
from the issuance date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to
install, construct and/ or operate the approved wireless facility, which includes without limitation
any permits or approvals required by any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction
over the subject property, the wireless facility or its use. The Zoning Administrator may grant one
written extension to a date certain when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations
period in a written request for an extension submitted at least 30 days prior to the automatic
expiration date in this condition.
F. Maintenance Obligations; Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which
includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes,
fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the
Approved Plans and all conditions in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee shall keep the
site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the City, shall
remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within 48 hours after the permittee
receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.
G. Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with
all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law
Laws") applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the wireless facility or any use or
activities in connection with the use authorized in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee
expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and
that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise
lessen the permittee' s obligations to maintain compliance with all Laws.
H. Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable
efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may
arise from the permittee' s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair,
removal and/ or other activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to
perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or
18. 94 ( 9) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
other work that involves heavy equipment or machines on ( 1) any weekday or Saturday between
7 PM and 7 AM or ( 2) any Sunday or holiday. The restricted work hours in this condition will not
prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any
work during an emergency declared by the City. The Zoning Administrator or the Zoning
Administrator's designee may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition.
I. Noise Complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the site in
compliance with the ambient noise standards in Chapter 8. 32 applicable to the zone. In the event
that any person files a noise complaint and the City verifies that such complaint is valid, the
permittee must remedy the violation within 10 days after notice from the City, which may include
a demonstration that the permittee has amended its operational guidelines in situations where the
violation arises from the permittee' s personnel rather than the permittee' s equipment.
J. Inspections; Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that
the City or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment
upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the City or its designee
may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair,
disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements
or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be
permitted to supervise the City or its designee while such inspection or emergency access occurs.
K. Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the Planning Division with
accurate and up-to- date contact information for a person responsible for the wireless facility,
which includes without limitation such person' s full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile
number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information
up-to- date at all times.
L. Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which
the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its agents,
officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all ( 1) damages, liabilities, injuries,
losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs and other
actions or proceedings (" Claims") brought against the City or its agents, officers, officials,
employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the City' s
approval of this Section 6409(a) approval, and ( 2) other Claims any kind or form, whether for
personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee' s or
its agents', directors', officers', employees', contractors', subcontractors', licensees', or
customers' acts or omissions in connection with this Section 6409(a) approval or the wireless
facility. In the event the City becomes aware of any Claims, the City will use best efforts to
promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in
the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the City shall have the right
to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the
City' s defense, and the property owner and/ or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse
City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the City in the course of the
defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee' s indemnification
obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the City to approve
this Section 6409( a) approval, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration
or revocation of this Section 6409(a) approval.
M. Performance Bond. Before the Building Official issues any construction permit in
connection with the wireless facility, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety
and in a form acceptable to the City Manager in an amount equal to or greater than a written
estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written
estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes
without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets,
hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations,
18. 94 ( 10) Vista 6/ 9/ 17)
Vista Municipal Code
whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the wireless
facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in
accordance with California Government Code § 65964( a), the City Manager shall take into
consideration information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless
facility.
N. Recall to the Approval Authority. The original approval authority may recall this
Section 6409(a) approval for review at any time due to complaints about noncompliance with the
Vista Development Code or any approval conditions. At a duly noticed public hearing and in
accordance with all applicable laws, the approval authority may revoke this Section 6409( a)
approval or amend these conditions as the approval authority deems necessary or appropriate to
correct any such noncompliance.
O. Record Retention. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of
all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the wireless facility, which
includes without limitation this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated
into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or
approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not
maintain such records as required in this condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would
be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee.

unreasonable. The Council shall adopt a resolution formalizing its findings and containing legal
descriptions of each property, the charge to be imposed on each property, and the identity of
the property owner. If a charge is approved, a certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded

charge, the Council may only approve the charge by the affirmative vote of at least four of its
members.
D. In the event the developer constructs the improvements before the Council
hearing, the City shall not be obligated to reimburse the developer out of City funds should the
Council not establish the charge, area of benefit or local benefit district, and all risk of such
failure to levy the charge shall be the developer' s.
E. In the event the developer requests City Council action prior to the construction
of said improvements, the City Engineer may, upon final approval and signing of improvement
drawings, determine the amount of reimbursement based on the submitted engineer's cost
estimate. The City Council' s action pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall be a
declaration of its intention based on such estimates. The City Council shall hold a second
hearing, with appropriate notice, findings and resolution, to actually establish the charges and
areas based upon as- built costs after completion and acceptance of the improvements.

his predecessor in interest has not paid such charges to the City, the charge established
thereunder shall be paid prior to the filing of the final map or parcel map or the issuance of the
building permit; provided, however, that such payment shall not be required in connection with

referenced resolution per the " h. 15" report as published by the Federal Reserve. This interest
rate shall be fixed and applied for the entire life of the agreement, compounded annually, and
prorated for any partial year. Upon the payment of such charge, the City Clerk shall record with

Pursuant to the authority granted under the California Tree Planting Act of 1931,
commencing with Section 22000 of the California Streets and Highways Code, the Director of
Public Works is authorized to undertake the following activities.
A. Removal of Trees. The Director of Public Works, and any assistants or agents,
is authorized and empowered to enter upon any property within the City for the purpose of
removing any tree or any part of any tree which appears to be dead, is liable to fall, is
dangerous or is an obstruction to public travel, whether or not the tree is on any private property
and overhangs or projects into any street or is in any street, park, parkway or other public
grounds of the City.
B. Notice for Removal of Tree, Emergency Exception. Except in the case of
manifest public danger and immediate necessity, no tree shall be wholly cut down or removed
unless ten days' notice in writing is given to the owner, tenant, or occupant, or agent of the
owner, tenant, or occupant of the land upon which the tree is situated. If the owner, tenant, or
occupant, or an agent thereof, cannot be found or located, such notice may be given by

registered mail, first class postage pre- paid, to the last known owner of record of the property,
as such owner is shown on the most recent assessment roll of the County Assessor.
C. Owner' s Objection to Removal; Determination by City Manager. If, within seven
days after notice has been given under Subdivision B above, the owner, tenant, occupant, or
agent files with the Director of Public Works a written objection to the removal, the Director shall
not cut down or remove the tree and shall instead set the matter for a hearing before the City
Manager. The objecting party shall then be given a further written notice of the time, date and
place of the hearing at least ten days in advance of such hearing. At the hearing, the Director of
Public Works shall present to the City Manager the reasons for removing the tree. The
objecting party shall have a reasonable opportunity to address the City Manager and to respond
to all information presented to the City Manager, following which the City Manager shall
determine whether or not the tree shall be removed. The decision of the City Manager shall be
final.

within the time specified for such abatement by the Director of Public Works, the Director of
Public Works shall prepare and issue a Notice of Hearing pursuant to Section 8. 36.080 of this

defined in Section 19. 24. 140 is found to exist within a public street or right- of-way, the Director
of Public Works is authorized to proceed with the abatement of such nuisance. The authority to

abutting such public street or right- of-way on which the nuisance is found from the duty to abate
such nuisance, pursuant to Section 19. 24. 150.
